<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #09-03 - RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Computing Technology Applications Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to explore and develop computer architectures with greater capacity, sophistication and assurance for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), trusted/secure systems and performance requirement driven layered information processing battlefield networks. Additional innovative technology developments are sought for technologies that will enable the development of and affordable acquisition of large-scale, complex, software-intensive systems through the development of tools, techniques, standards, and technologies.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are technologies that support architectures for high assurance, trusted/secure architectures, increased computational sophistication, more complex system functionality with improved quality, dramatic improvements in the performance/cost of systems, embedded processing and high productivity computing. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce warfighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times, automate the labor-intensive/error-prone and costly aspects of system software development, improved reliability, longevity, and useability of new and legacy military computing systems.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include multi-core processing architectures with emphasis on hardware support for semantic operations, power reducing/power management/power aware processing architectures, high assurance/trusted/secure processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, self-aware computing systems, data storage, performance optimization visualization tools, mobile and wireless networks and technologies necessary to achieve exa-scale computing. Examples of software technologies include High Performance Computing (HPC) programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, static and dynamic runtime optimization and resource management. (2) Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS): This area consists of research into the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPU's, FPGA's, etc.) and development of solutions for associated security issues to alleviate the impact on the Separation Kernels that are being developed by the real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurance. Advance the state of the art through research and development of high assurance middleware technologies for insertion in mission critical embedded systems in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of superior and timely information to the warfighter. Develop protection profiles according to the Common Criteria for middleware security components in the Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety architecture. (3) Software Producibility/Software Intensive Systems: Software is a prime enabler of complex weapons systems and command and control infrastructure, yet it is the least well understood and the most problematic element of large-scale systems. Software project failures dominated by unmet requirements and cost and schedule overruns abound, in large part due to little underlying science, a minimal engineering knowledge base and a lack of understanding of the physics of software. The complexity of today's system lies in greater than 105 requirements, greater than 107 lines of code, thousands or more component interactions, greater than 30 year product life cycles and stringent certification standards. Technologies, methodologies, techniques, and tools to specify, design, build, verify and test software that will enable the development and affordable, timely, and predictable acquisition of complex, software-intensive systems is being sought. Areas of interest include: software and systems composability with guaranteed system interoperability for provably trusted components and systems; model-based development for predictable software attributes with provably correct code generation and automatic software and system analysis; dynamic, scalable and adaptive software debugging; software mechanisms to fully exploit emerging technology, such as multi-core, in producing new software or modernizing legacy systems; mechanisms to fight through software failures; technology that will increase our understanding of software; and the development of an infrastructure for software-intensive systems modeled after the Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification Guideline DO-178B. (4) Formal architectures for the development of verifiably secure systems: This area includes the development of formal, architectural approaches for the design and development of secure systems. The principle research in this area should study powerful, new notions and related formal methods to underlie the approach, including appropriate forms of composition, model transformation, refinement, and general characterizations of security properties. This research must include the demonstration of the feasibility of the approach, and the development of a proof of concept. (5) High Assurance/Trusted Computing Architectures: The objective of this topic is to investigate the necessary building blocks for high assurance computing environments (environments where compelling evidence is supplied to determine a high level of trustworthiness), including both the underlying hardware and software to support it. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (a) the problems and challenges with current processor designs for trustworthiness and their solutions; (b) the problems and challenges with current computer architectures for trustworthiness and solutions to them; (c) the Operating System level constructs, objects and functions that must be provided to complement the hardware to enable a trustworthy computing base; (d) the state of the art software-based assurance designs, methodologies or concepts which are better suited for implementation in hardware than software. This area is also interested in research and development for increasing the level of trustworthiness of integrated circuit designs, commodity integrated circuits and currently available systems as a whole. Finally, this area is also interested in research in the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures (including multi-core, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) and specially designed processor architectures in support of Separation Kernels and other secure micro-kernels being developed by real-time operating system vendors for use in environments requiring high assurances, develop solutions for such implications, and also research and develop supporting software, e.g. high assurance middleware technologies, in order to enhance system interoperability and capability to support cross domain solutions that will enable delivery of trustworthy, superior and timely information.</p>

<DESC>The Interim Airborne Gateway system is envsioned as a remotely controlled integrated communications package installed on an Unmanned Aerial System used to address voice and data system incompatibilities, including range limitations, to facilitate seamless exchange of real-time space, air, and surface situational awareness (SA) and Command and Control (C2) information for the coordination and execution of joint mission engagements by friendly forces.  The IG program goal is the connectivity and interoperability of homogeneous and heterogeneous voice and data networks to allow the exchange of tactical battle-space information in support of tactical missions.  The IG Airborne Gateway  will also provide the ability to reach back to local and global command centers without a heavy reliance on satellite communications or an entrenched ground fiber network, neither of which may be in future battle-grounds due to a lack of existing infrastructure or satellite coverage due to t! errain or emerging threats to satellite systems.  The IG system will interface with and handle data and voice from legacy tactical data links, advanced (IP-based) tactical data links, military and civilian voice radios, satellite communications, and terrestrial networks.  Projected IG users include fighter and bomber aircraft, airborne and ground C2 nodes, mobile and dismounted forces, first responders, command centers, and other users in the Global Information Grid (GIG).

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C. for Launch Services in support of the National Reconnaissance Office L-15 mission. One (1) mission will be added to the existing EELV Launch Services (ELS) contract with United Launch Services, L.L.C. This one (1) Launch Service will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required). The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any launch service (described above) as a result of this solicitation.
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A J&amp;A may permit Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to United Launch Services, L.L.C. subject to the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>The Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) has developed a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP). The NEEP defines a structured approach for the Wing to evaluate potential new entrants to perform Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan identifies the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The end result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, as to the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants are provided a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities (at their own expense), while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements.<br />Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the PCO (address below) about receiving a copy of the NEEP. Responses from Small Businesses are encouraged. NAICS Code is 541712 with 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Any interested parties (or new entrants) must (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal, (2) have successfully demonstrated two missions (intermediate or larger) that inserts payloads into their intended orbits, (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) as presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3, and (4) successfully complete the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense,. Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Lorraine Lewis-Wilson, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification time period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the missions identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Note 22.</p>

<DESC>NSWC Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Suite 17D, Panama City, FL 32407 on a sole-source basis to meet an urgent requirement for retrofit and related production support of fifty (50) Safety-Arming Devices, Dummy, MK 84 to support aircraft certification testing of the QUICKSTRIKE Mines MK 62 and MK 63 Mod 3.  Existing MK 84 hardware requires modification to meet revised design requirements and is required for aircraft certification testing scheduled for early 2009.  IPS has key design knowledge and Mod 3 and MK 84 production engineering experience required for this requirement.  The company and its personnel have critical technical knowledge pertaining to the aircraft arming wire configuration changes associated with the redesigned MK 84.  This technical knowledge is required for this effort to minimize production and technical risks associated with the retrofit and to meet the s! hort delivery dates for the retrofitted hardware.  IPS is historically the only company that can effectively perform the required modifications within the required timeframes.  Using any other source for this effort would significantly increase program schedule and technical risk.  The government estimates that using any other source for this effort would increase delivery time for this hardware by as much as 100% and cost by as much as 50%.  Delivery of the first twenty (20) modified Safety-Arming Devices, Dummy, MK 84 is required by 16 February 2009.  Remaining thirty (30) modified Safety-Arming Devices, Dummy, MK 84 are required by 17 April 2009.   Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 18pt">With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Chicago District issues this Pre-Solicitation Notice for Des Plaines Floodwall 37 Flow Improvements, Prospect Heights, Cook County, Illinois.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The classification code for this procurement is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 561730, with a Small Business Standard size of $7 Million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Competition for this acquisition is RESTRICTED TO CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS (100% SB SET-ASIDE).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Corps of Engineers intends to award a firm-fixed price Service contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Contract will consist of the Base work with 4 Option years for Site Management and Monitoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the first year, activities will consist of cutting and selective herbiciding of woody stems in both the 11-acre prairie area and in the 6.5-acre woodland area. The treatment method may include burning, mowing and the application of a selective herbicide such as Plateau, Garlon3A or Fusilade. Or herbaceous species control may include some combination of burning, mowing and selective, spot treatment with a broad-spectrum glyphosate-based herbicide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Site preparation for seeding, and seeding itself, will occur only in the 6.5-acre woodland portion. Site preparation will consist of 3-4 herbicide applications 6-8 weeks apart, to be followed by fall seeding. Seeding may also occur the following spring. Seed application with native woodland seed at the rate of 5 pounds per acre combined with cover crop seed at the rate of 75 pounds per acre will follow site preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">During the first growing season or two, mowing will be the primary management tool used to prevent weeds from excessively shading the native seedlings. Mowing or spot mowing once or twice during the second season at a cutting length to 6-12 inches is beneficial if weeds are thick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Selective or spot herbiciding may be necessary if a weed control problem is encountered that resists other methods of control. Spot treatment must be used only on cool, windless days. Overseeding will occur, if necessary, during site management and monitoring years to repair any areas where seeding was unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 18pt">After 2 or 3 growing seasons, most native plantings need to be burned annually for the following management and monitoring years to become well established, which produces greater diversity and better growth. The first annual prescribed burn at the flow site will occur during the spring of Site Management and Monitoring Year 3 and be followed again in Year 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining annual establishment period burns will become the responsibility of the Cook County Forest Preserve District. After establishment, mature prairies with no serious weed problems will need to be burned perhaps once every 3 years. <span style="color: #000000;">This project includes the selective removal of these woody invasive species from these two areas. This will be accomplished by</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1) Eliminating stems greater than 1 cm, up to 25 cm, at ground level of all non-native woody species. Criteria in the specification shall be used in making the determination which trees and shrubs will be removed. A qualified individual shall flag the periphery of the area or the trees to be cleared. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>2) To provide growing season follow-up control of resprouts </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">3) To dispose of cut brush by stockpiling and burning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mechanical clearing of trees and shrubs is permitted provided that the ground is frozen or dry to the extent that mechanical equipment will not cause the rutting or pitting of the soil. The Government would prefer that a Seppi mower or Royer mower be used for the mechanical removal of trees and shrubs, but will consider alternatives to this equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If mechanical equipment cannot maneuver then all cutting of woody vegetation shall be performed by hand using chain saws, brush clearing saws, hand saws and loppers.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Contractor must achieve a 90 percent success rate in the reduction of target species from the pre-existing condition in any given ten (10) square meters (107.6 square feet) within the cleared area. </span></p>

<DESC>The VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS) located in Denver, CO intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Associated Regional University Pathologist, 500 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, UT for specialized esoteric testing.  This contractor provides specialized esoteric testing that is required for correct determination of clinical diagnosis and treatment not available from other referral laboratories.  Testing is performed on blood, body fluids, tissue and urine.  Results are required for appropriate treatment of clinical conditions and test turnaround time must be minimal for prompt clinical intervention.  The contractor must perform a full range of testing required to avoid splitting of patient specimens and minimizing sample requirements.  This is a standard of care and accreditation mandate to reduce blood loss from specimen collections.  Many specimens are obtained through operative or other invasive procedures and cannot be split and sent to multiple labs.  This notice of intent is not for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, any laboratory that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within six (6) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.

Round Two (2) Lincoln County Archaeological Initiative 

The Lincoln County Land Act of 2004 provides that 85% of proceeds from the auction of public land in Lincoln County be placed in a trust account administered by the Secretary of the Interior.  One purpose of the trust account is to make funds available for inventory, evaluation, protection and management of unique archaeological resources in Lincoln County.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has established the Lincoln County Archaeological Initiative (LCAI) to allocate monies from the trust account for archaeological projects to carry out the purposes of the Land Act.  Proponents under this initiative will submit their proposals as outlined below.

I.  ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: 
Each year the BLM establishes priorities for LCAI archaeological projects and solicits nominations from the public and government agencies that address these priorities.  The nominated projects must be on federal administered land within Lincoln County, Nevada.  Nominated projects that do not meet these criteria will be rejected.

II. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: 1.	Nomination period duration is 30 days, beginning December 15, 2008 and ending January 15, 2009. 
2.	All nomination packages for Lincoln County Archaeological Initiatives are to be submitted to: 
Carol BassBureau of Land Management - Ely District Office HC 33, Box 33500Ely, NV  89301

III Project Categories At Risk Rock Art and Cave Sites in Lincoln County, Nevada:Document and evaluate rock art sites and caves   which are attractive nuisance evidenced by visitation and/or disturbance.
As more and more people spend time in Lincoln County, there is increased visitation to easily identifiable archaeological sites along travel routes, resulting in impacts to these sites. Examples of such areas are the rock art and cave sites near roads on the Desert and Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuges. 
The contractor is expected to document rock art sites and caves that are visible from travel routes and accessible to the passerby. The work will involve a review of the pertinent literature and known sites in the project area(s), followed by a field inventory. The contractor will evaluate each site for its archaeological potential and National Register eligibility, determine and describe past and present impacts to each site, and assess potential threats. An example of a threat assessment would be an analysis of distance to road or trail access in the vicinity of the site. 
The contractor will meet the Secretary of the Interior guidelines for qualified personnel and will maintain security of cultural resource information pertaining to the public lands as mutually agreed upon with the BLM.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all permits (from federal agencies) and permissions (for non-federal land, including private land) if the project is not located on land under the jurisdiction of the BLM.
Damage Assessments of Sites in Lincoln County, Nevada:Document and evaluate the effects of vandalism, other human impacts and/or the impacts of natural processes, such as erosion, on one or more sites.
In Lincoln County, some archaeological sites have been repeated targets of vandalism, have suffered from overuse of the area by visitors, or have been altered by natural processes, such as flash floods. The purpose of this project is to record the present condition of such a site(s), determine the impacts to the site(s), assess the archaeological potential and data loss, and conduct repair or restoration. The contractor is expected to have Federal Damage Assessment Training or can present evidence of completing successful damage assessments for a federal agency; to document and evaluate the effects of vandalism, other human impacts and natural processes on one or more sites. The contractor will develop and implement restoration, stabilization, and mitigation strategies to repair damage and recover data from the archaeological site(s) impacted by activities or actions. Examples of such sites on BLM land are the Delamar Township, the Sand Dune site, and the Evergreen site.  An example of such a site on the Desert and Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuges is data recovery at looted sites recorded by the Operation Indian Rocks case, particularly the Artifact Mine site.
The contractor will meet the Secretary of the Interior guidelines for qualified personnel and will maintain security of cultural resource information pertaining to the public lands as mutually agreed upon with the BLM.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all permits (from federal agencies) and permissions (for non-federal land, including private land) if the project is not located on land under the jurisdiction of the BLM.
Formative (Fremont) Settlements Inventory in Lincoln County, Nevada:Conduct Class III inventories and evaluation of areas at risk due to current or predicted increased public use.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information in Commercially Off the Shelf Software
<SOLNBR>RWS-121708
<RESPDATE>011509
<CONTACT>Robert W Sieferman, Contract Specialist, Phone 317-614-4590, Fax 317-298-1344, Email robert.sieferman@dhs.gov
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY and not a solicitation.

US Customs and Border Protection is in the process of developing a requirement for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) facilities life-cycle management software product to enhance acquisition tracking, accountability, sustainment and program management oversight of real property assets with the following scaleable capabilities:

- Vendor management to include performance tracking
- Real property Portfolio management
- Contract management 
- Facilities maintenance management; including preventative maintenance schedules
- Spatial management
- Utilities management
- Program management dashboard
- Workload Analysis
- Planning & Acquisition including a cost estimate tool
- Construction Management to include Earned Value Management Functionality
- Project management
- Developed and ad hoc reporting capability
- Ability to interface with Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) programs

The software shall facilitate the management of a divers real property portfolio comprised of approximately 17 million square feet of building space and thousands of acres of associated land dispersed over a large geographical area. Managed assets include CBP owned, direct leased, GSA leased, Inter-agency, and free-space facilities.  

The software must interface with the CBP enterprise system, SAP, on a real-time basis.  In addition, it shall be capable of interfacing with various agency developed Access type databases and support tools.  It must provide all connected systems and databases and provide users with a single Graphical User Interface (GUI) through which to retrieve or update data and perform various other project management functions

The system shall provide mapping and layering capabilities through the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).  The system shall have the capability of interfacing with the CBP enterprise system, SAP and providing usable imagery and data.  The GIS must be a function of the software or capable of interfacing with a third-party GIS software such as ArcGIS, to provide a visual (map and imagery) representation of real property assets.

The system shall be capable of interfacing with Mobile Technology Devices (i.e. automated data collection through use of Barcode Scanning and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and other wireless devices that track maintenance/repairs and reports results/inspections). 

The system must have a robust reporting tool that provides standard reports and functionality for ad hoc reporting.

The desire is to deploy a web-based capable system, but client-server architecture is acceptable. Regardless of the technology, the system shall accommodate 200 simultaneous users with the capability to expand.  If web-based, the system shall encrypt the data. 

Security:

The software shall provide system and user level security, based on defined roles. The security/job roles must be adaptable to SAP.  User level security capability must accommodate read-only and/or restricted access for external users of the system.  The system will adhere to provided standards and guidelines as defined by the CBP Office of Information Technology (OIT).  The system will reside on CBP network equipment following OIT testing, verification and validation its compatibility with other enterprise applications and systems.   
Data Auditing and Reporting
The software shall provide the capability to audit data records by recording the username that last modifies the record to include date and time of the update. This audit information must be available at the transaction level. In certain cases, it may be necessary to track the history of users and the associated date and timestamp fields rather than only providing information on the last update of the record.  In addition to tracking these items, the system shall provide the capability to generate reports of the audit information.  
Automated Electronic Mail Notification
The software must have incorporated or developed functions that interface with CBPs electronic mail (e-mail) servers to provide automated notifications to appropriate users when a triggering event occurs. Capability to work with the SAP Workflow process may be required.  Implementation of this functionality will require creation and definition of an organizational structure so that relevant users can be identified, and coordination with OIT to set up an interface with the applicable electronic mail servers.  

Transparency and Ease of Use:

The software shall allow users seamless access to information. As part of its usability, the system will clearly delineate the mandatory and optional fields, possible data self - population, enable easy navigation between screens, and quick access to information. The end-state system will provide transparency of all processes to users and will store all project-related data.  It will have a centralized repository where Project Manager (PM) and other key players in the project can enter and if their roles require, update information. This will enable all information to be captured and accessed by users. The system will provide transparency about the project funding status to field personnel. It will also provide PMs with real-time project data through dynamic reports. The system will contain up-to-date Point of Contact (POC) information for facilities. The system will make transparent the Notice to Proceed (NTP) process of a project to field personnel, and clearly show the project life cycle so that key players will always have a current status update of the project. 

Link to the Knowledge Management System:

FM&E implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS) in July 2008 as a collaborative intranet website to enable dissemination of organizational news and bulletins, to allow employees to share ideas, and to aid storage and access of shared documents.  Several documents stored on KMS are related to the functions performed within the proposed system.  To prevent duplication of documents and redundancy of storage space on the CBP network, the proposed system shall provide links to appropriate documents in KMS.  These links will be established as hyperlink items within the proposed system and shall enable users to access documents on KMS without exiting or logging off the FMS.  

RFI Information:

<a href="mailto:HQ-SSP_RFI@mail.nasa.gov">Richard A Wickman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA nor the Government will beresponsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.NASA recognizes the interest by educational institutions, science museums, and otherappropriate organizations in the acquisition of NASA Shuttle-related property followingthe last flight of the Space Shuttle.  While NASAs priority is flying the remainingShuttle missions safely, because of the quantity, complexity, and dispersion of the SpaceShuttle Program (SSP) assets, successful Space Shuttle transition and retirement requirescareful planning prior to program completion, currently scheduled for September 2010.  This RFI is being used to gather market research for NASA to make decisions regardingdevelopment of strategies for placement of Space Shuttle Orbiters and Space Shuttle MainEngines (SSMEs) for public display after conclusion of the SSP.  NASA is seekinginformation from educational institutions, science museums, and other appropriateorganizations about the communitys ability to acquire and display a Space ShuttleOrbiter after the vehicles are retired from flight status.  NASA is interested in identifying whether potential recipient organizations are capableof bearing the full cost of Space Shuttle Orbiter safing and final display preparation,SSME assembly and final display preparation, and transportation.  Orbiter safing includesitems such as decontamination of hypergolic fuel systems and removal of other safety andenvironmental hazards from the vehicles.  Organizations interested in receiving a SpaceShuttle Orbiter for public display must be prepared to raise sufficient funding for SpaceShuttle Orbiter safing, final display preparation, and transportation services. Organizations interested in receiving a SSME for public display must be prepared to raisesufficient funding for SSME final display preparation and transportation services.Organizations seeking an SSME may either independently contract and pay for engineassembly and display services, or accept the SSME as disassembled components for assemblyby in-house staff.  Organizations that ultimately receive an Orbiter or SSME will beresponsible for all costs.NASA will use the results of this RFI to determine interest that may lead to selection ofspecific organizations to receive a Space Shuttle Orbiter or SSME.  The Orbiters andSSMEs may be directly transferred or donated to eligible recipient organizations underthe authority provided by 40 U.S.C. 529.Background:NASA will cease SSP operations at all locations following completion of the last flight,currently scheduled to occur no later than September 30, 2010.	The Government may electto change the scheduled date for last flight.  SSP retirement necessitates thedisposition of all SSP assets and items no longer required by NASA, including the SpaceShuttle Orbiters and SSMEs.  Disposition of SSP property will be accomplished accordingto existing government policy and guidelines developed and managed by the GeneralServices Administration (GSA). The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-422) directs NASA to submit to Congress aplan describing the process for the disposition of the remaining Orbiters and other SpaceShuttle program-related hardware after the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet.  NASAadvised the Congress that it would begin discussions with the Smithsonian Institution,National Air and Space Museum regarding accession of a flown Space Shuttle Orbiter to thenational collection.  The National Air and Space Museum houses the national collection ofaerospace artifacts.  NASA also advised the Congress that the Agency would issue an RFIto gauge the level and scope of interest of U.S. organizations in acquiring the two (2)other Orbiters and other major flight hardware (such as the SSMEs) for public displayonce NASAs programmatic requirements for the assets have been satisfied.   P.L. 110-422 further directs NASA to terminate or suspend any activity of the Agencythat, if continued between the date of enactment of this Act and April 30, 2009, wouldpreclude the continued safe and effective flight of the Space Shuttle after fiscal year2010 if the President inaugurated on January 20, 2009, were to make a determination todelay the Space Shuttles scheduled retirement.  NASA is issuing this RFI solely forplanning purposes in order to give interested recipients time to make their interest inacquiring Space Shuttle Orbiters and/or SSMEs known and begin planning for thateventuality.   SSP Hardware Addressed in this RFI:Space Shuttle OrbitersNASAs Space Shuttle Orbiters (Figure 1) are the first reusable spacecraft capable ofroutinely launching into orbit like rockets and then returning to Earth as gliders. These unique crew and heavy cargo-carrying vehicles are the main element of the NationalSpace Transportation System that has been the mainstay of the U.S. human spaceflightprogram for more than a quarter-century.  The Space Shuttle Orbiters have and continue toperform a wide variety of scientific research and space operations missions, includingthe final assembly of the International Space Station.	Due to the significance of the Space Shuttle Orbiters and the role they have played inthe Nations space program, special attention will be paid to ensuring they will retireto appropriate places.	NASA is keenly aware of the essential value of these key assetsto the space programs rich history; the Agency is therefore committed to makingplacement decisions that are determined to be in the best interest of the Americantaxpayer.NASAs current plan is to transfer one flown Orbiter to the National Air and SpaceMuseum.  The remaining two flown Orbiters would be placed in storage at the John F.Kennedy Space Center until final placement decisions are made.	The Orbiters would beavailable for donation no earlier than September 30, 2011.  NASA desires to ferry theOrbiters to their final destinations no later than May 31, 2012.  Assembled SSMEs willnot be installed in, nor included with, the Orbiters.NASA estimates the total cost to be incurred by a recipient organization for safing oneOrbiter, preparing it for final display, and delivery by ferry flight to a U.S.destination airport at approximately $42 million.  This $42 million estimate includes a$6 million cost to air ferry the Orbiter by Shuttle Carrier Aircraft from the KennedySpace Center to a U. S. destination airport. This early estimate is based on specificassumptions by NASA about the minimum tasks which must be performed for public display ofa Space Shuttle Orbiter.  The estimate is subject to change.  It does not take intoaccount special measures that may be required in specific situations such as transportingthe Orbiter long distances over public roadways which may require removal of light postsand traffic signals or transport by barge over water.  Additional preparation tasks suchas fabrication of engine bay covers or mock nozzles, open payload bay door displayconfiguration, and lighting on the vehicle would also increase costs to recipients.  TheOrbiters will not be disassembled for transportation or storage.Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs)The SSMEs (Figure 2) are the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engines located at the aft endof the Space Shuttle Orbiter.  These unique, reusable power plants provide propulsionduring the ascent of the Space Shuttle, with each engine generating 490,800 lbs. ofthrust.  Overall, each SSME weighs approximately 7,800 lbs.  Current planning calls for the SSMEs to be retired along with the Space Shuttle fleet. In the immediate future, however, NASA will retain flight-worthy engines for technicalmitigation and potential programmatic reuse within NASA or the Department of Defenseuntil final disposition decisions are made.  At least six (6), but potentially as many asten (10), non-flight-worthy unassembled or partially assembled but largely complete SSMEswill be available for donation as early as mid-2009.  Current, obsolete, and scrapcomponents would be brought together by NASA into unassembled or partially assembleddisplay engine kits.	Depending on availability of engine components, some kits mayrequire mock components to make a complete engine display.  Recipient organizations wouldbe responsible for transporting, assembling and preparing the engines kits for displayusing in-house staff or through separate agreements with aerospace contractors.  Thetotal estimated cost to be incurred by a recipient organization for assembling a completeSSME for static display is in the range of $400,000  $800,000, exclusive of shippingcosts.	Shipping costs will be borne by the recipient organization.  The estimate issubject to change.  Assembly costs will vary based on the existing state of assembly ofeach engine kit, the level of fidelity desired for the final display item, and othervariables.  Additional preparation tasks such as fabrication of display stands or mockengine components would also increase costs to recipients.  Special Considerations:It should be noted that the organizations that ultimately receive a Space Shuttle Orbiteror SSME hardware must abide by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)restrictions placed on the items. The Orbiters and SSMEs fall under the purview of theU.S. Munitions List (USML), as defined in the ITAR (22 CFR120-130) and are exportcontrolled.  The Space Shuttle Orbiters and SSMEs shall not be transferred to foreignpersons (ITAR 120.16), in the U.S. or abroad, or exported out of the U.S., withoutnotification to NASA and the specific approval/export license from the Department ofState Directorate for Defense Trade Controls (http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/    ).Violations of these regulations are punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. As noted above, NASA plans to initially retain flight-worthy SSMEs for technicalmitigation and potential programmatic reuse.  The Space Shuttle Orbiters that would beavailable for donation after the end of the program would be offered without flightSSMEs.Air ferry of Orbiters by Shuttle Carrier Aircraft would require U. S. destinationairports to have 8,000 to 10,000 feet runways depending on the altitude and atmospherictemperature of the landing site, and the final weight of the Orbiters being delivered.	The Space Shuttle Orbiters and SSMEs may not be displayed outdoors.  Responders should beaware that the Orbiters and SSMEs will require suitable climate-controlled indoor displayspace. Responders should take into consideration that the Orbiters and SSMEs may containhazardous materials and require proper handling.  Although NASA will take necessaryprecautions to decontaminate the hardware and remove or render safe known safety andenvironmental hazards, it may not be possible to completely remove all residual hazardsfrom the hardware.  NASA will clearly identify any unusual hazards that are not removed,prior to transferring the hardware to final recipient organizations.There is a limited quantity of support items and tools that may be necessary totransport, assemble, and display the Space Shuttle Orbiters and/or SSMEs.  NASA intendsto loan available support items to the organizations receiving the hardware, however thisrequirement may be waived at NASA's discretion based on government needs and requirementsat the time the hardware is transferred.  Loan of support items and tools would benegotiated with the recipient organizations.

<a href="mailto:norman.bonano@us.army.mil">Norman Bonano</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Joint Munitions & Lethality Acquisition Center is seeking proven developers and manufacturers with extensive experience and facilities in place to upgrade the current configuration of the M4 Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM) to its improved version, the M4E1 SLAM and to produce the M320E1 SLAM Improved Functional Trainer (SIFT).  
The M4E1 SLAM is a multipurpose, one-shot, anti-materiel/demolition device, compact, lightweight munition with antidisturbance and self-destruct features.  The M4E1 SLAM operates in four (4) different modes: Bottom Attack (Magnetic), Side-Attack (Passive Infrared), Time Demolition, and Command Detonation (Blasting Cap).  The M4E1 SLAM is designed to be readily portable and hand-emplaced against lightly armored infantry vehicles, parked aircraft, wheeled or tracked support vehicles, and ammunition or Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication (POL) storage sites.  It is estimated that approximately 11,049 M4 SLAMs will be upgraded.  The M4E1 SLAM includes magnetic and Passive Infrared sensors, munition controls, electronic packaging, and an EFP (Explosively Formed Penetrator) warhead.  This effort will require 36 months to complete, however the first 1,296 M4E1 should be completed within 20 months with all work to include removing the warhead assemblies from the Government owned M4 munitions that are currently in Army inventory, CONUS, OCONUS, and preposition location (Prepo Ship); fabricating, validate, & test the M4E1 Base and Cover (B&C) Assemblies and associated Reusable Environmental Protective Package (REPP); fabricate, validate, & test the B&C Assemblies and Safe and Arming (S&A) assembly; installing the removed M4 warheads onto the B&C Assemblies; fabricate, validate, & test the integrity of the explosive firing train; and proving that the M4E1 munitions meet the four functional modes.

The M320E1 SLAM Improved Functional Trainer (SIFT) is a compact, lightweight interactive trainer with an antidisturbance feature.  The M320E1 SIFT replicates the same size and shape as the SLAM M4E1. This M320E1 SIFT is totally inert and is powered to provide feedback to the user and trainees through the use of two Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights and a buzzer.  The LED light conditions whether flashing or color, or internal buzzer indicate current M320E1 SLAM status, errors or detonation.  The device has the same sensor and timing functionality as the tactical M4E1 SLAM. The controls, functions, and external interfaces of the SIFT trainer are identical to the M4E1 SLAM except for the warhead and explosive firing train. Approximately 300 M320E1 Kits (1,200 M320E1 SIFTS total) will be procured for training.  These units will not be a recap effort but new production.

Capability must include experience and facilities for development, laboratory and field-testing, including infrared and magnetic signature testing, and fabrication of the electronic and mechanical assemblies similar to the M4E1 SLAM.  The possible prime contractor must show the capability and past experience working with sensor technology, electronic circuitry, crystals, and fuzing technology similar to the M4 and M4E1 SLAM.  The offeror must have facilities to store the High Explosive (HE) explosive.  Some of the information related to the infrared and magnetic sensors is classified Secret.  Therefore the offeror must provide evidence that they have necessary facilities to store secret information and key individuals must possess Secret security clearance.  Respondents should also address their ability to perform prototype development and fabrication, failure analyses and corrective actions of electronic and mechanical assemblies containing explosives, manufacturing and assembly operations; quality control, storage on components, assemblies and explosives; to perform Load Assemble and Pack (LAP) operations; minimum/maximum production quantities; and ability to create precision EFP liners.  Provide descriptive literature to substantiate your ability to meet all of the above requirements.  Information being submitted should include your organization name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities, facilities, successful experience in developing, testing and producing munitions, inspection capability, size standard, and provide cage code of your facility.  The current M4 SLAM was developed by Alliant Techsystems, LLC and then subsequently produced by Alliant Precision Fuze Company, LLC.  All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 5 January 2009 to JM&L LCMC, ATTN: AMSCC-JML-CC, Bldg. 9, Norman Bonano, Contract Specialist, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.  Responses can also be submitted by email to norman.bonano@us.army.mil.  It should be noted that telephone replies will not be accepted.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government and will be held in confidential status.  The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS.<BR> <BR>This is a Request for Information ONLY.   <BR> <BR>DESCRIPTION. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District (USACE) is seeking industry feedback from small business contractors on current and future renewable thermal energy generated roofing.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on competition for Solar Thermal Tile-Air Heating for Roofing. <BR> <BR>NOTICE. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not reimburse for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued. <BR> <BR>BACKGROUND. The Adelphi Laboratory Center (ALC) working in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District is researching the replacement of their 80,373 total square feet of deteriorated roofs with Solar Thermal Tile Air-heating Roof Systems, which embraces solar/renewable energy technology. The installation is seeking to meet its energy reduction goal as well as its goal to reduce energy costs, in addition to participating in the endeavor to reduce greenhouse gases throughout the nation. <BR> The integration of the solar energy collection systems into the building and mechanical systems should reduce energy consumption at a minimum of 3% annually. The goal is to attain a solar roofing system that will perform the function of a roof while it collects solar energy. The roof should keep precipitation out of the building, resist wind and weight of snow, sleet and ice, and also form a thermal and vapor boundary to keep the building beneath it warm or cold, humid or dry. The solar <BR>energy captured from the sunlight falling on the building should be able to use in space heating and hot water heating. The solar roofing system should deliver different levels of thermal energy to match the varying needs of each facility.  <BR> <BR>INFORMATION REQUEST. The Adelphi Laboratory Center working in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District is requesting information on solar energy collection systems that can exhibit capabilities of designing and installing a solar energy collection system. The Government is interested in currently available solar roofing systems that meet or exceed these capabilities and/or planned solar roofingsystems that meet or exceed these capabilities. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information with a cover letter containing points of contacts (POCs). <BR> <BR>1. Demonstrate that your Solar Roofing System will be able to replace approximately 80,373 total square feet of deteriorated roofs on multiple buildings at the Adelphi Laboratory Center, Adelphi, Maryland. <BR> <BR>2. Demonstrate that the Solar Roofing System will be a solar thermal air exchange-heating roof system able to utilize solar/renewable energy technology. <BR>    <BR>3. Demonstrate that the proposed Solar Roofing System will reduce energy consumption at the ALC by providing typical annual savings experienced (for typical heating season of October through April) through implementation of renewable thermal energy product installation and evaluation. <BR>     <BR>4. Demonstrate that the Solar Roofing System will have a service life of at a minimum of 40 years. <BR>    <BR>5. Demonstrate that the Solar Roofing System will perform the function of a roof while it collects solar energy (i.e. it will keep precipitation out of the building, resist wind and weight of snow, sleet and ice, and also form a thermal and vapor boundary to keep the building beneath it warm or cold, humidor dry). <BR>6. Demonstrate that the Solar Roofing System that the solar energy captured from the sunlight falling on the building will be used in space heating and hot water heating. <BR>     <BR>7. Demonstrate that the Solar Roofing System will deliver different levels of thermal energy to match the varying needs of each facility. <BR> <BR>The Government recognizes that vendors can provide other pertinent information to distinguish their products, and are encouraged to do so. For example, minimum reduction of energy consumption of 3% is considered necessary for ALC goals, there maybe technologies that can meet or exceed this desired result in a more efficient and effective manner. <BR><BR>Interested parties are requested to submit capability statements, product information, technical approach and statement certifying small business status no later than 15 January 2009 to 10 S. Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, Room 7000, C/O Sarika N. McCoy, Contract Specialist. Submissions shall not exceed (10) pages (11 font minimum).

The Government would anticipate potential contractors would conduct market research with companies in the oil and gas industry and/or Government agencies that have similar operations to ascertain how they are operated.
2.  Is the Government going to develop requirements or a business model which would then be used to evaluate against commercial best practices?  Would this business model then be used in order to establish what MRM would be measured against?   Not necessarily, but the Government would not rule this out at this time.  One of the goals of this effort is to have recommendations on how the organization may be improved to be more effective and efficient.
3.  Regarding Section 2, Technical Description, b. Second bulleted paragraph:  Strong quantitative and modeling capabilities; ideally the successful offeror will have practical experience developing risk modeling tools...  What specific type of risk modeling will be required?  This reference refers to risk reporting tools and it is up to the respondents to the solicitation to determine what information should be included to respond to these evaluation factors.
4.  How much time does MMS anticipate allowing between letting the contract and the due date for the Draft Project Plan?  The exact time frame has not been defined however, the Government anticipates the Draft Plan to be submitted within 5-10 days from receipt of the notice to proceed.
5.  Is the Past Performance requirement counted as part of the Technical Description requirement limitation of 20-pages?  No.

<DESC>The purpose of this sole source performance based contract is to support the mission of the Office of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality

All Payer Claims Databases (APCDs) are being established in multiple states, bringing together health care claims from all settings of care (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, dental) for all payers, or insurers, in a state.  APCDs have the potential to provide a unique source of information on costs and quality of care across the continuum of health services.  With the spread of APCDs across more states, it has become apparent that standardization of the data systems, formats, data elements, and coding is imperative.  Standardization will help to reduce costs of data submission for payers who must submit data to multiple data systems, facilitate cross-state sharing of data, enable multi-state research and analyses, and encourage the development of tools and measures for use with APCDs.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energys physical security needs, is seeking one or more business partners in the medical diagnostics field, including but not limited to glucose detection, to develop Sandias microneedle technology.  Sandia is seeking a company or companies to commercially license the technology described in this posting, and expects the successful company(ies) to engage in the creation of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Sandia to further develop the technology.  Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to obtain a license to the intellectual properties for reasonable compensation.  It is expected that the company(ies) that works with Sandia to develop the microneedle technology will promptly incorporate it into a commercial product.  

Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional diagnostics systems.  

The subject technology is a platform of multiple microneedles, capable of painlessly passing into a patients skin and accessing interstitial fluid.  In one embodiment, the microneedles are configured as individually addressable microelectrodes and various analytes are detected in vivo via electrochemical methods, allowing analytes possessing redox behaviors to be easily detected in real-time without pain to the patient.  In another embodiment, various analytes are chemically bound to the microneedles, removed from the patient, and detected via methods such as optical and chemical techniques.  To date, Sandia has demonstrated glucose detection with this technology.   

To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Daisy Segura by 23 January 2009 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115, Fax (505) 844-8011, E-mail: dsegura@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.

<DESC><p>This is a Notice of Intent to Award a delivery order for Medical Logistics Support Services utilizing an IDIQ contract established from the Veteran's Administration Department, contract #VA798-P-0002.&nbsp; Based on current contract, it is in the best interest of the government not to change the contract vendor.&nbsp; If we do not utilize the current IDIQ contract, we can lose access to the viable medical programs, pricing, terms, and conditions.&nbsp; It will cost the government a vast amount of time and effort to change vendors.&nbsp; Since the VA contract has been competed and awarded, this is the best route for the government to take.</p>
<p>Due to cost effectiveness, we will award to the current contractor from 1 Jan 2009 - 31 December 2012.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-052-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services from Transoma Medical Inc/DSI 119 - 14th Street N.W., St. Paul, MN., 55112 following:

Electrocardiogram Analysis Software Module, Part #PNM-ECG1W, Model # Analysis Module (ECG), quantity one (1) each. 10. Dell Computer - Windows XP Optiplex Minitower Core 2 Duo Core 2 Duo processor (minimum 2.66 GHz) 4 GB RAM 250 GB Hard Drive DVD RW Drive includes software installation and test when purchase with DSI acquisition system, Part #270-0112-005 Model Computer, quantity one(1) each.  11.  Dell 19" computer monitor max screen resolution 1280 x 1024, Part #271-0113-001, Model #Computer monitor 19", quantity one (1) each.  12. Post Acquisition Analysis Software. Required for Post Acquisition on remote computer, Part # PNM=P3P-POST, Model #Post Analysis, Software, quantity one (1) each.  13.  ECG Pattern Recognition Option (Existing Acquisition and Post Systems), Part # PNM-010-TMPLTE, Model #Analysis Module (ECG PRO), quantity one (1) each.

The purchase shall include free technical support during business days of DSI via the phone, fax, or e-mail.  Business our are Monday - Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm CST. USA time.

The warranty shall be effective from the data product is shipped to the customer and installed, and shall continue for:

12 months for data acquisition hardware and telemetry receivers
12 months for cables supplied separately or as part of a product
24 months for new and exchanged transmitters except 12 months for new or exchanged F20-EET or F40-EET
Shall include the duration of warranted battery life for the transmitters performance specifications 
12 months for magnetic media

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the newly formed NHLBI Murine Phenotyping Core needs the above equipment in order to service investigators as a functional murine phenotyping laboratory.  The transmitters are for use with the Laboratorys current owned and operated DSI system. The system must be compatible with the existing system and software. 

DSI telemetry training system: The Laboratorys current DSI system can support obtaining chronic heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, activity, and core temperature monitoring for up to 12 mice at a time.  This system is in constant use by investigators, and there has not been an unscheduled week available to use this system for months, and it is expected to be in constant use and booked for many months into the unforeseeable future.  The laboratory needs a second, smaller system in order for investigators to collect baseline data on all the parameters for the most commonly used background strains.  This data will help in analyzing experimental data obtained from the main system.  For this data to be relevant and meaningful for that purpose it must be obtained by the same technology, methodologies, and procedures as the experimental data which justifies buying a DSI system.  The Government also need this system to conduct independent research projects, and will also use it to train investigators how to use the software and conduct experiments on the equipment prior to them using the main system.  The DSI telemetry system is the only one available for chronic monitoring of murine direct arterial blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, activity, core temperature because it is currently under a patent.  All studies in the literature involving telemetric monitoring of these parameters in mice are obtained using the DSI system.  Also, as mentioned above, data obtained from this system will be used as baselines which will be used to help analyze experimental data obtained on the main system, which can only be done if the data were obtained comparably, i.e. from the same system.  DSI is the only company that currently provides this technology for mice.

Ponemah post analysis software by DSI.  Currently, analysis and manipulation of data obtained by the DSI mouse telemetry system can not be done during the experiment and it can only be accessed by a single user and a single site.  This creates a problem because the system is in high demand and constantly in use, and currently after an experiment is finished the investigators must sit in the animal room for several days to access and analyze their data before the next investigator can start their study.  This software is required for post acquisition analysis on a remote computer, and will also let researchers have the ability to access data on their own computers providing independence from the DSI systems experimental schedule.  With this software the core will be able to support more users and experiments with the DSI system.
This is the only product that allows for more than one user to analyze DSI data and to analyze DSI data on an offsite computer because the DSI software is owned by DSI, its protected software, and to allow for the above capabilities it must be done through buying this DSI owned and DSI compatible software program.  Basically, only other DSI software is compatible with the current DSI software.
  
DSI ECG analysis software.  The phenotyping core is currently involved in collecting ECG data in transgenic mice to support NHLBI investigators.  This software will improve our abilities to detect subtle ECG changes associated with a transgenic strains obtained from the DSI telemetry system and strengthen our data analysis capacities.  Only other DSI software is compatible with the current DSI software.

The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Architect-Engineer (A/E) services are required for up to 4 Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm fixed-price contracts to primarily support Civil Works projects, US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Projects for the San Francisco District (SPN) and secondarily  support Military projects within the footprint of the South Pacific Division (SPD). <BR>The concentration of work will be within the San Francisco Districts civil works boundaries in the states of California and parts of Oregon.<BR>This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  A-E services are required primarily to support the in-house design resources for civil works, VA and military projects that require a design that results in Plans and Specifications and detailed Estimates for a Construction Project, Planning/Feasibility study or pre-design documentations, however, should the need arise and the in-house resources are totally committed, the services may include the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete projects. Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Divisions civil works boundaries of the San Francisco District.  The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility which can include work within CA, NV, AZ and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY. <BR><BR>The North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS) is 541310, which has a small business size standard of maximum $4.0 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years.  More than one firm will be selected from this announcement and it is anticipated that up to four contracts will be awarded. One of these contracts will be set aside for the highest qualified small business. The remaining contracts shall be awarded to firms regardless of size and based on the qualification rankings. These resulting Firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts will be negotiated and the first is anticipated to be awarded in April 2009 or earlier.  Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500.  (2) In making selection of the awardees to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order.  All contracts awarded from this solicitation must be awarded no later than one year from the date that the responses to this synopsis are due.

Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option periods may be exercised early if the annual Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  All pricing schedules (for base year, and option periods) will be effective for one full year, regardless of the early exercising of options, beginning with the date of award of the base year.  The pricing schedules for the first, second, third, and fourth option periods become effective on the 1st,2nd, 3rd, and 4th anniversary dates, respectively, of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year's 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised.  Task Orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size.

<DESC><p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located on the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD intends to issue a requirement for an isohermal titration calorimeter.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number, HU0001-09-Q-0700, is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). It will be the responsibility of the Contractor to monitor Federal Business Opportunities, http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ for the issuance of any changes/updates to the solicitation. This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation and incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-29. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Size: 500 employees.</p>
<p>Direct any communications, questions or inquiries in writing to Kali Shelton, Contract Specialist, at Directorate of Contracting, Rm A1040C, USUHS, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 or via email to kshelton@usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>Quote Format:</p>
<p>CLIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description<br />0001 Isothermal titration calorimeter (Qty of 1): $ ____ each</p>
<p>Delivery and Acceptance Location, and FOB Point, Destination:</p>
<p>Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences<br />4301 Jones Bridge Road, Loading Dock<br />Bethesda, MD 20814-4799</p>
<p>Description of Use:<br />The isothermal titration calorimeter will be used to directly measure heat evolved or absorbed in liquid samples normally as a result of injecting precise amounts of reactants. The sample and a buffer reference solution are enclosed in an adiabatic jacket. During an experiment the reference cell is heated by a very small constant power, the reference offset. The temperature difference between the two cells is constantly measured and a proportional power is increased or reduced to the sample cell by the cell feedback system to keep the temperature difference very small. A signal proportional to that cell feedback power is called CFB, and with the instrument temperature and time, constitutes the instrument's relevant raw data.</p>
<p>Specific and immediate applications of the isothermal titration calorimetry:<br />I. Characterize the molecular interactions proposed to use ITC to fully characterize the thermodynamics of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that are implicated in the biological function of various biomolecules. In particular, interactions mediated by virion infectivity factor (Vif), which include those with RNA and cellular proteins.</p>
<p>II. To quantify the binding of substrates for substrate binding characteristics.</p>
<p>Minimum Specifications:</p>
<p>For biological applications where volume and concentration are limited, we require an instrument with superior sensitivity and minimal sample requirements. Specifically, a system capable of handling 40 &micro;L or less of titrant and the capability of delivering injection volumes as low as 0.1 uL is required. Due to large numbers of samples, we also require the ability to upgrade to an automated system than can handle 100-200 samples a day. Since our users will have varied backgrounds in data fitting, we also require data analysis software allowing for selectable binding models, automated calibration procedures and standardized calibration report generators.</p>
<p>***No refurbished parts***</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors: <br />The government will award a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the government; prices and other factors considered, e.g. quality and delivery schedule.

Oral quotes in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile quotes, quotes may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile quotes.

(To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) N/A<br />(ii) N/A<br />(iii) N/A<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number.

The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) N/A<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $180.8 million in humanitarian assistance programs addressing needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and other vulnerable or drought-affected rural populations.  Funded activities have included the provision of emergency relief supplies; support for food and agricultural needs; improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure; improved coordination and information sharing among humanitarian agencies; and the establishment of livelihoods opportunities and income generation projects.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, USAID/OFDA supported three emergency assistance programs, valued at nearly $17 million, including urban shelter and settlements activities in Kabul, emergency winter assistance to vulnerable Afghans, and support for increased production of certified seed.  

According to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), most of the estimated 1.2 million IDPs displaced under the Taliban regime, have returned home.  As of early 2007, UNHCR estimated the protracted IDP caseload at 130,000 people, displaced due to insecurity, drought, landlessness, and tribal conflict.  An estimated 29,000 people were displaced during 2007, primarily from Kandahar, Helmand, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces in the south and Heart and Badghis provinces in the west.  No precise tallies of the number of current IDPs exist.  Although displacements often occur following outbreaks of fighting, UNHCR noted that most IDPs displaced by fighting return to areas of origin once the situation stabilizes.  Approximately 21 percent of all IDPs and refugee returnees to Afghanistan since 2002more than one of every fivehave moved to two of Afghanistans 398 provincial districts: Kabul and Bagrami districts in Kabul Province, which are located within Kabul Municipality (KM).  An additional 14 percent of all returning refugees have moved to other districts of Kabul Province since 2002, including portions of KM.

OBJECTIVE

The Europe, Middle East and Central Asia regional team (EMCA) requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, and, subject to U.S. security considerations, willing to travel within and outside of Afghanistan on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (U.N.) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAIDs Regional Missions, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other USAID-funded programs.   This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA), U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), as well as with relevant U.N. agencies and NGOs, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working under the guidance of USAID/Afghanistan and the additional guidance and supervision of the Regional Coordinator for EMCA at OFDA/Washington, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDAs programs in Afghanistan.  
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as the U.N. and NGO agencies working in Afghanistan.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOA activities on humanitarian programs; 
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and  
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and U.N. agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to  OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with U.N., NGOs, IOs, the GOA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Regional Coordinator for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Washington.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the EMCA Regional Coordinator.   

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The EMCA Regional Advisor, presently based in Washington, D.C., will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds) as well as wearing of protective gear.  OFDA staff serving in Afghanistan are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool. Walking and jogging within the compound is also an option.

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Most work activities take place in an office setting, although a fair amount of work can take place outside of the office, including visits to counterpart offices and project sites in Kabul, trips to various governorates, as allowed by security, and/or travel to Washington, D.C., for consultation and meetings with USG and partners.  During site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 22 December 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 21 December 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-334-5220. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $180.8 million in humanitarian assistance programs addressing needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and other vulnerable or drought-affected rural populations.  Funded activities have included the provision of emergency relief supplies; support for food and agricultural needs; improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure; improved coordination and information sharing among humanitarian agencies; and the establishment of livelihoods opportunities and income generation projects.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, USAID/OFDA supported three emergency assistance programs, valued at nearly $17 million, including urban shelter and settlements activities in Kabul, emergency winter assistance to vulnerable Afghans, and support for increased production of certified seed.  

According to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), most of the estimated 1.2 million IDPs displaced under the Taliban regime, have returned home.  As of early 2007, UNHCR estimated the protracted IDP caseload at 130,000 people, displaced due to insecurity, drought, landlessness, and tribal conflict.  An estimated 29,000 people were displaced during 2007, primarily from Kandahar, Helmand, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces in the south and Heart and Badghis provinces in the west.  No precise tallies of the number of current IDPs exist.  Although displacements often occur following outbreaks of fighting, UNHCR noted that most IDPs displaced by fighting return to areas of origin once the situation stabilizes.  Approximately 21 percent of all IDPs and refugee returnees to Afghanistan since 2002more than one of every fivehave moved to two of Afghanistans 398 provincial districts: Kabul and Bagrami districts in Kabul Province, which are located within Kabul Municipality (KM).  An additional 14 percent of all returning refugees have moved to other districts of Kabul Province since 2002, including portions of KM.

OBJECTIVE

The Europe, Middle East and Central Asia regional team (EMCA) requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, and, subject to U.S. security considerations, willing to travel within and outside of Afghanistan on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (U.N.) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAIDs Regional Missions, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other USAID-funded programs.   This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA), U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), as well as with relevant U.N. agencies and NGOs, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working under the guidance of USAID/Afghanistan and the additional guidance and supervision of the Regional Coordinator for EMCA at OFDA/Washington, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDAs programs in Afghanistan.  
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as the U.N. and NGO agencies working in Afghanistan.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOA activities on humanitarian programs; 
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and  
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and U.N. agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to  OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with U.N., NGOs, IOs, the GOA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Regional Coordinator for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Washington.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the EMCA Regional Coordinator.   

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The EMCA Regional Advisor, presently based in Washington, D.C., will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds) as well as wearing of protective gear.  OFDA staff serving in Afghanistan are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

The unique nature of the Transition Initiatives (TI) program poses unique challenges for the recruitment, training and retention of staff.  OTI operates outside the development-mold, working with countries in post-conflict transition toward the social and political stability essential for the successful implementation of development activities.  Many of the Agencys development-oriented training programs are not well-suited to providing the kinds of professional training needed in OTI.  The transitory nature of OTIs programs often result in recruitment of staff using a personal services contract (PSC) mechanism, bringing in staff who have never worked for the Federal government before.  Many of the Agencys administrative and operational training programs assume a level of exposure to, and knowledge of, government operations well above the level of many OTI recruits.  This situation compels OTI to develop and conduct more in-house training than is the norm in other Agency Bureaus.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The Training Specialist will assess OTIs training needs to identify where Agency, Federal, or commercial training is available to meet those needs, and to design and implement training programs where other sources are inadequate or unable to meet those needs.  Key training programs to be developed in-house are those involving activities and programs that are unique to OTI, such as staff orientation and specialized training for Program Managers, Country field staff, and regional team leaders.  The Training Advisor will collaborate with the OTI Program Office and the OTI Field Programs Division to ensure that training modules developed are responsive to staff needs, sensitive to the OTI culture, and updated on an ongoing basis to incorporate lessons learned from hands-on headquarters and field experience.

OBJECTIVE

To hire a Training Specialist to support OTI's training needs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Chief, Operations and Management Division or his/her designee, the Training Specialist will perform the following duties:

(1)  Design training sessions on activities specific to OTI, such as orientation and the performance of functions unique to OTI (program management as performed by Program Managers, field implementation as performed by Country Representatives and Deputy Country Representatives, program oversight as performed by Regional Team Leaders, etc.).  Training modules will be developed in close collaboration with targeted participants, their supervisors, and their managers.  Training modules will be reviewed frequently and updated to reflect lessons learned from hands-on headquarters and field experience.  Most of this training will be Washington-based, but some field training may be required (such as regional training for FSN staff).   Deliver OTI-specific training as required, to include scheduling sessions, providing logistical support, scheduling travel and transportation for trainers and participants, and coaching presenters when necessary or appropriate. 

(2)  Develop, coordinate and manage an OTI training plan, to include 

	overseeing the development of supervisor-approved individual development plans (IDPs) for all OTI employees, to be reviewed and updated annually by the employees and their supervisors;
	analyzing the training needs identified in the IDPs to identify appropriate approaches to meeting these needs;
	maintaining a database of training needed and completed for all employees, and providing a variety of database training reports to management when required;
	monitoring training opportunities offered by sources outside OTI, to identify opportunities for employee participation in external training programs;
	reviewing individual requests for training, to ensure that training resources are allocated equitably and in accordance with office training priorities; 
	ensuring that personnel files (both paper and electronic) include documentation of all training completed; and 
	keeping OTIs Senior Leadership Team informed on a regular basis concerning implementation and costs of the training program.

(3)  Serve as OTIs training expert by:

	advising individual employees, their supervisors, and office managers on all aspects of employee development; 
	monitoring Agency, Bureau and Office training policies and procedures to determine applicability to OTI; 
	developing and maintaining a library of training resources, job aids and on-line materials to enhance employee performance; and
	providing assistance in identifying external training-related resources, including facilitation services where requested;
	representing the Office by participating in Agency, Bureau, or other training coordination efforts as required by the supervisor.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Training Specialist will take direction from and will report to OTIs Chief of Operations and Management or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

During deployment to the field (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>The Spacelift Range Group (LRRG) Program Office will be holding an Industry Day on 23 December 2008 for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for the LRRG Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; widest industry participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712 (size standard 500). The Industry Day will be hosted by the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Bldg 272, Room C2-238, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback on the Government's draft acquisition documents for the LRRG SE&amp;I effort as part of the Government's ongoing market research. A draft RFP will be made available on or about 18 December 2008.</p>
<p>To aid in the development of a clear and effective RFP for the SE&amp;I contract, the LRRG Program Office is soliciting industry inputs on the following topics: 1) feedback on the Draft RFP, including the Performance Work Statement, Instructions to Offerors (Section L), incentive fee plan, contract deliverables and any other aspects of the documentation released; 2) Organizational Conflict of Interest issues; 3) feedback on the proposed 20% Tier 1 Small Business Subcontracting Goal; and 4) responses to the remainder of "Questions to Industry". A subset of the current program-developed copies of acquisition documents will be made available on the FEDBIZOPPS website under the title of LRRG SE&amp;I. Contractors shall document and submit all critical comments/input in writing, including recommended discussion questions and responses to the attached "Questions to Industry" by 1200 PST on 19 December 2008. Non-critical or general RFP document comments will be accepted through Industry Day. Discussion questions will be addressed through a formal Government-response posting on FEDBIZOPPS. All input shall be submitted to SMC/LRSW/PK (LRRG), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lin S. Jensen, Contracting Officer or via email to lin.jensen@losangeles.af.mil. Discussion questions must be marked appropriately; justification must be provided for any portion marked as proprietary or for other restrictions on their use.</p>
<p>All interested parties are invited to attend Industry Day on 23 December 2008 starting at 0800.&nbsp; The General Session will be from 0800-1000 where the Government team will present an LRRG program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system requirements, and the SE&amp;I contractor's required interaction with the other program elements. In the afternoon, LRRG will meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties. Please contact the Contracting Officer to arrange your one-on-one appointment. Following Industry Day, the collective non-proprietary questions and responses will be consolidated and posted to the FEDBIZOPPS website.</p>
<p>Seating is limited and registration is required for attendance. Please contact the Contracting Office to register and for information on the facility being used for discussions. Potential prime contractors will be limited to four (4) representatives and one (1) representative per potential subcontractor. For one-on-one discussions, the individual prime contractors or prime contractor teams will be limited to ten (10) representatives. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>For access to Los Angeles Air Force Base and LRRG Industry Day, all Visit Requests should be faxed to the Visitor Control fax at (310) 653-9554 by 19 December 2008. Requests should specify "Attn: 1Lt Brett Hadley, LRRG SE&amp;I Industry Day" and contain the following: Name/SSAN/DOB/POB/Citizenship/Clearance Level/Clearance Investigation Date/Clearance Granting Agency/Member's Company-Organizati89on/Meeting Subject/Meeting Location/ Visit Dates/LRSW Sponsor and Cage Code (for industry). All meetings will be held at the unclassified level.</p>
<p>Questions to Industry</p>
<p>1. Provide feedback on Section L/M.</p>
<p>2. Provide recommendations for Government insight into subcontractor execution and performance.</p>
<p>3. The concept for the potential contract is for the contractor to ensure the Government's functional, technical, and program baseline by producing and giving advice on Government referenced Architecture documents. Please identify the top three (3) risks associated with this concept.</p>
<p>4. Given the Incentive Plan and the requirements for the SE&amp;I contract, what would you recommend as an appropriate fee percentage for this contract? Can you suggest additional, alternative and/or better objective incentive events for this contract? Do you have any recommendations for better methods to incentivize performance using objective criteria?</p>
<p>5. What percentage of the entire requirement will be subcontracted? What percentage of the contracted work can be performed by small business (please provide a description of the work and the associated NAICS code)? What methodology was used to make the above determinations?</p>
<p>6. For the basic period of performance (POP) there are significant deliverables early in the POP. Please assess any risk in achieving the milestones.</p>

Synopsis:

This is a Request for Information (RFI).  Questions and supporting documentation are attached in the links provided.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.   This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  Any information provided in response to this market research will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather market research to determine an acquisition strategy for the forthcoming solicitation for the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor Program (Med/Surg PV).

Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is an agency of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLA provides supply support and logistics services to the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and several federal agencies.  The Medical Supplier Operations, a Directorate of DSCP, is in the process of planning for a follow-on Medical Surgical Prime Vendor indefinite quantity, long-term contract.  The estimated solicitation issue date is on or around April 2009.  The intended contract base period is anticipated to be 2 years with 3  two year option periods, although this is subject to change depending on market research.  

The Med/Surg PV Program has established three TRICARE Global regions (North, South, and West) that combine to provide routine ordering capability throughout the world.  Prime Vendor (PV) is the primary distribution channel (single distributor) for procurement and delivery of a full range of commercial medical/surgical supplies to a group of Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the geographical regions.  MTFs order directly through the Prime Vendor with next day delivery.  Each PV provides all medical surgical products for which it has been authorized as a distributor under a designated contracting instrument as authorized by DSCP Medical.  All items are brand name specific or generic commercial products that are identified by the manufacturers item descriptions and part number and conform to the manufacturers commercial specifications.  

Your responses to the questions are requested by close of business on January 17, 2009 and may be sent via mail or email.
