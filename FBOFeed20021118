Any firm that believes it can furnish the items described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.   All responses received on or before December 2, 2002, will be considered by the Government.

White.   Responses should include the firm's  business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: $18 million for NAICS Code 511210.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Gamma Titanium Aluminide (TiAL) plate with proprietary Gamma-Met-PX composition. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Schwartzkopf Technology Corporation who is the only known source who can meet Agency requirements.  Gamma-Met-PX is a proprietary composition of a gamma titanium aluminide (TiAL) alloy with significantly improved strength and ductility compared to other TiAL compositions.	The performance of the alloy will be evaluated under conditions representative of launch vehicle hot structure service environments.  This evaluation will aid in the design of highly-efficient hot structures.  It would take substantial time and money for another company to generate the same specific composition with the improved properties of these plates and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 27, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the repair services for 65 electronic circuit Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) with various estimated annual quantities to support the FAA FA9996 Second Generation VORTAC (2GVORTAC) Very High Frequency Omnirange (VOR) and Doppler VOR (DVOR) System/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)-Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN).  These services are only known to be available from THALES ATM, Inc., Shawnee, Kansas formerly Wilcox Electric Inc. (Wilcox).  The requirement includes a base contract year with provisions for four 1-year options.  <P> These LRUs are used in the VOR portion of the 2GVORTAC and were originally manufactured by Wilcox in the early 1980s.  The 2GVORTAC was a joint venture between Wilcox and International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT).  ITT was responsible for the design and repair of the 2VORTAC Distance Measuring Equipment/Tactical Air Navigation (DME/TACAN) portion of the 2GVORTAC.   <P> THALES ATM Inc., formerly Wilcox, is the original manufacturer and is the only known source of development, design, system engineering expertise and test data.  They designed and manufactured the system and have developed repair capability for VOR and DVOR LRUs.  They have developed automatic test capability that has increased the reliability and decreased the repair cycle of the VOR and DVOR LRUs supporting the system.  They have also developed automatic test capability on the HP 3065, which speeds the test and repair of the LRUs.   <P> THALES ATM Inc. is the only vendor known to have a test bed.  The FAA provides, as Government Furnished Property (GFP), circuit card assemblies in order to maintain their test bed.  However, the circuit card assemblies provided as GFP are not sufficient for a contractor to test the LRUs.  Although there are other companies that may be competent sources of repair for some of the circuitry used in the 2GVORTAC system, a vendor must have access to a test bed or test fixtures, which will be required in order to accomplish system testing.  The FAA does not have test bed or test fixtures to provide to a contractor as GFP. <P> Interested vendors that have 2GVORTAC repair capabilities and access to test fixtures or a test bed and technical data to confirm LRUs performance to original specifications should respond with their documentation (2 copies) to demonstrate their ability to the Contracting Officer, FAA, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, NAS Acquisition Contracting Team, AMQ-210, P.O. Box 25082, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., Oklahoma City, OK, 73125-4929.  Facsimile responses are not permitted.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, test bed facility, and copies of the test procedures, specifications and equipment listings applicable to the LRUs as well as access to replacement parts necessary to effect the repairs.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Any information received as a result of this market survey w! ill not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether an additional source may be approved for the repair of the LRUs.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal. <P>

<DESC>The Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team, Eglin AFB Florida, plans to contract on a sole source basis with Applied Data Trends, Inc. (ADT, Inc.), 290 Cochran Road, Huntsville AL 35824 to upgrade, modify, test and provide JCIET Tactical Office Software (TACO 5.+) and Virtual Data Recording System (VDRS) Graphic Information System (GIS) to support Roving Sands 2003 and other evaluations. ADT modified the U.S. Army Patriot Tactical Planner software and provided support services to the 1999, 2000 All Services Combat Identification Evaluation Team (ASCIET), and 2002 JCIET Evaluations.  These software modifications resulted in a JCIET version of the Tactical Office software (referred to in this document as JCIET TACO 5.+).  ADT will provide support to JCIET during participation in combat evaluations and training exercises, starting with Roving Sands 2003 at Fort Bliss, Texas.  Tasks during Roving Sands 2003 include:  1) Modify and upgrade the JCIET TACO 5.+  software. The upgraded JCIET TACO software to display the data forwarded by the VDRS, plus the VDRS must be demonstrated and tested no later than March 2003, to allow support for Roving Sands; 2) Capture real-time PATRIOT system data via the VDRS at one designated Information and Coordination Central (ICC) and forwarding on ADNET to remote locations;  3) Real-time display and recording, and post-mission replay of the following Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) inputs from multiple sources (DIS Version 6): a) Patriot data with proper identity reflected in track amplifications (Hostile, Friend, Unknown, Assumed friend, Neutral); b) Entity state PDUs (with damage states live [color icon IAW JCIET 2002 player list] and dead [recolor icon black], c) vehicle vectors, aiming direction, and appearance attributes); d) fire PDUs (with direction of fire); e) detonate PDUs; and f) Properly display JU (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System [JTIDS] Unit) reporting unit instead of Higher Echelon Unit (HEU) and local reporting source on locally displayed track symbol;  7) Perform final system interface testing with the JCIET ADNET (Debrief Network) to ensure proper operation and demonstrate all capabilities; 8) Set up the JCIET Tactical Office (5.+) workstations, and possibly the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) instrumentation suite, during spin-up week, connect to the ADNET, and provide services necessary for use of the government furnished workstations; and 9) Daily tasks during the evaluations will support real time mission monitor and control, generation and broadcast of DIS PDUs, Patriot data recording, data extraction and conversion, after-action replay (debriefings), and data archival.  
The various PDU sources may include EPLRS, Advanced Range Data System (ARDS), Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumentation System (DFIRST), Range Applications Joint Project Office (RAJPO), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), Commanders Tactical Terminal/Moving Target Indicator (CTT/MTI) and Link 16 Multi-tadil Display System (MTDS).  Presentation of the various PDU types will be in accordance with the Roving Sands 2003 player list provided by FORSCOM (United States Army Forces Command). A critical aspect of the JCIET evaluation participation depends upon the analysis of data from numerous combat systems using graphic displays generated by computer. JCIET intends to use the updated Tactical Office software (5.+) because it has retained the capability previously purchased for the past Evaluations.  ADT has the resources to provide support immediately, starting in January 2003, the necessary displays and the associated technical services to support JCIET during Roving Sands 2003. ADT is the only qualified source to perform this effort.  ADT is uniquely capable of performing this task since they developed and modified the JCIET unique software utilized for this effort and have supported previous JCIET Evaluations. Planning for each evaluation will normally start two years prior to the event, based on this, JCIET is planning on a three-year contract (first year basic with two one-year options). The anticipated contract type is Time and Material (T&M) contract.  Information associated with this effort is classified up to, and including, SECRET.  Direct any questions concerning this effort to Ms Jewel Burgess, Contract Specialist, (850) 882-4141, Ext 4551 and Mr. Joe Gordon, Program Manager, (850) 882-6700, Ext 7020, for technical matters.  Contract award is planned for no later than January 2003.  NOTE 22 APPLIES.

It is anticipated that contact award shall take place in or around November 2003.

NAVAIR intends to use Non-Government personnel in the source selection for this effort. Non-Government personnel will have the need to access proposals in order to support evaluation and selection for the Government. Therefore, before an award, it may be necessary for the solicited company to enter into non-disclosure agreements with these individual companies. A prerequisite for receiving a contract award will be registration in DOD's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.    PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  THE DRAFT SOLICITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED 10 JANUARY 2003 FOR INDUSTRY INPUT.  The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an AH-1W Linkless Feed Program, which calls for replacing the current A/A49E-7 (V4) Turret System Linked Feeder Assembly with one that utilizes the Linkless, bulk 20MM ammunition that is common to all other DON 20MM systems (F/A-18, F-14, CIWS).  The 20 MM Linkless Feed modification will be installed in 191 AH-1W aircraft, and two (2) AH-1W trainers.  At a minimum, the new system should include replacement of the ammunition can, feed chutes and replacement or modification to the current feeder mechanisms for the AH-1W A/A49E-7 (V4) 20MM Turret System.  Additionally, the modified system will stay within existing size, weight, and power restrictions with minimal changes to the airframe.  Forward Aircraft Refueling Point (FARP)/shipboard requirements for ammunition loading in austere locations is a requirement.  This change will be incorporated into and reused when the AH-1W is remanufactured into the AH-1Z.  The intended procurement will buy three (3) Prototype(s) AH-1W Linkless Feed Systems in FY03, and will contain several priced options for exercise in following years, as funds become available.  The options will be structured so as to allow the Government flexibility to buy such quantities, up to the total requirement of 193 ship sets, as may be consistent with program funding.  Expected release of Draft RFP is 10 January 03 to solicit industry input.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate, AFRL/PR-West, Edwards AFB, CA is soliciting technical/management and business/price proposals for projects supporting the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program (IHPRPT) under Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) 03-01-PKT titled IHPRPT IX.  Responses to this solicitation are sought to develop an advanced technology base for rocket propulsion concepts and components aimed at supporting the IHPRPT program.  The IHPRPT program is the DoD/NASA/Industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  Capability infers the full spectrum of technological needs, such as performance, affordability, operability, reliability, and maintainability.  The IHPRPT program is structured in three phases to achieve pre-determined measurable increases in all rocket technology capabilities.  Phases I, II, and III specify technology demonstrations for each phase by the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
Miami, Florida

The United States Government intends to award three succeeding leases, in three separate buildings using other than full and open competition to Jones Lang LaSalle America, Inc., of Miami, Florida.  The leases will be for a total of 105,631 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of four years with no cancellation privileges.  In order for the agency to accomplish their mission the buildings must be located in close proximity within the same office park.  

The government has a continuing need for this space.

Draft Statement of Work  - I. Background: The Deputy Secretary serves as the principal policy advisor to the Secretary on all major program and management issues, including student financial assistance.  The Office of the Deputy Secretary (ODS) is also responsible for the internal management and daily operations of the Department.  In fulfilling these responsibilities, ODS requires technical assistance in performing a number of financial analyses related to programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965.  These analyses require specialized skills in and extensive experience with private capital markets, asset valuation, structured finance, optimization studies, risk mitigation techniques, and advanced economic theory, as well as a detailed understanding of the Federal budget process and the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.  II. Objectives: The objectives of this simplified acquisition are to augment ODS's financial analysis capabilities by providing specialized support in: 1) financial analysis related to the valuation of federal financial assets; 2) financial analysis related to risk mitigation techniques and probabilities; 3) other, currently unspecified analyses related to Federal financial assets.  III. Activities: Under this simplified acquisition, the Contractor shall perform an undetermined number of analyses identified by ODS.  For each, the Contractor shall meet with ODS within 2 days after initiation of the analysis to discuss ODS requirements and schedule of deliverables.  The Contractor shall propose a work plan within 1 week on initiation; ODS will have two days from receipt of the plan to approve or request revisions.  ODS shall review all draft analyses prepared by the contractor and meet with the Contractor within 3 days of delivery to either approve the completion of the analysis or request that an alternative approach be developed.  Based on this meeting a schedule for final results shall be developed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>INFORMATION ONLY UPDATE.....Previoulsy a site visit and pre-proposal conference was held and Q&A have been posted regarding the upcoming issuance of the two step IFB which shall be a 100% set aside for small businesses (see numbered note 1). The NAICS code is 541219 and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million.

Due to a delay in the appointmen of the Independent Review Officer for the Bureau which is necessary in order to review and certify the PWS and agency's MP, the expected date is estimated to be sometime in January to February timeframe for actual release of the solicitation document.  Please do not call or email until that time frame is reached.  Until an IRO reviews and approves the SOW it shall remain in draft form.

However, the updated version of the draft with changes made shall be posted in FEDBIZOPPS by 19 November 2002 for further review and analysis by those prospective vendors wishing to know its possible make up.  Realize that until the IRO process is complete, changes may, and most likely will be made to the final solicitation due out sometime in January-February timeframe.

Again, this is going to be a Two-Step Sealed Bid (IFB) solicitation for the function of Accounts Payable, under OMB A-76 Streamlined procedures.

<DESC>This notice is to answer questions posed by potential offerors regarding the original announcement for quotation number MDA112-03-T-0002.  Question 1)  Power output of the device, 100mW or 250mW?  Answer 1)  The device produced by TTI which we cited has a variable power output depending on the battery voltage applied.  A six volt battery gets 100mW, a nine 250mW and 12 500mW.  This is desirable as the conditions of surveillance may require less output to avoid detection or more due to the distance needed to transmit.  Question 2)  Any dimensional requirements of the device?  Answer 2)  The device must be easily concealable and not visible through one layer of material of a shirt pocket.  Question 3)  Frequency range 140? 164MHZ? Answer 3)  The Government has assigned frequencies that split the norm (141.275, 141.725, 151.275, 156.275).  The offered device must be programmed as such or synthesized with band that includes these frequencies.  The date for receipt of quotations remains November 22, 2002.  All other terms remain unchanged.  Point of contact in this office is Janet Janes, (916) 643-0322 or e-mail:  janes@tasa-exchange.army.mil.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place : Ms. Zhang Yuzhen, Director General, Foreign Affairs Office, PetroChina Company Limited, World Tower, 16 Andelu, Beijing 100011, CHINA, Phone: (86-10) 8488-6012, Fax: (86-10) 8488-6014  :  UNDERGROUND GAS STORGAGE PROJECT IN THE PEOPLE?S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assessing the development of an underground gas storage facility in the Jintan Salt Mine in the Changjiang Delta of Jiangsu Province, China.

In recent years, China has focused its energy needs away from coal and toward natural gas.  At present, gas makes up 3% of the energy consumed in China, but by 2010 the Chinese government hopes that the figure will be as high as 10 percent.  Four Chinese gas-producing basins, all located in the middle and western regions of China, contain over 70% of the country?s gas resources.  But the main market for this gas is located on the East coast.  Though producing gas now, these fields will not be able to meet the demand for gas until approximately 2015.  Until then, it is expected that China will need to import natural gas from central Asia and Russia.  To help meet the demand and facilitate distribution, PetroChina is building four trunk pipelines to complete its network and bring gas to the East coast.  In order to manage the peak and cyclic load operations of the West-East Pipeline and the other pipelines, a number of underground storage facilities will be required.

        The initial function of underground gas storage is to balance gas consumption and resources at all times (seasonal, daily and hourly fluctuations). Storage reservoirs also provide many more services such as a safety role and grid optimization.  In addition to these traditional functions, new services are emerging and underground gas storage facilities offer commercial possibilities (price hedging, better terms on import contracts, and export of storage capacity).  There are a number of advantages to storing gas underground, including the sheer size and volume of storage that underground facilities can manage, the low cost relative to the cost of above ground facilities, and the relative safety.  

	In order to enable the development of a regional gas distribution network, a large gas storage facility is required.  In the past, PetroChina has converted two depleted gas reservoirs into underground gas storage facilities.  The proposed project in the Changjiang delta will be the first constructed in a salt cavern and will require substantial foreign assistance and equipment.  Installations built in salt cavities are generally operated to cover peak demand.  They offer the advantage of productivity per well that is two to four times high than that of conventional facilities.  These salt caverns can be mined to varying shapes and sizes in order to accommodate specific storage requirements.  The shape and size of the caverns for this project will be determined in the feasibility study. 

The aim of the Feasibility Study is to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of using the Jintan salt deposits for underground gas storage.  Key elements of the study will include: determination of the stability of the rock salt and its structural properties, characterization of the type of salt caverns that could be developed at the proposed sites, development of a solution mining strategy, assessment of the safety of the proposed sites, and economic analysis of the proposed facilities, and an evaluation of environmental protection measures that need to be taken into account. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $460,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., local time, December 17, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Amendment 0005 to Solicitation SP0600-02-R-0098:
A. All offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of Amendment 0005 as stated in Block 11 of Standard Form 30.
B. The following request pertains to all installations, with the exception of the Army Reserves (Line Items 4803a-4803ag).
When updated pricing is requested, offer prices shall include all applicable taxes, with the exception of the Gross Receipts
Tax (GRT). Offer prices shall also include all competitive retail charges necessary to provide power to the point of delivery. 
C. The preference factor for renewable energy in the solicitation has been deleted. The Government is now soliciting
three (3) unit prices per kWh - one requiring 0% of the total quantity to consist of renewable energy that exceeds the
mandatory state requirement, a second for 5% of the total quantity to consist of renewable energy that exceeds the
mandatory state requirement, and a third for 10% of the total quantity to consist of renewable energy that exceeds
the mandatory state requirement. The Government may be willing to pay a premium for renewable energy, based
upon the resources available to the installations and the amounts of the premium differentials. Renewable energy
percentages in excess of 10% that would require payment of additional premiums are not desired.
D. Accordingly, the Note under 2 (iii) on page 10 of the solicitation is hereby revised to reflect the change. Clause M801
(PRICE EVALUATION FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY) on pages 13 and 14 of the solicitation is hereby deleted.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Weapons Division is conducting market research to determine the existence of manufacturers and sources to provide Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) format PC Cards and Linear PC Cards for Memory Loader-Verifier Sets (MLVS).  The MLVS is a piece of custom-built hardware that is used solely for the purpose of transferring Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) to Navy aircraft from a PCMCIA (PC) Card (called loading) or transferring data from certain Navy aircraft to a PC Card (called downloading).  The MLVS operates with its own custom-built software (called the MLVS Executive software) and does not operate within the Microsoft Windows operating system or any other commercial off-the-self operating system.  The MLVS currently uses a linear format PC Card.  Software has just been incorporated to utilize an Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) format PC Card.  It is desired to develop a list of ATA PC cards that are compatible with the MLVS.  It is also desired to identify manufacturers to continue to procure linear format PC Cards.  Through testing already accomplished, it has been determined that some ATA cards are compatible and some are not.  Currently the manufacturer/model number/description of ATA and linear PC Cards that are being used or have been used successfully in the MLVS are:  Linear PC Card: Smart Modular Technologies - 8 MB Card, Part Number - PM24270 (Commercial Grade), Smart Modular Technologies - 20 MB Card, Part Number - PM24130 (Industrial Grade), Smart Modular Technologies - 40 MB Card, Part Number - PM24277 (Commercial Grade).  ATA PC Card: Synchrotech - 64 MB Card, P/N - PCM-AFSP-M064 (Industrial Grade), Delkin Devices - 32 MB Card, P/N - DDA1FLS2-032 (Commercial Grade)  If additional manufacturers are identified, the Government intends to test the PC cards to ensure compatability with the MLVS.  Complete specifications and Test Criteria will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency homepage at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  Interested parties are requested to submit product information that includes:  a.  Complete specifications of each size/type of ATA and Linear PC Cards;  b. Identification of the Manufacturer of each size/type of ATA and Linear PC Cards and the business size of the manufacturer, if known (NAICS Code 334413, 500 Employees);  c.

<SUBJECT>A -- DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF HOOK TIMER ASSEMBLY PROTOTYPE
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NFFN7300300023
<RESPDATE>112702

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, Central Administrative Support Agency is seeking sources who can or have Designed and Developed a Hook Timer Assembly prototype.  The National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories in cooperation with the Atlantic Pelagic Longline Fishery, NMFS Sustainable Fisheries Division, and Protected Resources Division is conducting research to develop mitigation measures to reduce endangered and threatened sea turtle mortality associated with pelagic longline gear.  A significant need in the research is the development of a reliable device to measure trends in time and depth of sea turtle captures to reveal particular time intervals or depth of longline operations for which turtles are most vulnerable.  Experiments conducted in 2001 and 2002 revealed that hook daylight soak time is a significant variable in determining loggerhead turtle cpue by pelagic longline gear.  This data has resulted in a proposal to develop a timed bait release that could be used to avoid turtle interaction by releasing baits during the time when turtles are most vulnerable.  This technique could also be applied to reduce other longline bycatch, but neither can be accomplished without specific information on the times and depths at which turtles, target species, and other bycatch species interact with longline gear.  IT IS CRITICAL TO THIS PROJECT THAT RELIABLE HOOK TIMERS BE DEVELOPED, TESTED AND DELIVERED PRIOR TO THE 2003 FISHING SEASON (JULY 2003).

The following specifications describe the hook timer assembly units; however alternate proposals for a different design accomplishing the same goal for timing and giving consideration to the restrictions on exterior surface obstructions and weight, as well as the environment in which the units will be operating, will be considered for award.

The Hook Timer Assembly must operate reliably within a hostile marine environment of extreme temperature, pressure and vibration (shock).  The units must withstand temperatures of 0 degrees to 48 degrees C pressure of atmosphere to 700 PSI and shock force of ten (10) gravity.

The mechanical housing must provide a clear view of the liquid crystal display be equipped with eyelets which allow a quick and efficient attachment to the gangion, permit the installation of new batteries, provide a method for adjusting the tension force from two (2) pounds to ten (10) pounds at one (1) pound increments for the activation magnet removal.  Shall contain no obstructions on the exterior surface, which would snag during deployment or contribute to entanglement of the main longline.  The operational package shall be small light weight (less than one pound) naturally buoyant with minimal adverse effect from sunlight.

The electronics shall consist of a clock module (VOSCA Corporation CM-42A or equivalent) containing a liquid crystal display (LED) powered by one 1.5V AAA lithium battery, activated by a magnetically contained reed switch.  The clock assembly shall be designed such that when the magnet is removed power is applied through the magnetic reed switch contacts starting the counter.  The clock shall run continuously for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours and display the lapse time in the LCD in hours and minutes.  The electronics must not be encapsulated in a solid potting material thus preventing failure from temperature changes.  In the event AAA lithium batteries are unavailable, alkaline may be substituted provided a means to substitute lithium at a later time is provided.

Firms who can meet the above requirements shall respond to this sources sought announcement by 1:00 pm CDST on 27 November 2002.  Qualifications which make your firm responsive and responsible to this sources sought must be included in your response and mailed to Contracting Officer as given below:  U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA; 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a solicitation.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this announcement.  
All questions relating to this announcement shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Jean Jennings at Jeanie.M.Jennings@noaa.gov.

<DESC>Federal Highway Administration
Central Federal Lands Highway Division
Sources Sought


General Information:  The Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) is one of three Federal Lands Highway (FLH) divisions that solicit proposals from colleges, universities, research institutions, foundations, engineering or other consultants, federal/state/local agencies, or others who possess capability and experience in the subject area.

Title:  Archiving and Accessing Historical Construction Records Electronically

Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to scope out a larger archive effort of Federal Land Management Agencies' historical construction project records for the purpose of providing electronic access of the archive to the public.

Background and Scope:  The CFLHD has detailed reports of final construction records dating back to 1916 when the FHWA was known as the Bureau of Public Roads.  At least 41 boxes of these documents are archived in CFLHD storage areas, and it is estimated there are at least 20 reports in each box.  Another preliminary measure of the extent of the collection is that the CFLHD alone has over 3000 projects listed in an electronic catalog.  Similar records exist at the Eastern and Western Federal Lands Highway Divisions.  The National Park Service, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Fish and Wildlife Service also hold some records.

These documents are for roadways constructed in National Parks, Forests, and other access roadways and include advertised plans, as-built plans, and reports for final construction, reconnaissance, environmental, material, geotechnical, survey, and right-of-way.  There are also maps, histories of specific routes, black and white photographs, and bid tabulations.  The information is written on a variety of papers including carbon copies, onionskin, muslin, and plastic.  The written information, plans, drawings, and photographs hold historical value for Federal Lands Management Agency customers and the general public, and also contain key design and construction details unavailable elsewhere.  In its current form, the majority of the information is not accessible to a wide range of multiple users, nor is there a complete record of the extent of the materials.

A method is needed to tabulate the collections, electronically archive them, and provide easy access to this information for the public and private individuals.

Study Objectives: User's of the product of this study should be able to: 

1.Prepare a detailed statement of objectives for a larger archiving effort planned for the future,
2.Identify agency resources to support this future archiving effort, and 
3.Establish a process to periodically update the electronic archive.

Tasks:At a minimum, the proposed scope of work shall include the following tasks:

1.Conduct a literature search to identify the methods, procedures, current techniques, and best practices that are and can be employed to physically and electronically preserve and archive materials, especially related to historical construction project records.
2.Quantify the extent and character of existing archived materials held by the Eastern, Central, and Western Federal Lands Divisions, the National Park Service, the U. S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Anticipate and determine the varying levels of cooperation and commitment of the various agencies to the long-range effort.  Travel to Washington, DC, Sterling, VA, Lakewood, CO, and Vancouver, WA may be necessary.
3.Recommend and develop a specific process to physically and electronically preserve and archive materials with the focus to maximize the public's access to the historical information without their handling of the original documents.
4.Recommend and develop a process consistent with Task 3 to maintain the historical database, and physically and electronically preserve and archive materials from ongoing constructions projects as they are completed.
5.Recommend and develop a user-friendly electronic architecture and program on CD-ROM, which may be posted on an internet web page to provide access of the information to the public.   Include capability for at least:
i.	A searchable data base,
ii.	Organization, for instance, by State, Park, Forest, Refuge, or Indian Land,
iii.	Retrieval of separate photo views, 
iv.	Summary and specific formats for reports,
v.	Printing and downloading of information,
vi.	Section 508 compliance,
6.	Submit a draft report within 6 months after commencement of the study with a summary of the literature search, tabulation of agencies' holdings, and recommendations of how and where to best perform a full-scale archive.  The draft report should also present the developed electronic archive and access processes, formats, and reports, estimated resources needed, along with technical documentation and user manuals.
7.Meet with the technical panel to review the draft report.
8.Conduct a pilot electronic archive on the materials of at least six (6) sets of historical construction records to demonstrate the feasibility of the recommended process, and to show that the information may be collected without damaging the original documents.
9.Demonstrate the Archiving and Accessing Historical Construction Records Electronically process to the technical panel, incorporate any reasonable modifications, and provide the completed electronic structure to the FHWA.
10.Submit a final report in both the form of a camera-ready copy and Microsoft Word.  Include updated information from Tasks 6 and 7 along with additions found while completing Tasks 8 and 9.
Sources Sought:  Sources interested are to respond by e-mail by 4:30 pm (MT) on November 29, 2002.

<SUBJECT>G--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER TO the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, Inc.
<DESC>GovWorks, Procurement Operations Branch, U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, in support of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Minority Health, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The DHHS is joining with and providing funds to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, Inc., to develop a five-year comprehensive action plan for a pilot faculty/student fellowship program for the 45 public Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) / Minority Institution members.  The development of the Pilot Program will be a 12 month period of performance.  The DHHS seeks to improve the ability of educational institutions to service racial/ethnic minorities and to develop an action agenda to address health and human service concerns of Asian American and Pacific Islanders.  All of these activities are related to the Department's efforts to respond to presidential executive orders. This comprehensive plan should involve a focus on career tracks involving health-related areas, biology and social sciences and center on (1) best practices through faculty exchange, (2) cutting edge research, and (3) curriculum and program enhancement.  This plan should address program goals, methods, implementation, and management considerations.  The methodology should clarify program goals for mentees, HBCUs, and for the African American community and greater society.  It should also describe opportunities for meaningful problem-solving discussions between talented TMSF college faculty, scholars and Federal/private agency staff.  The desired outcome of this program is that: (1) solutions to enhance the country's critical health and human service issues are identified, (2) academic success and competitiveness of faculty at selective HBCUs are enhanced, and (3) the TMSF will serve as a pipeline for new minority talent joining the workforce and for member faculty who may serve as resources to the Federal and private sectors.  It is expected that this program will enhance the ability of TMSF member institutions to continue to bridge the gaps in addressing racial and ethnic health disparities and the development of a diverse workforce.  The Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund is widely recognized within academic, government, and African American communities for its history in providing supplemental assistance in the form of merit-based scholarships and programmatic support to students attending HBCUs, capacity building support to its 45 member schools, intern and mentorship programs, and leadership training and support to students preparing for undergraduate and professional schools.  It remains a vital player in the arena of health and education policy impacting minority populations in this nation.   This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services in accordance with FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund for this procurement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities or submit quotes.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the Government will consider all quotes received no later than Dec 16, 2002, at 2pm.  POC:  Jane M. Carlson, Contracting Officer, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed to Jane M. Carlson at the following email address:  jane.carlson@mms.gov.  Telephonic questions or requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>CONSULTING SERVICES TO ASSIST IN AN AUDIT ON THE SAFETY STATUS MEASUREMENT SYSTEM (SAFESTAT) IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOW BELOW:

Statement of Work for 
Outside Consultant on Audit of 
Safety Status Measurement (SafeStat) System

I.	General Information

A.	The Safety Status Measurement System (SafeStat) is an automated analysis system that uses data on crashes, roadside truck or bus inspections, and on-site compliance reviews to measure the relative safety fitness of interstate motor carriers.  The system uses extensive data that is maintained by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  This includes records on over 600,000 motor carriers, annual reports on approximately 110,000 bus and truck crashes, and results from over 10,000 compliance reviews conducted annually.

B.	Congress has requested that the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Transportation conduct a comprehensive independent investigation of SafeStat.  The Congressional request specifically asks that the OIG review the validity and objectivity of the methodology employed by SafeStat and the quality of the data used in calculating the SafeStat ratings.  Failure to have sufficient expertise to analyze the complex computer model used and the large amount of information processed by the system will make it difficult to provide a credible reply to all the Congressional concerns by March 2003, which is the time period specified in the request.  

II.	Scope of Work

The work requires expertise in statistical sampling and quantitative methods as well as familiarity with the requirements for conducting audits using computer applications.  Specifically, the contractor will be required to:

A.	Assist in the assessment and replication of an effectiveness study performed in 1998 by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.  This includes critiquing the assumptions and methods used in the earlier study and identifying an appropriate methodology to use for comparing crash rates between motor carriers identified by SafeStat and those that were not.  

B.	Recommend methods to use to examine the validity of the SafeStat model, to include, but not limited to, tests for ensuring that any interdependence among the model?s elements are accounted for to guard against double counting of the risk factors.  

C.	Provide recommendations, as required, for conducting tests of the computer applications that process the algorithms used for the SafeStat model.

D.	Assist in the development of a statistical sample of data used by SafeStat to determine the degree to which data is not complete, accurate, or timely.  This includes assisting with the identification of different strata, determining appropriate sample size, and identifying appropriate methods for selecting the sample.  An adequate sampling plan is needed given the extensive data and source material that must be analyzed to respond to the Congressional request. 

E.	Assist in the assessment of industry concerns about bias in the SafeStat system against certain geographic regions or industry sectors.  Recommend analysis using appropriate statistical tools to quantify the degree and significance of interstate differences in data reporting. 

F.	Evaluate preliminary results and conclusions formulated by the audit team and determine if there are any errors in the execution of the sample selection methodology and in the extrapolation of results to the overall population.  

G.	Recommend adjustments to the sample or to the review plan based on the audit team?s findings during the course of the review.

H.	As required, serve as expert witness before Congress or Departmental officials to provide credible support and explanation for the reviews methodology and conclusions.
I.	
Work to be performed under the contract is not to exceed 120 hours.  

III.	Deliverables

The contractor shall deliver 2 written deliverables, in hard copy or disks as required, identifying the following:

A.	Deliverable #1:  (a)  Recommended methods for replicating prior study and assessment of assumptions and methods used in prior study.  (b) Recommended methods to use in assessing the validity of the SafeStat model. (c) Evaluation of stratification plan and sample selection methodology developed by audit team for meeting the objectives of the review.  

B.	Deliverable #2:  (a) Evaluation of team results to identify errors in sample size, sample election, or in the extrapolations made to the overall population. (b) Evaluation of team results to identify additional work needed to validate the SafeStat model or more fully assess prior study results.  

Due Dates for all deliverables to be established by the audit team following contract award.

Work will require periodic meetings at Office of Inspector General offices in Washington, D.C. and may require occasional meetings in Boston, MA.  Any travel costs submitted must conform to Government regulations and will be reimbursed based on actual costs incurred.

IV.	Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be between established in the approved audit plan.  At this time it is expected to be between November 2002 and April 2003.
