<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Lab Division and the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Malvern Instruments Incorporated for a STP5942 Long Bench Spraytec real-time spray measurement system and a STP2300 Spraytec inhalation cell.
<p>NIOSH is investigating the role of aerosol particles produced during coughing in the spread of influenza. As a part of this work, an aerosol measurement system is needed for two applications.</p>
<p>1) The NIOSH cough aerosol simulation system produces a high concentration aerosol used to study the survival and spread of airborne viruses. A system is needed to measure the aerosol expelled by this system during experiments. The system must be capable of measuring and recording aerosol particle size and concentration for particles from 0.1 to 900 microns in diameter with concentrations up to 1,000,000<br />particles/cubic centimeter, and with an acquisition rate of at least 2.5 kHz and at least 35 logarithmically-spaced size bins. The system must measure the aerosol properties as the particles are expelled from the cough simulation system without drawing a sample or interfering with the flow of the aerosol. A method of externally triggering the data collection during each cough is also required.</p>
<p>2) Human clinical studies of cough generation during respiratory maneuvers such as coughing are also being conducted as a part of this project. For these studies, a system is needed that is capable of measuring and recording human-generated aerosols over a total particle size range of 0.1 microns to 2 mm. The system may perform these measurements during two separate experiments over two size ranges if<br />necessary. As with the simulation system, an acquisition rate of at least 2.5 kHz and at least 35 ogarithmically-spaced size bins are needed, the system must measure the aerosol properties as the particles are expelled by the patient without removing a sample or interfering with the flow of the aerosol, and a method of externally triggering the data collection during each cough is required.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCG-2010-83907, CDC NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or e-mail to RMULLENAX@CDC.GOV or FAX to 304-285-6083. Phone 304-285-5880. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Malvern Instruments Inc., 117 Flanders Rd, Suite 110, Westborough, MA 01581-1042 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about June 18, 2010. The Department is seeking offerors for a contract that contains a feasibility assessment and an option to execute a rigorous quasi-experimental evaluation of program implementation strategies in Upward Bound. The PURPOSE of the optional evaluation is to examine the relationship between Upward Bound implementation strategies and student outcomes. In addition, the design and feasibility phase of the study will also examine the applicability of the Upward Bound evaluation design options to seven other TRIO programs, including Talent Search, Educational Opportunity Centers, Student Support Services, Ronald E. McNair Post baccalaureate Achievement, Veterans Upward Bound and Upward Bound Math-Science.</p>
<p>The primary research questions for the feasibility and design phase of the study are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Can a rigorous quasi-experimental evaluation of implementation strategies of Upward Bound be carried out?</p>
<p>2. Can the rigorous quasi-experimental designs developed for Upward Bound be applied to other TRIO programs?</p>
<p>3. Are there other evaluation designs that could be used to assess implementation strategies of Upward Bound and/or the other TRIO programs?</p>
<p>The research questions for the optional evaluation phase of the study are as follows:</p>
<p>1. What implementation strategies, including services, recruitment strategies, and retention strategies are commonly used by Upward Bound projects?</p>
<p>2. Are the different kinds of implementation strategies used by Upward Bound projects associated with improved student outcomes?</p>
<p>3. Does the association between implementation strategies and student outcomes differ for students with different characteristics?</p>
<p>4. Does the association between implementation strategies and student outcomes differ for projects with different characteristics?</p>
<p>The Department anticipates the period of performance for the base phase of the contract will be 21 months. The Department anticipates that the period of performance would be extended by 39 months to a total of 60 months if the option for the evaluation were exercised.</p>
<p>The TRIO programs are federal pre-college programs designed to help economically disadvantaged students prepare for, enter and succeed in college. The largest and oldest TRIO program, Upward Bound was designed to improve college access and completion by assisting low-income (family income under 150 percent of poverty) or potential first-generation college students (neither parent with a bachelor's degree). Upward Bound serves high school students ages 13-19 years old.</p>

The cabin is next to the beach and is easily accessible by boat or float plane at most tides.  The cabin is located in Misty Fjords National Monument, which is a designated wilderness, so no power tools are allowed.  All on-site construction will be by hand tools.  There is no fresh water source near the cabin.

<DESC>PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY &amp; PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES
<p>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTDC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under contracts N01CM42200, N01CM42201, N01CM42202, N01CM42203, and N01CM42204. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. DTP is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications. The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.</p>
<p>Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment-managed basis. Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement, multiyear" contracts resulting from this solicitation. Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually, per contract The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents and dogs including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, of the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in rodents, dogs and/or non-human primates treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm. For purposes of this RFP, a pharmaceutical, chemical or Biotechnology Company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that prior to awarding of funds for contracts involving the use or intended use of animals in research; an acceptable assurance statement must be on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR).</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Draft Study Report, Final Study Report, Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five years (4/1/2011 through 3/31/2016).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>

Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a firm, fixed price contract to procure forty-two (42) Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) GPS Antenna System-1 (GAS-1), Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) antennas, P/N N100-6-2, from EDO Corporation, Bohemia, NY, in support of the CH-46E helicopter program (PMA-226). The NAVWAR GPS antenna is an anti-jam antenna installed aboard military aircraft to protect aviation navigation equipment from GPS jamming signals. This effort will procure forty-two (42) GPS antennas in two lots; the initial lot will be for fourteen (14) antennas and the second lot will be for twenty-eight (28) antennas. Delivery will begin in January 2011 at the rate of six (6) per month.
<p>The proposed contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to EDO Corporation, Bohemia, NY, since the antenna design is proprietary to EDO. This is the only antenna that meets the CH-46 program's needs because it is small enough to fit the available space and has the most outputs. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inquiries regarding the availability of subcontracting opportunities should be directed to Ms. Jeannine Spignolo, telephone 631-218-7058, at the following address: EDO Corporation, Antenna Products and Technology facility, 575 Johnson Avenue, Bohemia, NY, 11716. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort described above.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Governments intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. (BAH),  8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102 for 260,000 manhours  and associated Travel and Materials  that will provide  continued research, design, development, integration, installation, test and evaluation, fielding, analysis, maintenance, training and logistics support of Navy, Army, Air Force, Special operations Forces, Joint Services, Federal Agencies, Counterdrug and other agencies Communications-Electronics Advanced Technology (CEAT) systems. These CEAT systems include analog and digital, communication/telecommunication, voice, data, video to include Video Teleconferencing (VTC), Distance Learning, Briefing and Display Systems (BDS), imagery, information warfare, cyber warfare, virtual labs, distributed processing, neural and information network systems, subsystems and equipment.  These systems are employed on various air, shore, manpack/handheld, transportable, boat and vehicular platforms.  The technical services are currently being performed by BAH under contract N00421-09-C-0016.  This acquisition will result in the modification of existing BAH contract N00421-09-C-0016 by adding a cost plus fixed-fee level of effort Option II with a performance period of approximately one year that will run from 16 April 2010 through 15 April 2011.    This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of contract ceiling by 15 April 2010, approximately six months early due to an increase in project requirements.  The proposed additional one year option is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Awarding to any contractor other than BAH would result in unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks, such as the program requirements for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the Marine Corps Distance Learning (MCDL), the United States Marshall's Service (USMS) and the United States Capitol Police (USCP) efforts.  These services are nonseverable as no other firm can provide the corporate capabilities, intergrated program support, technical expertise and resources needed to effectively meet the requirements of these programs.  BAH is the only source available that can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the short time period (one-year) between the exhaustion of the current Option Year I under, Contract N00421-09-C-0016 which expires 16 April 2010 and the follow-on contract due to be awarded 16 April 2011.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-09-C-0016 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAH is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 12 February 2010, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  For information contact Theresa Newbold, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, Telephone (301) 342-9921, FAX (301) 757-2276 or via email: theresa.newbold@navy.mil.

<DESC>This acquisition will provide subsystems, replacement subsystems and parts, both consumable and repairable, repair of repairables, upgrade parts for the Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) family, as well as incidental services for the repair of repairables, installation of the replacement parts, and assistance with developmental flight testing.  The Scan Eagle UAS family consists of the Insite, Integrator and Night Eagle, with each using the same ground subsystems.  The UAS subsystems consist of the Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV), Ground Control Station (GCS), Forward Ground Control System (FGCS), Skyhook retrieval system and SuperWedge pneumatic launcher.
This contract is anticipated to be a noncompetitive award to Insitu, Inc., because this UAS family was developed exclusively at private expense and this company has a patent on these UASs and their subsystems.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by the agency.
The 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded after a request for proposal solicitation.  It is anticipated that it will be awarded on or about 1 November 2010.  Destination will be to China Lake, CA and Bingen, WA, as specified in individual delivery orders.  The quantity will be specified in individual delivery orders up to the IDIQ maximum.

<DESC>The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) requires support services for the Department of the Navy (DON) to conduct security declassification reviews in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 13526, "Classified National Security Information," of 29 December 2009, for the review of classified DON records within the deadlines established by the E.O.  The E.O. established national policy for the classification and declassification of information by Executive Branch agencies, including the DON, and directed the automatic declassification of information contained in records of permanent historical value once they reach 25 years of age, unless reviewed and exempted. This required agencies to create both an automatic and a systematic declassification program.  
The Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) established the process for DON compliance with the requirements of the E.O. 13526, as amended.  Additionally, the SECNAV appointed the Director, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (DIRNCIS)/Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Special Assistant for Naval Investigative Matters and Security (N09N), to be the Coordinator of the DON declassification effort and Chairman of the SECNAV Declassification Oversight Committee.  The Committee is tasked with monitoring the progress of the overall DON Declassification Project.  
The SECNAV charter designates that a contractor serve as the Executive Agent to manage the day-to-day operations of the initial and continuing declassification effort for the DON, and complete and maintain an inventory of all DON responsible records that are located at DON archive sites, and federal archives and record centers throughout the continental United States.  
This is a sole source supplemental action to be included under Contract N00140-05-D-0014 to Vangent, Inc., for seven months while the follow-on acquisition under Solicitation N00189-09-R-Z065 can be procured.  Vangent, Inc., is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>58--Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS)

<a href="mailto:jean.p.bretz@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Portland</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).  Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  Self-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons.  Cabled receivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS.  Receiver clocks are synchronized across all receivers with time obtained from GPS receivers.  Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish.  Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in laboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging.  A mobile receiver consisting of a single-4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on actively migrating tagged fish.   In 2010, the USACE intends to award a multi-year (one year with four option years) firm-fixed price single award task order contract for the manufacturing and delivery of the above receiver types.  In addition to manufacturing this contract will include line items for the repair or upgrade receivers as well as a line item for technical support.  All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package.  Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided.  Government furnished hydrophone assemblies designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be recommended for use in the cabled, mobile, and portable receivers.<BR><BR>This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase.  In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria, the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation.  The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to two qualified firms.  These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action.  The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of two fully functional prototype autonomous receivers that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor.  Following acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract.  Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.  The solicitation (RFQ) outlining receiver specifications will be posted on or around 15 June 2010.<BR><BR>The primary Contracting Point of Contact is Lea Zumwalt.  She can be contacted at (503) 808-4608, or by e-mail lea.m.zumwalt@usace.army.mil. <BR><BR>

This solicitation provides for services and materials for the Military Health Services (MHS) to share in the industry wide charge to reduce the risks of infections.  APIC memberships will connect the MHS to other healthcare professionals who are working to improve patient safety while reducing the risks of infections.  The objective of this procurement is to obtain 70 memberships for Hospitals, Ambulatory Clinics, Dental Clinics, and Regional Commands and Headquarters elements within an existing national patient safety organizations program to facilitate collaborative efforts in improving patient safety between leading corporations, federal agencies, renowned medical facilities, and experts within the healthcare industry.<BR><BR>This notification is being issued in accordance with FAR 6.302; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC) provides a service that is one of a kind as it relates to the medical community.  APIC provides access to tools and resources that have historically been used to enhance and reduce the risks of infections. After exhaustive research via the internet beginning on 17 March 2010 and a review of infection control policies and standards it quickly became evident that APIC is the forum many of the medical associations use as the premier source when discussing infection control policy, procedures and best practices.  Through APIC the MHS will have access to a host of programs and services designed to help advance MHS practices and stay abreast of new developments.  APIC is the only entity located that provides members with an expansive and diverse network of experienced professionals who share a common bond through their commitment to reducing the risk of infection and improving patient outcomes. APICs growing membership includes infection prevention and control professionals, epidemiologists, quality and patient safety experts, clinicians, administrators, public health officials, and other healthcare professionals from across the continuum of healthcare.  With its expansive and diversified membership, APIC provides the MHS access to information and data that can be used to support bridging the gap between the MHS and civilian medical counterparts.<BR><BR> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  This notice is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received within fifteen (15) days after publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.

<DESC>1.	Conduct a shipcheck of the USNS COMFORT to gather the necessary information to conduct an investigation of the feasibility of the following launch and recovery alternatives (The investigation shall include the following:  1. Regulatory Impact; 2. Cost Impact; 3. Ship System and Structural Impact; and 4. Weight and Stability Impact) (Note: Boats or RHIBs shall be assumed loaded with operating personnel and patients during the recovery operation):

1.1.	Remove two lifeboat/davit sets and replace in the same location with new rescue boat davits capable of lowering and retrieving new 10m RHIB rescue boats.
1.2.	Remove two lifeboat/davit sets and replace in the same location with new lifeboat gravity davits capable of lowering and retrieving the existing U Boats.  
1.3.	Add new hinged rescue boat davits capable of lowering and retrieving the existing U Boats in the same location where the U Boats are currently stowed. Note: The U Boats are currently stowed P&S adjacent to the aft, old, pre-conversion deckhouse.
1.4.	Add new lifeboat gravity davits capable of lowering and retrieving the existing U Boats in the same location where the U boats are currently stowed.  
1.5.	Reinforce/Redesign the existing embarkation platform to permit it to safely operate in SS 4. This assumes U Boat launch and retrieval using the new crane aft.
1.6.	Install a hydraulically operated, hinged, recessed platform that opens near the waterline similar to the platforms on cruise ships that embark passengers to cruise tenders. This assumes U Boat launch and retrieval using the new crane aft.
1.7.	Install a Vehicle Launch and Recovery System similar to the system on board the Littoral Combat ships using a 10 m RHIB. System would be built into the hull with hinged, hydraulically actuated, flush WT closures.
1.8.	Install a wet dock similar to a system on an amphibious assault ship suitable for either U Boats or 10 m RHIBs. System would be built into the hull with hinged, hydraulically actuated, closures. Variations could include WT closures to permit emptying the well when not used, or non-tight, swash closures where the well would remain wet all the time.  
1.9.	Install a Modular U Boat Floating Dock used with the existing embarkation platform. The U boat bow would rest on this dock system, but the stern would still be afloat. The modular pieces would be partly submerged with water ballasting and be heavy enough when assembled to offer some resistance to the wave action and make it easier for passengers to board the platform. GFI sketch to be provided to bidders upon request.  

2.	Conduct a literature search and market survey for other potential alternatives, including the Contractors own ideas. 

3.	Prepare a report summarizing the findings with recommendations.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a Sources Sought Notice to help determine the availability and qualifications of qualified businesses that can accommodate hotel lodging for patients and their families as they participate in clinical research protocols at the Clinical Center.  The   Government is seeking sources in order to adequately provide accommodations to our patient and family population.  This Sources Sought notice is not a request for proposals but an announcement requesting offerors interested in this type of requirement to provide a detailed package that specifically addresses information provided in this notice for review.  The information from this Sources Sought notice is for planning purposes and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy.  
As stated above the purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to find qualified businesses in which the Government can establish Blanket Purchase Agreement with multiple contractors to provide lodging accommodations for the Clinical Center (CC) patients.  The lodging accommodations for our patients and their families should be affordable and conveniently accessible to our facility.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110.  The primary objective of this announcement is for offerors to provide an extensive package to include:
	Lodging  that is suitable for patients and their families that are going through very sensitive clinical protocols and may require various accommodations;
	Quality standards of the facility (Hotel standards);
	Discounted rates that will not only meet the Federal Government standards, but for the patient if they pay direct and or rates that can be passed on to the patient;
	Location of the hotel facility within the radius recommended in this announcement;
	Special needs for accessibility for patients who have major or minor health restrictions;
	Reservation processes;
	Transportation - (In this announcement the Government has made recommendations, but would ask the offeror to provide how they would handle patient transportation when requested;
	Short Term and Long Term stays ( example not to exceed 30 days);
	Accommodations that include a kitchenette or refrigerator for medications or dietary needs. The Government will conduct site visits at the locations to address customer service and what it entails and hotel quality standards.
The Government does not want to limit the requirement to just what is suggested in this announcement. Therefore, in addition to the required information, offerors are being asked to include the best overall processes that will suitably assist the Government in providing satisfactory services for patients and their families during their stay.
Background:
The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesda, Maryland, is Americas clinical research hospital and the worlds largest hospital dedicated totally to clinical research.  Through clinical research, promising discoveries in the laboratory are translated into better health and health care for all.  
At the Clinical Center, clinical research participantsmore than 350,000 since the hospital opened in 1953are active partners in medical discovery, a partnership that has resulted in a long list of medical milestones.
Currently there are about 1500 clinical research studies in progress.  About half are studies of the natural history of disease, especially rare diseases, which often are not studied anywhere else.  
The NIH is involved in the enrollment of persons worldwide in the clinical research protocols.  Since these patients are a critical part of the NIH mission, corresponding travel may be in part paid for by the NIH.  These patients come and go to the NIH Clinical Center (Building 10).  There are approximately 100,000 outpatient visits per year, which creates the NIH requirement for lodging accommodations for patients and their families as they participate in clinical research protocols at the Clinical Center.  
The Clinical Center is a unique facility in that all patients are on a research protocol and over 50% of patients are from across the country and are often here for extended stays.  The needs of this type of patient population differ from a community or academic medical center that draws from a more local based population.  Patients may be more anxious, often they are alone, or do not have as many visitors, of family members for support.  That has made caring for the patient a value that is highly held in the Clinical Center.  The lodging accommodation experience is one aspect that affects the patients experience, and as such it is important that it is a positive experience.
Lodging Requirements:
1.	The lodging accommodations must be compliant with the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) and be within per diem allowance for Washington DC Metropolitan area;
2.	The lodging must be available for transient and extended stay (up to 30-dayssome patients are here for months).
3.	The lodging must be Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) compliant rooms at or below per diem rates with flexible terms.
4.	Provide accommodations for smoker and non-smoker based on hotel regulations.
5.	There is also a need for patients that require accessibility to lower level floors for wheelchairs, and animals that provide assistance to patients, i.e., seeing  eye dogs.
6.	Set-aside lodging accommodations that meet acceptable quality standards requirements.
7.	Provide kitchenette and/or refrigerator for storing medications or special dietary, if needed.
Location Accommodations:
To accommodate the various patients needs the location of the lodging accommodations can vary.
1.	Located within a 30 mile radius of the National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center for very sick patients.
2.	Located within 20-25 miles depending on local transportation arrangements of National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center for ambulatory patients.
3.	Lodging  accommodations that are located within walking distance and/or near to amenities such as stores, restaurants, pharmacies, banks, bus stops, metro stations are preferred.
4.	Proximity to local airports may also be considered.
Rate Requirements:
1.	Provide the Federal employee government per diem rate or comparable.
2.	Provide same negotiated price throughout the calendar year; not a seasonal rate.
3.	Provide bill rate that will allow a low rate for patients and their families.
4.	What type of rate is negotiable for rooms that are canceled?  This is due to the fact the patient travel may change due to their medical condition and the cancellation maybe necessary.
Payment Requirements:
The Government is looking for discounted rates that are affordable and comparable with per diem standards.  Those pricing arrangements should be included when addressing the requirement in the Sources Sought announcement.  There are times when the patient may obtain lodging directly and the Government shall deem that those rates be in line with discounts and rate scale of Federal Government per diem for the patients.
Reservation Requirements:
1.	What are the alternative reservation options to patients who do not have credit cards if paying directly?  Would the Clinical Center have a payment option under these circumstances?
2.	What is the reservation process that allows patients and the Clinical Center to make reservations and still receive a negotiated patient rate?
3.	What would be the reservation process that ensures that only the appropriate government officials can make reservations?
4.	Determine reservation process that validates individuals as Clinical Center patients and how would the hotel handle?
5.	Determine reservation process that accommodates requests made during the day and night.
Shuttle Requirements:
-	Provide scheduled shuttle service for patients on Mondays through Fridays from ____________ AM to _________PM.
When the offeror addresses these items, the list below is suggested by the Government but would consider recommendations on the hotel processes:
-	Provide on demand shuttle services on Saturday, Sunday, including Government holidays.
-	Provide on demand shuttle services during Government closures, i.e. for weather related closures.  The Clinical Center does not close when the Federal Government closes since it is a hospital.  The shuttle services would still be required.
-	Provide on demand shuttle service to accommodate varied patient appointment schedules. The contractor can state what they have available in reference to transportation services and how it may assist our patients and families.  (The patients will range from incapacitated, very sick to those who are ambulatory but need minor assistance).
The information requested in this Sources Sought shall be due on by close of business May 25, 2010 at 10:00AM local time.  Include in your package the following: Name, address, phone no, fax, email, point of contact, all reference material listed in this announcement and send to Ms. Deborah Britton, Senior Contracting Officer, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Suite 106; Bethesda, Maryland 20892; Phone No. 301-594-5914 and email dbritton@cc.nih.gov.

This Sources Sought is in support of a market survey being conducted by Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHD/NSWC) to determine potential sources capable of manufacturing a metal detector. This metal detector will be used to scan nitrocellulose. This is a 1.3 flammable material when wet, but 1.1 when dry so the metal detector must be compatible with this as well as alcohol vapors.  The metal detector must meet the following specifications: 

.	System shall be fully integrated such that all that is required for installation is attaching conduit, wires, and bolting unit to the floor. .	Mounting frame to straddle 30" long x 30" wide x 35" high area for filled container.	Tray for material must be at least 4 ft x 4 ft. This tray will have to be at a decline (approximately 5 degrees) that feeds into the inlet of the Metal Detector. The lip on this tray should be 4" high..	Throughput needs to be able to detect a 2 mm diameter aluminum sphere (Minimum requirement).	All electrical requirements have to meet Underwriters Laboratory Standard:o	Class 1 Div 1 Groups C and Do	Class 2 Div 1 Groups E, F and G.	Throughput should be as large as possible and still be able to safely detect 2 mm aluminum sphere .	There must be a signal to the operator when metal is detected: .	Audio signal (ex. an alarm).	Visual signal (red light)..	The system will be used to metal detect Nitrocellulose wet with Ethyl Alcohol. Nitrocellulose is a 1.1 explosive when dry so the system should be able to be rinsed with water.
All interested sources shall provide a company brochure or list of equipment specifications, organization name, address, a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a construction project entitled, Units #3-6 Cavitation Repair at Lower Granite Dam in Whitman and Garfield Counties, Washington.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will be a firm-fixed-price contract.<span style="COLOR: blue"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Construction magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance is approximately November 2010 through November 2011. A bid bond of 20% will be required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>100% Performance and payment bonds will be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The work consists of providing all labor, technical expertise, materials, equipment, scaffolding and appurtenances necessary to accomplish the following turbine cavitation repairs for Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 at Lower Granite Powerhouse:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Cavitation damage repair shall be performed on the turbine discharge ring only. A portion of the existing discharge ring material shall be ground or milled to good metal and anchoring the discharge ring/draft tube liner to the concrete. The contractor shall install 1 inch diameter reinforcement bars into the predrilled holes with epoxy-resin cartridges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After curing, the bars will be welded to the interior surface of the discharge ring and the ends cut off and ground flush. The discharge ring shall be spot repaired, built up with mild steel weld metal, stainless steel weld overlay placed, and the discharge ring surface ground and machined to the finished profile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is some removal of concrete and restoration of the concrete surfaces and architectural finishes to the required lines and grades.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;The Contractor shall refurbish the discharge rings by removing material from the existing ring by machining, sanding, or grinding methods; repair and overlay welding; and surface finishing of the welded areas by machining and/or grinding, unless otherwise approved. No more than a 1/2 inch thickness of weld material shall be uniformly laid on the discharge ring, unless otherwise approved. Localized cavitation and surface damaged areas shall also be repaired. The contractor shall provide a procedure that describes the method of monitoring the weld interpass temperature and a detailed description of the method of protection of the turbine and generator from damage due to the repair process if that process involves unit rotation (e.g., thrust and guide bearing during machine rotation for discharge machining; weld current through the thrust or guide bearing).</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Welder qualification shall be in accordance with one of the following codes: (1) Section 4, Part C, of AWS D1.1, or (2) Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME BPVC), or (3)AWS B2.1 (for cladding), whichever is most applicable to the work being performed.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Cavitation repair welding will distort the discharge ring/draft tube liner causing it to pull away from the concrete behind it. The resulting voids must be filled with epoxy to absorb vibration of the discharge ring during turbine operation. The contractor will perform drilling and washing the epoxy injection holes and air relief holes; making epoxy-injection connections; furnishing, transporting, mixing and injection of the epoxy; patching the finished epoxy injection holes; clean-up of the draft tube lining and such other operations as are incidental to the drilling and epoxy-injection. Following the repair welding, the Contractor will inject a two component low viscosity epoxy resin adhesive behind the discharge ring/draft tube liner to fill voids created by distortion.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Runner Blades, Runner Cone, Runner Hub Repair, Seal Retainer Segments and other Water Passage Elements are optional work items that would require excavation and deposit of mild steel or 309L stainless steel to a depth that is within 1/4 to 5/16 inch of the finished surface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This area would be finished with a stainless steel overlay.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.hq.usace.army.mil. At the Headquarters homepage, select Safety and Occupational Health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement of their current or past technical experience (what the firm has done) and current or past performance (how well the firm did it) similar to or the same as the requirements stated above, will be used in the determination whether to set aside this requirement for small business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Include your firm's bonding capacity and a statement indicating the size of your business (small business, 8(a) small business, HUBZone small business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concern) to Phyllis Buerstatte, Contract Specialist, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, Washington 99362 or email responses to Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your response to this notice must be received on or before close of business on May 19, 2010.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>

<DESC>This is a "Sources Sought" notice.  The VA National Acquisition Center is issuing Request for Information (RFI) VA-797M-10-RI-0174 for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Tucson Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) to identify potential sources for off-site data storage for seven locations: Charleston, SC; Chelmsford, MA; Hines, IL; Lancaster, TX; Leavenworth, KS; Murfreesboro, TN; and Tucson, AZ.  The contractor shall provide transportation and storage facilities at each location to accommodate 700 media tapes. Two tapes will be picked up from each facility on a weekly basis to be transported to the off-site storage facility. The tapes will be rotated on a weekly basis and must be capable of being returned within a four hour time frame if needed. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 518210 and the small business size standard is $25 million.  One critical element the government will address during this exploratory phase is to attempt to determine contractor capabilities. The off-site storage facility must be of distance to have the least probability of being affected by the same natural disaster as the on-site facility. Selection will be based on past performance and technical capability.  A determination will be made once all information is reviewed for the type of Small Business set-aside concern.  However; if the government receives inadequate responses from Small Business concerns, the government will use all information obtained from this sources sought request to determine what type, if any, set-aside to utilize.  To be eligible for award, the contractor must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR website http://www.ccr.gov.  In addition, please include any information if you presently offer this system on a current GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract.  Any questions regarding this notice should be directed to Nonya Trower, at (520) 209-3140 or by email to: nonya.trower@va.gov. Please respond no later than close of business 20 May 2010.

<DESC>Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) and the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop the Biological Enhancement of Hydrocarbon Extraction (BioTiger<sup>TM</sup>). Scientists at the SRNL have discovered a new environmental biocatalyst for improving the recovery of hydrocarbons entrained in sediments utilizing a patented consortium of microbes known as BioTiger<sup>TM</sup>. The technology is a method for microbial enhanced oil recovery for recovering oil from an oil-bearing rock formation. The methodology uses a consortium of bacteria including a mixture of surfactant producing bacteria and non-surfactant enzyme producing bacteria which may release hydrocarbons from bitumen containing sands. The described bioprocess can work with existing petroleum recovery protocols. The microorganisms are also useful for treatment of above ground oil sands, ground waste tailings, subsurface oil recovery, and similar materials to enhance remediation and/or recovery of additional hydrocarbons from the materials. BioTiger<sup>TM</sup> may also be useful in oil processing (cracking). US Patent No. 7,472,747 has issued on this technology.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source Notice For the following:


1.      Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:
Agency: Library of Congress
Requiring Activity:  Acquisitions and Processing of Foreign Materials
2.     	Nature and/or description of the Action Being Approved:
The minimum needs of the Library of Congress to acquire Collections from many underdeveloped countries can only be met by: 
        Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy LOCs requirements (FAR 6.302-1);
6.302-1 (2)(i) (A) 	Demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see definition at 2.101), or, demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the particular research services proposed
 The Library needs an established international organization with reliable networks to assist with the acquisitions and processing of foreign materials in regions in which standard acquisitions methods cannot meet the Librarys collection development needs.  The organization must be well-established and have active relations with local governments, local publishers, local scholars, the U.S. scholarly community, and U.S. research libraries.  The organization must be familiar with bibliographic record production standards and processes and have the capacity to perform this work.
The Council of American Overseas Research Centers (CAORC) is the only U.S.-based organization that is in the best position to meet the Librarys needs.  CAORCs research centers are located in countries and regions from which it is difficult and financially not feasible for the Library to acquire materials by area experts.  Established in 1981, CAORC serves as a base for virtually every American scholar undertaking research in the host countries.  CAORCs access to U.S. experts in the region, its network of center libraries, and global locations place it in a unique position to meet all of LCs acquisitions and processing needs.


        Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services (FAR 6.302-3);
6.302-3 (a)(2)(ii) 	To establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center
CAORC is an independent 501(c)(3) organization that is a not-for-profit federation of independent American overseas research centers.  All centers are independently incorporated in the United States as private, not-for-profit organizations.  
Funding from CAORC comes from the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Smithsonian Institution, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, institutional memberships, and center membership dues.
Almost 300 American universities, colleges, museums, and research institutes and societies hold institutional memberships in CAORCs 22 member centers. CAORC and the centers annually grant more than 200 fellowships for overseas research to students and faculty at these and other American institutions. In addition, an average of 500 researchers from the Fulbright programs, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Social Science Research Council, and group projects, as well as independent scholars, affiliate each year with the CAORC overseas centers for facilities and research support services.

3.        	Description of the Services Required to meet the Agencys needs:
The Library seeks assistance acquiring and processing materials in regions of the world for which standard acquisition methods do not work or are impracticable.  This assistance includes acquiring materials for the Librarys collections, providing bibliographic descriptions of that material, and shipping that material to LC-Washington.  In addition, the Library needs a local representative to arrange access to digital works that are available online.
4.          	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting other than Full and Open Competition:
This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR Part 6.301, which authorizes under certain conditions, contracting without providing for full and open competition.


If Any source is capable of performing service, please contact Library prior to Mat 17, 2010 by 3p.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program was established to provide robust scientific information regarding the status and trends of critical natural resources in the National Parks. There are 32 multi-park networks in the I&M Program. The Central Alaska Network (CAKN) consists of Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, and covers 22 million acres, or 25% of all land administered by the National Park Service nationwide. In order to track the condition of our parks, Central Alaska Network scientists have chosen 37 key indicators, or "Vital Signs," to represent the overall health of the network. Each Vital Sign falls into one of 4 categories: physical environment, plant life, animal life, or human use. 15 vital signs relate to animal life, 12 relate to the physical environment, 4 relate to human use, and 6 relate to plant life. Underlying these 4 vital sign categories is a focus on habitat change. This focus allows us to predict and possibly model future variations on the landscape. With some idea about predicted change, managers can develop better strategies for resource protection. 
Natural resource monitoring is conducted primarily for two purposes: (1) to detect significant changes in resource abundance, condition, population structure, or ecological processes; or (2) to evaluate the effects of some management action on population or community dynamics or ecological processes. Monitoring data are most useful when the same methods are used to collect data at the same locations over a long time period (e.g. more than 10-12 years). The CAKN Inventory and Monitoring Program is being designed to last for well beyond this time frame.
Three of the CAKN Vital Signs relate directly to stream and rivers, and include water quality, stream and river flow, and the distribution and abundance of freshwater fishes. These three Vital Signs are interrelated and represent different ways of examining change in these important ecosystems. To fully evaluate any of the various aspects of stream ecosystems, how those ecosystems may be changing, and what those changes mean requires an accurate and ongoing appraisal of the water chemistry of the systems (that is, what are the concentrations of various important dissolved compounds such as nutrients). Because the streams of the Central Alaska Network are relatively pristine (unpolluted), the natural levels of many of these compounds are very low. This means that in order to accurately monitor these ecosystems, we must be able to accurately quantify very low concentrations of these compounds. Very few water chemistry vendors are able to repeatably and accurately detect the low levels we require, because highly specialized methodologies are required to attain that level of data quality. The Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (CCAL) was established over 30 years ago specifically to carry out these kinds of specialized analyses. The CAKN flowing waters program and the CAKN shallow lakes program have relied on CCAL to analyze water chemistry samples since 2006.  1. FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(B)(1)(i) the  Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory at Oregon State University, is the only laboratory that can provide the services required due to the level of testing needed and continuity in data.

15. Alkalinity (APHA 2320, titrate to pH 4.5. Modifications: Use 0.02N Na2CO3 and 0.02N H2SO4, 0.2 mg/l +/- 0.02 mg/l)
16. Specific conductance (APHA 2510; Wheatstone bridge, 0.4 microS/cm +/- 2%)
17. Total Dissolved Nitrogen (APHA 4500-NO3 F; APHA 4500-P J., detection limit 0.01 mg/l +/- 0.01 mg/l)
Laboratory specifications:
a. The laboratory must be experienced in the analysis of low-level nutrient concentrations in water samples from oligotrophic systems.
b. The laboratory must conform to EPA surface water chemistry criteria.
c. The laboratory must participate in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program.
d. The laboratory must provide a detailed Quality Assurance Plan to CAKN.
e. The laboratory must use prepared NIST-traceable calibration standards.
f. The laboratory must, when sample volume allows, run duplicate analyses for 10% of samples per analysis.
g. The laboratory must be located in Alaska or the Pacific Northwest to minimize transit time for shipment of frozen samples.
3. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.): The Central Alaska Network has selected this laboratory to analyze its water samples because CCAL is capable of detecting extremely low levels of the chemical constituents found in Alaskan waters. Unlike most water chemistry labs, which specialize in the analysis of wastewater or water from polluted locations, CCAL specializes in the analysis of nutrient research samples from natural lakes, streams, precipitation and groundwater in unpolluted areas. Our samples are collected in pristine streams with extremely low nutrient concentrations; as such, we require the low detection limits provided by CCAL. CCAL has more than 30 years experience analyzing these kinds of water samples. CCAL is also capable of dealing with the high concentrations of DOC often found in streams in Alaska. The highly colored nature of water from these systems can compromise the accuracy of measurements and many labs are not equipped to deal with the required color corrections.CCAL has a well-developed Quality Assurance Plan that insures delivery of precise and accurate results. CCAL laboratory techniques conform with EPA surface water chemistry criteria and CCAL participates in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program, an external interlaboratory QA Program, to monitor the accuracy of analytical procedures. Participation in the USGS Standard Reference Water Survey Program insures that measurements made in different laboratories will be of comparable quality and in principle will be directly comparable. Data produced by CCAL from a standardized set of protocols allow direct comparisons among diverse studies, creating a legacy of data that grows with each new study. This conformity increases the value of data collected by the CAKN flowing waters monitoring program and allows us to compare our data directly with that collected by other monitoring networks. This in turn increases our power to detect environmental change on a regional level.  By standardizing detection and measurement of the chemical and physical properties of water, and by eliminating the need and expense of establishing duplicate facilities, CCAL operations are beneficial to both cooperative and individual research projects. For these reasons CCAL continues to be the least expensive lab operating under a good Quality Assurance Plan capable of measuring the low concentrations that we require. CCAL is also being used by the CAKN shallow lakes program, as well as by other I&M networks, including the Southwest Alaska Network and the Pacific Northwest Network.
Another important reason we selected CCAL was due to its relatively close proximity to Alaska. The water samples we collect must remain frozen until they are analyzed. It is not feasible to ship samples cross country as we risk the samples thawing and thus compromising the quality of the data. CCAL is located in Oregon and we can easily transport samples to the lab before the samples thaw and begin to degrade. When shipping from remote areas such as Kotzebue or Nome samples often arrive in Oregon partially thawed. It is important we have a lab that is close to Alaska. 
 The success of the CAKN flowing waters monitoring program depends upon the ability to detect and quantify subtle changes in natural processes with confidence. CCAL has demonstrated for the past three years that they are capable of providing us with the high quality data we require. 
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: A sources sought was submitted to the National Business Center with no vendors responding that were able to test to all the required levels.
In 2006 a market evaluation was completed of laboratories in Alaska and Pacific-Northwest. We also requested quotes from labs throughout the US. At that time CCAL was identified as the best source. 
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  N/A
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Sub factors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delivery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or sub line items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.<br /><br />CONTRACT CLAUSES<br /><br /><br />52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (APR 2009)<br />(IAW FAR 12.301(b) (4))<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).<br />__ __ Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).<br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996) (31 U.S.C 3553).<br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (Oct 2004) (Pub.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-39)

1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)
 
  Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. ***

Background:  

NISTs Physics Laboratory has a requirement for a Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which will be used for the measurement of very low activities of beta- and alpha-emitting radionuclides, e.g., H-3, C-14, Fe-55, Co-57, Co-60, Ni-63, Sr-90 + Y-90, Tc-99, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ba-133, Pb-210+Bi-210, Po-210, Ra-226 + daughters, U, Np-237, Pu-241, Pu-239, Pu-240, Am-241, Cm-243, and Cm-244. Although a significant fraction of these radionuclides have gamma ray emissions that are normally used for measurement, the quantitative analysis of very small activities of these species is greatly facilitated by chemical separation from complex matrices followed by measurement of their beta or alpha emissions with high efficiency by liquid scintillation counting in the presence of very low background rates.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

1.	The main sample light detection configuration shall consist of at least two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).

2.	The instrument shall offer an automatic spectrum stabilization capability to monitor and adjust the PMT high voltages in order to keep the signal output constant. 

3.	The background signal shall be kept as low as possible by means of both active and passive radiation shielding, pulse amplitude comparison, electromagnetic noise suppression and static electricity elimination.  Acceptable background rates for H-3, C-14 and alpha-emitters are given in specification 11.

(a) The active shielding shall consist of a separate guard system for detection of cosmic radiation and environmental gamma radiation that surrounds the sample detection system such that the sample detector signals are in anti-coincidence with the guard signals. 
 
(b) Active and passive shielding surrounding the sample detection system shall be standard, integral components of the instrument.

(c) The instrument shall offer a pulse amplitude comparison feature to decrease background from optical crosstalk and shall be adjustable by the user to minimize this crosstalk.

(d) Potential electromagnetic interference with the sample signals from power cables and radiofrequency sources shall be suppressed or eliminated automatically.

(e) Deleterious effects and spurious false events from static electricity shall be prevented by an appropriate device such as an ionizing source to protect against formation of static electric charges on sample vials, moving sample holders and other parts of the equipment.

4.	Additional instrument stabilization and low background maintenance shall be ensured by appropriate internal temperature control/cooling.

5.	Pulse shape discrimination between signals produced by alpha and beta emissions is required and shall be user-adjustable to optimize the electronic separation of alpha and beta events. It shall enable measurement of alpha events in the presence of a 100,000-fold excess of beta events. Simultaneous spectral acquisition of both alpha and beta signals must be possible.

6.	Instrument shall offer quench indication monitoring by means of an external radiation source. 

7.	All sample and guard event data, both coincident and non-coincident, must be accessible for examination to evaluate guard performance.

8.	Instrument shall offer dual programmable multichannel analyzers to provide multiple counting parameters and full spectral analysis capability.

9.	The Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer must have a fully-programmable, PC-based operation running on a Microsoft XP software platform with live spectral display capability as well as instantaneous monitoring of the status of the current measurement. It must also be able to store and retrieve previously acquired spectra.

In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

 Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. 

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<DESC>A single contract awarded as a result of this acquisition will provide support to a coordinating center for the ALLHAT trial to enable and foster scientific contribution based on extensive ALLHAT data and other resources and to expand collaborations with relevant clinical and scientific communities outside of ALLHAT. 

Hypertension affects one third of the U.S. adult population and is associated with substantially increased risks of heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal failure and coronary heart disease.  Because of high prevalence and associated morbidity and disability, it contributes significantly to health care costs.  

ALLHAT was funded in 1993.  It was a randomized, double-blinded, practice-based trial designed to determine whether the incidence of major coronary heart disease (CHD) events (primary endpoint) is reduced in high-risk patients with hypertension treated with a calcium channel blocker (CCB; amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril), or an alpha-blocker (doxazosin), each compared with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) as first-step therapy.  The Lipid-Lowering Trial, conducted in a subgroup of the ALLHAT participants (N=10,355), was designed to compare open-label pravastatin with usual care for prevention of total mortality (primary endpoint).  Between 1994 and 1998, 42,418 participants were recruited from 623 clinics, mostly primary care, across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  After an average of 4.9 years of follow-up (3.2 for the doxazosin arm, which was terminated early), the investigators reported that the primary endpoint, a composite of fatal CHD and non-fatal myocardial infarction, did not differ across the randomized treatment comparisons  despite better metabolic profiles in the participants randomized to receive the newer antihypertensive agents.  In addition, the diuretic-based therapy was superior to the alpha-blocker, ACE inhibitor and CCB-based therapies in preventing one or more major forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke and heart failure.  

The ALLHAT participants have been followed since the end of the trial in 2002 through national administrative data bases, including the National Death Index (NDI), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), United States Renal Data System (USRDS), and Social Security Administration (SSA).  Outcomes data through 2006 are currently being analyzed.  During the combined active and passive average follow-up of nearly 9 years, about a third of participants died.  

The purpose of this renewal is to optimize scientific advancement from the study by leveraging NHLBI's investment in the existing resources.  The renewal will complement the ALLHAT public access data base.  While it is important to have databases publicly available, and many research objectives (including training of early stage investigators) can be met this way, complex concepts and analyses (especially those involving merging data sources) will be best achieved (or in some cases may only be accomplished) through collaboration with an experienced investigative team who understands the intricacies of the study and nuances of the original data set.

Given the modest amount of funding, the extension is envisioned as complementary to the existing and future investigator-initiated sources of funding.  Potential research areas that can be engaged during the proposed extension under the leadership of the ALLHAT Steering Committee and, where appropriate, in collaboration with the GenHAT Steering Committee are described below.  Funding for some of the components, primarily to obtain pilot data or synthesize available information to stimulate and enable investigator-initiated grant writing, would be provided by the contract funds while major research questions would be addressed through other funding mechanisms.

Selected Research Examples

In this next phase, ALLHAT investigators in collaboration with outside researchers and practitioners will further evaluate predictors of long-term clinical outcomes, overall and by randomized treatment assignment, in complex demographic and clinical phenotypes represented in the ALLHAT study population.  These analyses could include multimorbid conditions in 2,772 participants with new-onset heart failure during the main trial; 22,551 with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m2) at baseline; 15,740 with Type II diabetes at baseline and 1,458 with incident diabetes during 4-8 years of active follow-up.  Additional hospitalized and fatal events have been collected from the administrative databases. 

The extension is also expected to take to a new level ALLHATs contribution to pharmacogenetics of hypertension as data emerging from the genetic ancillary study (GenHAT) show potential for contribution to genetically-guided personalized medicine.  Recently completed pilot analysis of a limited frozen sera resource offers a possibility of assessing relevant biomarkers such as NTproBNP and adiponectin in a context of randomized treatment assignments.

The following examples of research areas that may be engaged under this extension illustrate the rich potential of continued support for the ALLHAT infrastructure.

 	Long-term follow-up and hypertension decision/economic model 
 
ALLHATs large and diverse population with long-term follow-up offers a unique opportunity to inform development of a decision model for patients with hypertension. There is an established model for CHD but not for hypertension.  Extension of the passive follow-up, which by the end of 2011 will result in an average overall follow-up of about 14 years, is a cost-effective way to learn about long-term outcomes in high CVD risk elderly patients with hypertension.  The resulting database will also provide opportunities for health services research.  
 
                    Evaluation of atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline and during follow-up
 
ALLHAT baseline and follow-up (bi-annual) ECGs have been centrally coded (University of Minnesota) for AF. In addition, the ALLHAT Heart Failure Validation Study collected information on AF occurring in the context of nearly 3,000 hospitalizations with heart failure.  To date, only one manuscript on this topic has been written, which describes factors associated with prevalent AF at baseline (N=423) and baseline characteristics associated with development of new-onset AF (N=641) during the randomized phase of the trial.  The incidence of AF was analyzed by randomized treatment assignment, and in-trial clinical outcomes in those with prevalent and new-onset AF were reported for the entire cohort.  Future research may focus on genetic and other markers of racial and gender differences in AF prevalence, incidence and response to antihypertensive treatment.  In addition, because ALLHAT excluded individuals with symptomatic heart failure or known LVEF<35% at baseline, an opportunity exists to evaluate the occurrence and prognosis of AF in a context of randomized antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in participants without heart failure and in ~2,000 participants who developed new-onset heart failure during the active follow-up phase of the trial.  Additional information on hospitalized and outpatient AF diagnoses may be obtained from administrative databases.
 
	     Contribution to personalized medicine
 
The ALLHAT/GenHAT collaboration has the potential for bringing closer to reality a promise of personalized medicine with respect to pharmacotherapy of hypertension  through 1) the richness of phenotypes, 2) genetic information obtainable on almost all ALLHAT participants, which can be analyzed in a randomized setting to evaluate how genotype modifies treatment effects on major clinical outcomes, and 3) assessment of predictive role of baseline levels of several important biomarkers on long-term clinical outcomes, overall and by randomized treatment assignment.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NICHD-10-111 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standards are $7.0M.  However, this solicitation is a not a set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure the Professional Services of AlgoTek, Inc to continue to provide technical and scientific advice to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in order to promote and advance the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiative (MOBCI).  The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  

The MOBCI Broad area Announcement is aimed at promoting high-risk, high-yield, scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding, rather than focusing on a specific system of solution. Algotek, Inc was first retained as a special expert consultant to the NIAAA in the 2007 at the beginning to provide advice on the development of a revolutionary research initiative on the mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorders. Algotek has the unique capabilities needed for this project as demonstrated by education, training, work experience, success in managing highly competitive, revolutionary research programs w/in the Federal Government.  Algotek have unique familiarity with the current project because of their recent experiences in providing consultation on its formulation and development.  Algotek expertise and credibility in mathematics, neurophysiology and computation science, as well as their demonstrated ability to establish highly effective revolutionary research programs, are essential to the NIAAA in establishing this research program.  Algotek has developed new approaches for evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of novel computational methods and for comparing and integrating the results of heterogeneous research programs. Algotek has the professional standing and experience to attract and integrate world-class researchers normally outside the field of alcohol research, but with potentially valuable insights into the field, to collaborate with alcohol researchers.  Furthermore, Algotek has excellent relations with a number of Federal agencies that will maximize co-funding opportunities for the NIAAA. 

In continuing with our work since 2007 for FY10 Algotek, Inc will be involved in the following activities: 

	Continue to consult on technical questions and agenda preparation for proposal site visits
	Continue to participate in proposal site visits

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 135.0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Guatemala </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">is a lower middle-income country with a per-capita income of $2,600. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">It is Central America's largest country in terms of economy and population and plays a pivotal role in regional trade and integration. Nevertheless, Guatemala is the third most unequal country in the world for income distribution:</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>51% of the 12.9 million people live in poverty, and 15% are extremely poor; 71% of the population considered poor is concentrated in rural areas. The inequalities between urban and rural and indigenous and non-indigenous populations reflect the limited social investment by the Government of Guatemala (GOG) for the poor. Public health expenditures in Guatemala are amongst the lowest in the Western Hemisphere with only 1.4 % of GDP going to the health sector in 2009 and 3% to education.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 135.0pt">&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">As a result of historical inequity and the low health and education investment in the country, Guatemala is challenged with some of the lowest social indicators in Latin America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Fifth Demographic and Health Survey (ENSMI 2008-2009) indicates that Guatemala has a total fertility rate of 3.6% - </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">the fertility rate is the highest in the hemisphere (3.6 per woman); infant and maternal mortality are proportionally high (30 per 1,000 live births and 290 per 100,000 live births, respectively); and only 51.3% of births are delivered by a skilled health provider.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> The stunting rate in rural areas is 51.8% and 28.8% in urban populations, with chronic malnutrition at 58.6% for indigenous children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Malnutrition can lead to learning disabilities, blindness, hearing loss, impaired brain development and low resistance to disease. Deficiencies of iodine, iron, and Vitamin A cause considerable disability. </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 135.0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Chronic malnutrition in Guatemala is the result of inequality, exclusion and poor nutrition and hygiene practices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Addressing the problem requires leadership from the Government of Guatemala (GOG) and a cohesive and well-coordinated strategy among the different organizations implementing the National Food Security Strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also one of the priorities for the USG and the GOG and for the USAID/HEO portfolio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 135.0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">In the education sector, close to one million children ages 5 to 17 do not attend school and most of these are indigenous girls in rural areas. Net primary school enrollment has risen dramatically (from 76% in 1991 to 98% in 2009) yet Guatemala has the lowest primary school completion rate in Central America. For every one-hundred school-age children, 98 enter first grade, 55 complete sixth grade and 18 finish high school; only 8.5% of university-age youth pursue a higher education. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 135.0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">USAID's long-term goal for the health sector in Guatemala is to foster awareness and political will to increase national and local investments in health and education. &nbsp;USAID programs are focused on increasing the coverage and quality of basic health services, supporting an enabling environment to reduce disparities related to gender, geography and ethnicity, and integrating health and education interventions where appropriate.&nbsp; USAID supports the public sector, collaborates closely with NGOs and engages the corporate sector in alliances for health and education.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a non-competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRT57-10-Q-80051 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. The NAICS Code is 531120 and the Small Business size standard is $6.0M. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a Non-competitive basis with Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Burlingame, CA. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to lease three parking spaces from the Enterprise Care Rental Company in order set up a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor needed to conduct wake turbulence measurements at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), in accordance with the following Statement of Work.
<p>Statement of Work (Begin)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Volpe Center is to lease three parking spaces from the Enterprise Car Rental Company located on 1333 Bayshore Highway, Burlingame, CA, in order to set up a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor needed to conduct wake turbulence measurements at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The Volpe Center is given the responsibility by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to collect, process and analyze wake turbulence data to support the designs of wake mitigation solutions for its NextGen effort. Currently 75 percent of the FAA wake turbulence program funding is from the NextGen office, and it is anticipated that in FY11, the funding profile will be 100 percent from NextGen. One of the NextGen deliverables required of the FAA in FY10 is to study the feasibility of dependent approaches for Closely Spaced Parallel Runway operations under Instrument Meteorological Conditions involving Heavy and B757 aircraft. The envisioned procedure is termed WTMA, which stands for Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Arrivals. WTMA is considered a key enabling piece towards the realization of NextGen.</p>
<p>The objective of the Volpe Center's LIDAR deployment at SFO is to collect wake vortex measurements off Heavy and B757 aircraft in support of the FAA's WTMA procedural study. These types of aircraft typically fly to major international routes and SFO is one of the few locations in the United States with significant number of Heavy and B757 class aircraft operations. The study also requires measurements of vortices generated between 150-200 feet altitude range. This means a candidate test site should be somewhere between 3860 ft to 4800 feet from the runway threshold. For SFO, this technical specification means we are restricting our search in the city of Burlingame, CA, between 1200 to 1333 Bayshore Highway. Ideally, the LIDAR would be deployed sometime between February 22, 2010 and February 28, 2010 to ensure a timely removal of the system from its current location.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide the Volpe Center an area of the equivalent to three parking spaces to host a trailer carrying the pulsed lidar sensor in the form of a lease. The vendor shall ensure the immediate area between the Lidar and the bay is in its natural un-obstructed state. Volpe Center personnel and contractors shall be allowed access to the site to perform other installation related and maintenance tasks with a minimum of one day advanced notice.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>One year from Date of Award, with an option for an additional year.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (End)<br /><br />Proposal Pricing: The Contractor shall provide a proposal on the following items. Please provide the most current Lease Agreement with your proposal.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Lease of Land for 1 year, in accordance with the SOW above, Quantity: 1 YR, Total Price tiny_mce_marker__________; CLIN 0002 - Optional Line Item - Lease of Land for 1 additional year, Quantity: 1 YR tiny_mce_marker__________. The signed offer must be submitted electronically, via email to Karen.Marino@dot.gov. The offer should be addressed to the following: U.S. Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attn: Karen M. Marino, RVP-32, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142 no later than 2:00 P.M. EST on February 10, 2010.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>Title: Freeboard Preservation of CGC WAESCHE (WMSL 751)
<p><br />This is a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P30CM5 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

Therefore, offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms. The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.<br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Past Performance, Technical Capability, Proposal Risk Assessment, and Price.<br />1) Technical Capability, which consists of the following equally weighted factors:<br />(a). Suitability of the proposed platform to paint CGC WAESCHE from the water. This includes the length, width and draft of the proposed platform, and method of anchoring and/or mooring the platform in a position to allow safe painting operations in open water and exposed weather conditions normally expected during the month of May at Coast Guard Island in the Oakland, CA Estuary. It also includes the offerors understanding of requirements to introduce a platform inside the physical security barrier that protects ships moored at the pier at Coast Guard Island (called a "whisper wave"). This includes use of a suitable commercial vendor to open and close the barrier for initial access, any additional access the contractor requires, and ultimate removal. The offeror must also demonstrate the method by which it will be able to shift its work platform along the port side of the ship during contract performance as the Coast Guard will require that cleaning and painting being at the bow at commencement of the performance period and end at the transom/stern doors.<br />(b). Suitability of equipment proposed to conduct the cool water wash of the freeboard from the proposed platform, and to provide contractor access from this platform to all areas that need to be cleaned and painted, including the bridge wings with an estimated height of 45 feet above the water line, and the transom and opening doors at stern of the ship. <br />(c). Suitability of the methods proposed to conduct all operations in a manner that will prevent a "discharge" (to the standard of No Reportable Release per 40 CFR) of paint or any other prohibited materials into the waterway.<br />2) Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items, specifically painting of vessels 210 feet or longer from the water, either currently being performed or completed in within three years prior to the date of this synopsis/solicitation. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:<br />(a) Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />(b) Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />(c) Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />(d) Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />(e) Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.<br />3) Proposal Risk Assessment: In addition to the above evaluation factors, the Government will perform a proposal risk assessment of each proposal at the Technical Capability sub-factor level. This risk assessment will evaluate the degree to which the proposed method of performance has potential impact upon: (1) Safety of contractor personnel while working from a floating platform to a height of approximately 45' above the ship's waterline. (2) Potential for damage to CGC WAESCHE from the size and plan of mooring and/or securing the proposed barge/float to accomplish the required painting. (3) The demonstrated capability of the barge/floating platform to provide space and operating equipment that will be needed to conduct the low pressure wash down and all required painting. (4) The potential for discharge of prohibited substances into the environment, and (5) Risk to schedule, price, performance and/or the level of Government monitoring that may be necessary during contractor performance. This risk assessment will aid the Source Selection official in making the best value determination.<br />4) Price: The aggregate price determined by totaling the offer price for the definite items, plus the composite labor hour extended total.<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>INSPECTION OF CUTTER PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF OFFERS<br />(a) All prospective offerors are urged to visit the cutter and visually inspect each item of<br />Work and to become acquainted with local conditions, locations of items and fixtures,<br />removals, replacements, interference and the nature of work. The CGC WAESCHE will<br />be available for ship check during the solicitation process. Please call LT Anthel &lsquo;Evan' Barnes, Project Manager of the CGC WAESCHE, at (510) 637-5964 to arrange a ship check.<br />(b) Failure to inspect the cutter will not relieve the offeror from responsibility for properly estimating the difficulty or cost of successfully performing the work.<br />(c) The Government assumes no responsibility for any representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers, agents, or employees before execution of the contract unless included in the solicitation, documents incorporated therein or amendments thereto.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH<br />(a) An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.<br />(b) The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.<br />(c) Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.<br />(d) The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.<br />(e) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.<br />Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals should be written AND NOT EXCEED TEN (10) PAGES and submitted in a legible format. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; text-transform: uppercase;">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistan&rsquo;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and after initial success in this area PTI expanded to NWFP (North West Frontier   Province) in late 2008.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing its efforts to bring security and development to the border areas, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), in order to attract investment to the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.<span>&nbsp; </span>The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. <span>&nbsp;</span>Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. <span>&nbsp;</span>The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;</span>In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. <span>&nbsp;</span>The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. <span>&nbsp;</span>The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. <span>&nbsp;</span>In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. <span>&nbsp;</span>In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. <span>&nbsp;</span>The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. <span>&nbsp;</span>When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. <span>&nbsp;</span>As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. <span>&nbsp;</span>If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. <span>&nbsp;</span>If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">USAID&rsquo;s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country&rsquo;s political process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. <span>&nbsp;</span>The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. <span>&nbsp;</span>When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. <span>&nbsp;</span>As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. <span>&nbsp;</span>If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. <span>&nbsp;</span>If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. <span>&nbsp;</span>Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. <span>&nbsp;</span>The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;</span>In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. <span>&nbsp;</span>The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. <span>&nbsp;</span>The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. <span>&nbsp;</span>In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. <span>&nbsp;</span>In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. <span>&nbsp;</span>The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. <span>&nbsp;</span>When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. <span>&nbsp;</span>As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. <span>&nbsp;</span>If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. <span>&nbsp;</span>If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</span></p>

<p>Question: We would like to understand the size, shape and any other mechanical detail available. This detail will determine the design of the frame and how we will accommodate the "corner load test". We realize there are several versions so the largest scales size would be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Answer: P/N AC30-60, made by Intercomp, and P/N AN60-6, made by GEC, are the 2 largest scales.</p>
<p><br />This posting also extends the due date for proposals to&nbsp;2 June 2010, 4 pm EDT.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 3325 and has a need to expand to 3872 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Moorhead/Clay County, MN, that will expire May 31, 2010. The lease term requirement is five years. The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2010. The delineated area is bounded as follows:
<p>North- County Road 15 <br />East- State Highway 71<br />South- State Highway 62 <br />West- County Road 13</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:<br />Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)<br />Parking - 30 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor's control</p>
<p>The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:<br />1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.<br />2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)<br />3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.<br />4.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>This announcement is amended as follows: Paragraph 3. Selection Criteria, Professional Qualifications, the words "in house" are deleted from the end of the first sentence.<br /><br />1. REGIONAL ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT INFORMATION. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) to provide for the primary disciplines of Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by September 2010. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is restricted to HUBZone businesses only. The Government may award multiple contracts in response to this announcement at any time until one year from the closing date of this announcement. Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified. All interested A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small, disadvantaged firms. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330, and the corresponding small business size standard is $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year with four, one-year option periods, an annual contract value of $1 million, and a total IDC value not to exceed $5 million. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted. USDA APHIS currently has, and may award in the future, IDC contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement. The selection board chair will consider the selection criteria below in deciding which contractor(s) will be selected. If more than one firm is selected, the top-ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined by the employees' office location (not the location of the work).<br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Regional A/E will include Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Structural work for the preparation of contract drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and possible associated services such as: LEED design services, NEPA documentation and environmental assessments, designer of record services, commissioning, value engineering, design (peer) review, master planning, facility inspection for deficiencies, obtaining various required permits, construction management, geotechnical investigations, surveying, and performing Construction Inspection Contractor (CIC) services. CIC services may or may not be related to work designed by said firm if and when used. Projects will cover a variety of building types nationwide, such as offices, laboratory, animal and plant inspection stations, quarantine stations, and general utility buildings. Some work may involve only one or two disciplines, i.e., Mechanical/Electrical, where repair and/or remodeling are involved and other types of work might include incinerators, fumigation hoods, compressed gas facilities, water and sewer mains, and water treatment facilities. Some of our major facilities are located in Mission, TX; Ames, IA; Newburg, NY; Fort Collins, CO; Miami, FL; and Beltsville, MD. New buildings generally will be in the $100,000 to $5,000,000 cost range. Repair and remodeling work varies from a few thousand to $500,000 cost range.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122) and water distribution (NAICS 221310) systems at Dover Air Force Base (AFB), Delaware.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688  Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric distribution and/or water distribution system at Dover AFB, Delaware, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Monday, January 4, 2010.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the February-March 2010 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

Dover Air Force Base (AFB) is home to the 436th Airlift Wing (AW) and the 512th Air Force Reserve Airlift Wing.  The installation is located in the center of the Delmarva Peninsula approximately 3 miles from downtown Dover, Delaware.  Dover AFB size is about 3,750 acres. The Base employs approximately 4,200 military, 1,200 civilians, and 2,500 reservists.  It has two runways and approximately 227 buildings for industrial and administrative uses.  A church, elementary/middle school, plus a Community Area (Lodging, Swimming Pool, Shoppette, Chapel, Youth center, golf course and housing referral office) are located on the West side of State Route 1.  A new Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) and Youth Center were recently constructed in this area.  
	
Electric Distribution System Description
	
The Dover AFB primary electric distribution system is made up of two substations (North and South) and 6 feeder circuits that deliver primary power across the base at 12.47 kV using a grid that is made up of overhead and underground power lines.  The majority of the system is currently overhead, but a number of projects are currently underway or in the planning stages to replace and convert overhead portions of the system to underground.  The six primary distribution feeders (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) are currently active.  A seventh circuit also exists, referred to as Feeder 6, which previously supplied electricity to the Military Family Housing (MFH) areas and was deactivated when the MFH areas were privatized. MFH is connected directly to the local electrical utility provider, the City of Dover Electric Department (Dover Electric).  

Dover Electric feeds the high voltage Dover Electric owned switching station located at the north substation with two 69 kV sources that come in from off-Base property.  The switching station distributes this 69 kV over Air Force owned aerial conductors to the Air Force owned north and south substations. The north substation equipment is located in the same switching yard as the Dover Electric switching station.  The south substation is just over a mile south of the north substation and receives power (at 69 kV) through an Air Force-owned transmission circuit that parallels Atlantic Street.    Each substation has a main aerial switch that feeds a high voltage oil filled circuit breaker on the line side of a 10 MVA, three phase transformer that converts the 69 kV to 12.47 kV for primary distribution. The north substation has four circuit breakers that serve four 12.47 kV primary distribution circuits designated as feeders 1, 5, 6 and 7.  The south substation also has four circuit breakers.  Three serve the three 12.47 kV primary distribution circuits that originate at the south substation (2, 3, and 4) with the fourth circuit breaker serving as a spare.  

Dover AFBs primary distribution circuits include a cross-connection/isolation and sectionalizing tie-switch system installed to provide flexibility in system operations. The goal has been to allow points on base to be supplied electricity from either the north or south substation if needed. Switches within the system are pole mounted and pad mounted.   Transformers are pole mounted and pad mounted and sized as needed to match demand at the point of service.  The system currently includes pole mounted capacitor banks on five of the feeder circuits.

The majority of the 12.47 KV primary power distribution system is overhead and some is underground. The overhead primary power distribution system consists of pole-mounted fused cut-outs that feed either pole-mounted transformers with overhead secondary service lateral drops terminating on weather-heads on the outside of a building or pad-mounted transformers with underground secondary service that feeds electrical equipment on a building.

Water Distribution System Description

Dover AFB produces water from on-Base wells. The potable water system is also interconnected with the Privatized Housing water system to receive potable water from Housing or supply potable water to Housing in the event of an emergency. Tidewater Utilities Inc. supplies water to the privatized housing owned by Dover AFB Properties, Inc. and is the water commodity supplier to the interconnection point to supply Dover AFB. Dover AFB is the water commodity provider to supply water to the Privatized Housing Area in the event of an emergency through the interconnect point. 

The Dover AFB water distribution system provides potable water for the Main Base facilities and also for facilities in the Community area of the Base, which is West of State Route 1. The water distribution system crosses State Route 1 in three locations, although only two locations are still active and the other location has been abandoned and not included in the UP Solicitation. The first location is north of the State Route 1 overpass (Old Lebanon Road). This is the location of the Dover AFB and Privatized Housing water systems interconnection point (located in a common area adjacent to a play ground east of Macadamia Way in housing). The interconnection point tees off from the water main piping that continues on to the Dover AFB community area south of Old Lebanon Road. The Dover AFB main that continues on to the Community Area and traverses along Macadamia Way through the privatized housing area crossing Old Lebanon Road is included in the UP Solicitation. The second location where the Dover AFB water system crosses State Route 1 is south of Old Lebanon Road along Green Way Street and this piping is also included in the UP Solicitation.

Four wells (Wells A2, B, C2, and F) produce water from the Cheswold aquifer to support Dover AFBs water demand requirements. An additional well, Well D, produces water from the Piney Point aquifer; however, Well D is not currently used for water production because of its arsenic content and is currently isolated from the well water collection mains through a closed valve. Well D is still operated monthly to maintain the well as a sample point for the State of Delaware to test the Piney Point aquifer and is included in the UP Solicitation. Wells A2, B, and C2 are located in stand alone facilities (Facilities 644, 641, and 483 respectfully) north of the Water Plant. Wells D and F are located within Facility 612 within the Water Plant compound area. Raw well water is collected through independent raw water collection mains that traverse from Wells A2, B, C2, and F to the Water Plant (Facility 610) where the water is treated with sodium hypochlorite as the chlorination strategy before entering the 1,000,000 gallon ground storage reservoir located within the fenced Water Plant compound area.  The Water Plant compound includes a pump station within Facility 610 that has four pumps to supply potable water to the distribution system and the 250,000 gallon elevated water storage tank (Facility 223).

Wells A2, B, and C2 are supplied backup power from standalone emergency generators located at each of the well facilities. Wells D and F are connected to the backup power from the emergency generator located within the Water Plant compound area that serves the entire compound. 

The water distribution system also includes one recirculation pump station (Facility 123). The pump station reduces the stagnation and low chlorine residual by providing additional chlorination with sodium hypochlorite and circulating water from the southern portion of the Base.

A SCADA system is used to monitor the water system. The SCADA system is included in the UP Solicitation of the water distribution system.
PVC is the material of choice for water-line replacement. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or marking tape with PVC piping mains. Water mains are typically installed with a 6 foot average burial depth and approximately 10 percent of the system is underneath paved surfaces.

<DESC>The mission of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), DCTD, NCI centers on the discovery and preclinical development of agents with clinical anticancer potential. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are an early and integral part of the overall drug development process and contract resources for preclinical development studies have existed in DTP continuously since the late 1970s. Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>

Space constraints on existing DoD vehicles mandate thatany performance improvements result in minimum impact on the existing CREWsystem's footprints.  Accordingly, DoD requires an integrated single boxCREW system capable of operating through "Band C" that is ready forimmediate production. 
ITT has developed an upgrade kit which integrates with the existing CVRJ toprovide the required performance improvements.  No data package currently exists for this requirement.  The Navy hascompleted required testing on the upgraded CVRJ kit and determined it isready for production and fielding.

Research funded by this task will focus on addressingthe capacity challenges facing the US national airspace. It has been forecast that overthe next 15 years, air traffic in the United States will double, far exceeding thecountrys current capability to safely fly aircraft. To handle this growth, NASA iscontributing to the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation ManagementSystem (NextGen).In support of these efforts, the UARC will investigate new approaches to safelyincreasing the number of aircraft that can operate in the national airspace at any giventime.  More specifically, air traffic management research funded by this task will focuson developing simulation capabilities, such as creating appropriate test scenarios,integrating the appropriate hardware and software, and managing human-in-the-loopsimulations themselves, in order to demonstrate more efficient approaches to schedulingaircraft arrivals in the congested airspace near major airports. The Aligned ResearchProgram work covered by this award is entitled, Algorithms for Efficient Approaches toScheduling Aircraft Arrivals Prior to Entering TRACON.This award notice is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The task order is issued under anexisting Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract NAS2-03144, which was made on a competitive basis.Due to the variability of this research and development work a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee taskorder was determined appropriate.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs Alaska Medical & R.O. Center

2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of the signage and cabling hardware and installation services for the new VA Medical Center, 102 N. Muldoon Rd, Anchorage AK.

      Q-Matic Corporation
      95 Underwood Rd.
      Fletcher, NC 28732
      1-828-209-1000

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  This procurement is for the signage and cabling hardware required to be relocated and installed the electronic ticket machine system into the new VA Medical Center. The Q-Matic technician will shutdown, disassemble, move, re-cable, and reconfigure the system in the new location.  They will certify that the system is working correctly.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. 

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market by submitting a sources sought notice through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors are authorized to offer this service.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $5,336.63.  I have reviewed past PO's to determine price reasonableness.  P.O. 463-A70107 for $21,642.04 was to procure the entire Q-Matic ticket system and installation. We are paying approximately 25% for the removal and reinstallation into a new VA Medical Center. The price is determined to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Q-Matic Corporation is the only authorized dealer to work on this system. 

9.	Other Considerations:  Each Q-Matic installation is unique with custom configurations, with the many different components requiring different types of cabling and wiring (i.e. passive).  Any modifications done to the system by unauthorized personnel will void warranty coverage.  Q-Matic cannot promise that damage done due to improper shutdown; disassembly and reconfiguration can be repaired, and may require all new components and cabling.  

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market by submitting a sources sought notice through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors are authorized to offer this service.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
