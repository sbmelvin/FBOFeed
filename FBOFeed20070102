<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for Component Space Qualification Needs
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), regarding the need for spacecraft component space qualification.  

BACKGROUND.  During the early years of the US Space Program numerous component development secondary payloads were launched.  As the space industry has matured, the frequency and availability of secondary payload launches to support space component R&D has been significantly reduced.  The resulting reduction in the rate of space component qualification can have a negative impact on the development of future spacecraft systems.   

DARPA is soliciting information regarding specific existing and under development components for future spacecraft systems that are not available for space use today due to lack of space qualification.  Increased availability of secondary payload launch opportunities in the US could facilitate more rapid space component qualification.  In the near term, this increased availability of launch opportunities is of benefit only if a sufficient number of relevant component technology payloads exist in the development or "ready for flight testing" status.  

The objective of this RFI is to identify relevant space components that need to be qualified to Technology Readiness Level 7 (TRL-7). TRLs are a systematic metric/measurement system that supports assessments of the maturity of a particular technology and the consistent comparison of maturity between different types of technology.  
[John C. Mankins, Advanced Concepts Office, Office of Space Access and Technology, NASA White Paper, April 1995].  TRL-6 consists of a system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. TRL-7 consists of a system prototype demonstration in a space environment, which requires space launch of the component as a secondary or embedded payload.  

Further background information on this topic is at www.darpa.mil/STO/Solicitations/RFI-SN07-13

This RFI solicits inputs from two classes of organizations; (A) current space bus developers who foresee the need for improved versions of existing components, and (B) component developers who have innovative concepts that may enhance our ability to accomplish current or new space missions.  DARPA solicits potential payload users and developers to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the government in determining whether a separate solicitation should be released to augment current capabilities for space component qualification.  DARPA requests that submittals describe briefly and clearly the component and applicable host spacecraft or class of host spacecraft, and comment on the expected benefits to be achieved through space testing and qualification of the proposed component payload.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Based on the results of this RFI, the Government may choose to issue a formal solicitation during calendar year 2007 for "Rideshare Opportunities for Space Component Testing"

RESPONSES.  

Responses should be submitted in the format provided at https://www.darpa.mil/STO/Solicitations/RFI-SN07-13/index.html. 

All responses must be unclassified.  Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such.  Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts from Schafer Corporation of Arlington, VA and Rubicon Corp, of Burke, VA, who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information.  RFI responses should be received no later than COB Jan 26, 2007.   Due to the large volume of responses expected, DARPA will not acknowledge receipt of submissions.

All questions (technical, contractual, administrative) pertaining to this BAA must be submitted to DARPA at the following e-mail address: RFI-SN07-13@darpa.mil
