Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in it's solicitation for this item. The required quantity is a total of 1015 units with a 100% option, 864 units to be shipped to (W25G1U) DLA Distribution DDSP New Cumberland Facility, New Cumberland, PA 17070-5002 and 151 units to be shipped to (W62G2T) W1BG DLA Distribution, Tracy, CA 95304-5000..

Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 150 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for engineering/technical expertise and system engineering modifications for the WAM surveillance system. The WAM system is technically unlike any other commercial surveillance system in production and includes proprietary hardware/software components that cannot be modified by the FAA.
This contract will provide engineering phone support, technical interchange meetings (TIMs), technical support at WAM sites, engineering studies, and modification development.  The purpose is to sustain WAM service and/or redundancy of the WAM service in the NAS.  The WAM program goal is to provide engineering services for the development of future (and presently unforeseen) WAM system modifications.
Sensis Corporation, East Syracuse, NY, developed and produced the WAM surveillance system and retains proprietary control of critical components in the WAM subsystem.  An Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract for one year with options to renew for four additional 1-year periods is contemplated.  
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Sensis Corporation, East Syracuse, NY, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<p>SUBJECT: Vacuum Chamber</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB683020-13-00700</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: December 18, 2012</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, 301-975-6205<br />Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, 301-975-8802</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with RHK Technology of Troy, Michigan for the Production of a Vacuum Chamber under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>*** NIST cites the following as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Surface and Nanoscale Metrology Group at NIST owns a Pan Style Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) from RHK Technology, Troy , Mi. It is used for developing atomic scale dimensional standards based on atomic scale lithography on silicon surfaces. The STM is fully customized to the requirements of the project. NIST requires a vacuum chamber to install the STM with appropriate ports to match the viewing angles on the STM. The chamber must be fully compatible with the RHK STM. RHK is the only company that can produce the vacuum chamber in a timely manner. Any other company would necessitate design work and cause undue difficulties and delays for NIST.</p>
<p>As a result RHK Technology is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on December 18, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to compete a requirement entitled "The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Home Visit Program (HHVP)." This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures using NAICS Code 541990 and FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, multi-year, type contract will be awarded with a three (3) year period of performance. It is expected that a solicitation will be issued on or about December 17, 2012.
<p><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />This procurement shall acquire the services of a contractor to perform home-based medical evaluations for HANDLS participants who are unable to visit the NIA's Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for their follow-up medical evaluations. This HANDLS sub-study is called the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). Initially, the NIA will require approximately 50 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved. Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because HANDLS was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the procurement are: (1) to perform follow-up study evaluations on all HHVP participants identified by the Government; (2) create, implement, and manage a database tracking system for classifying all HHVP participants. The database will provide complete verification of the status of HANDLS home visit participants and shall include information indicating who are active and willing to participate, who completed a home visit, who have died, and who refuse the home visit (as they occur), and also up-to-date demographic and contact information for all home visit participants; (3) Increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring" (non-random missing data); (4) Expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial co-morbidity and disability.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>This requirement was previously publicized under sources sought notice nos. HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-12-171 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-12-171.</p>

Raytheon is the only contractor capable of developing the DDG-1000 FMB including developing the tactical software that runs the DDG-1000 bridge consoles.  Raytheon has the unique knowledge required to develop a simulated bridge that is both integrated with the DDG-1000 tactical software and accurately simulates DDG-1000 capabilities and functionality.  DDG-1000 bridge and tactical software is still being developed by Raytheon and up to date technical data and tactical software is not available to contractors outside of Raytheon, nor to the Government to provide the software as GFE to another contractor.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 A Solicitation is not available at this time. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Agency. Inquiries concerning this synopsis should be submitted IN WRITING via electronic mail to the Contract Specialist, Mr. David Kors, at david.kors@navy.mil.

Major areas of support include: continued Modification, Maintenance, and Configuration Control of the NATO Improved Link Eleven (NILE) IT Products including: the System Network Controller (SNC) Software, the NILE Reference System (NRS) software and Hardware, and associated documentation. SNC/NRS enhancements due to potential new system capabilities (such as new waveforms) implementation are also expected to be execute under this contract. The impact evaluation of software changes to NILE IT Products (executed under the provisions of this contract) on the Multi-Link System Test and Training Tool (MLST3) is an additional contract requirement.  A delivery of an updated baseline, labeled "Block Cycle" as a result of combined analysis, design and implementation activities may be required every two contractual years. Furthermore engineering and project management services are also required as part of this contract.  Engineering support will include (1) execution of interoperability testing between Link 22 system devices developed by different vendors and evaluation of results and (2) providing expertise to the NILE PMW or to the Government committed to maintain proper system level integration and compatibility throughout the concurrent MLLC Full Development (FD) effort.  Program management support will include establishment of an effective project management structure to oversee execution of tasks directed by this PWS and to provide life cycle support and configuration management of the IT Products delivered.
Based on the results of market research, this procurement will not be a small business set aside.  This requirement limits competition to prime and first-tier subcontractors from the seven (7) NILE nations.  The estimated maximum FTE equivalent based on 2,080 hours per work-year is between 9-14 FTEs per year. SPAWAR intends to issue a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a base year, two one-year options, and two one-year award terms, for a total possible period of performance of five years.

<a href="mailto:kimberly.b.pumyea@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting contractors for maintenance dredging at Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River in ME and NH.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued in on or about 20 August 2012.  The construction window for dredging activities is between December 1, 2012 and March 15, 2013.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.<br><br>The project involves maintenance dredging and advance maintenance dredging to remove a total of about 15,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from the authorized 35 foot deep channel in the Piscataqua River. The work involves removal of 3 distinct, relatively small shoal areas within the Simplex Reach. Advance maintenance dredging to -40' Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2' allowable over-depth dredging will be performed on the primary shoal located adjacent to the Tyco Integrated Systems Company wharf (i.e. formerly the Simplex Wire and Cable Co. dock). Maintenance dredging to -35' MLLW plus 2' of allowable over-depth (i.e. 37' below MLLW) will be performed on the other two shoals; one located upstream of the primary shoal and one located downstream of the primary shoal. The dredged material will be placed at a previously-used, in-river disposal area, located about 3,000' seaward of the dredging area. Because of the dynamic nature of the area, it is anticipated that it will be necessary for the contractor to dredge to the allowable depths (i.e. -42' and -37' respectively) to positively clear the required depths of<br>-40' and -35' below MLLW. The dredging window for this work is 1 Dec -15 Mar. Due to uncertain weather conditions and potential ice flows in the river, we are targeting the beginning of the dredging window to complete the work.<br><br>The Piscataqua River has one of the swiftest tidal currents of all of the commercial waterways in the U.S. Tidal currents can exceed 5 knots. Any dredging work is inherently dangerous, but it is especially critical when working during the winter months in relatively deep water, against swift tidal currents and around high vessel traffic that is involved in the transport of hazardous cargos in a densely populated area such as the international port of Portsmouth. The Contractor will be required to conduct the work in such a manner as to not obstruct navigation, and the contractor's plant will be required to be moved on the approach of any vessel to such an extent as may be necessary to afford a practicable passage.<br><br>The solicitation will be available on or about 20 August, 2012 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/www.fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.

<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on vendors that are capable of providing upgrades to the existing MST Toxic Gas Monitoring System. The new cleanroom has an existing Toxic Gas monitoring system. This system was put into place with the older model of software. The upgrade in the software should allow us to be able to remotely control the system and to be able to look at the system from any location instead of relying on just the one computer for readouts. This would be extremely important if there were to be a gas leak or a problem with the system that would be a cause for evacuation of the building. <br /><br />This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify organizations with the requisite qualifications to meet the requirements of the items stated herein. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and compared with NIST's minimum, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334519- Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, with a small business size standard for such requirements of 500 employees. The specific purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to determine if there are small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that are capable of providing the item identified.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), and the NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Climate Program Office (CPO) have a requirement for a 5-minute video to communicate in a public-friendly manner the climate science, data, and information products that the agency provides to the public, policy leaders, and stakeholder communities. Specifically, the video should focus on the ways in which NOAA's science, data and information products are used to help scientists and the public understand the causes and effects of extreme event-caused by weather, climate, and environment-and ways in which the agency's expertise and resources can be used to help communities prepare for natural disasters so that they are less vulnerable and more resilient. The video is being produced to be featured in the January 2013 annual conference of the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) in Washington, D.C. The theme for that conference is "Disasters and Environment: Science, Preparedness &amp; Resilience."<br />The NCSE has an agreement with WebsEdge Ltd to produce all video production for the conference. NCSE will not allow outside contractors or video to be shown unless it is provided by WebsEdge and any other video production company cannot be considered. The contractor, WebsEdge Ltd. is being selected as a sole source contractor due to their unique contract status with NCSE. WebsEdge has sole and exclusive rights to produce and transmit all video content at the NCSE conference and so it is the only contractor authorized to produce and display a NOAA video in this event. All assets for this video shall be video recorded, produced, and formatted in high-definition, and delivered to NOAA CPO in a publication-ready format prior to December 31, 2012. There will be many senior and high-ranking federal officials in attendance as well as business leaders and scholars from academia and NGOs. Keynote speakers at this event include Jane Lubchenco, NOAA Administrator, Katherine Sullivan, NOAA's Chief Scientist, William Craig Fugate, FEMA Administrator, Marcia McNutt, USGS Director, and James Lee Witt, former FEMA Administrator. The event is annually attended by more than 1,500 people.<br />WebsEdge has a contract with the NCSE Conference Conveners that gives it sole and exclusive rights to produce and transmit all video content on the Science &amp; the Environment Channel at the conference. There is no other way to produce and display video at this event except via WebsEdge. To verify the Government contacted NCSE conference conveners to determine whether the Government could produce, display, and transmit video by selecting another contractor but were respectfully declined because of NCSE's current agreement with WebsEdge.<br />NOAA's CPO requires the production and display of a video at this event as an important communication tool that will be used in conjunction with presentations by the NOAA Administrator and NOAA Chief Scientist. Specifically, the video will complement their presentations and interactions with other high-ranking officials, policy leaders and decision makers across all sectors to help them understand the ways that NOAA's scientific research, data, models, and decision support tools can help them understand, plan and prepare for weather, climate and environmental disasters, and to reduce the nation's vulnerability while improving resilience. Recent events - such as Hurricane Sandy, the mid-Atlantic derecho, and the widespread extreme drought conditions across most of the nation - underscore why NOAA's science expertise, data and resources are needed by others to help them understand, plan and prepare. This video will be an effective tool for conveying this important information to high-ranking decision makers across all sectors.<br />One of the key aims of the video programming at the NCSE conference is to raise the visibility across the federal government, non-governmental organizations, business and academic sectors of scientific research and best practices in disaster preparedness, emergency management &amp; resilience. Production and display of a video about NOAA's world-leading research in weather, climate and the environment-and the ways in which NOAA leverages its data and decision-support tools for disaster preparedness and to help communities and decision makers improve their resilience-will help NOAA strengthen and build upon its important partnerships across the federal government, the business community, academia, and NGO stakeholders.<br />The contractor will collect video footage for production, and deliver to CPO a 5-minute feature video. The work will include two days of filming with the film crew on up to two separate locations to capture the required interviews, visuals, comments, testimonial and case study material, plus 1 or 2 additional interviews at WebsEdge Ltd.'s Washington, D.C. production office. All video will be shot in Full High Definition format. NOAA CPO will retain the rights to all assets produced and delivered by WebsEdge Ltd. so that the CPO has unlimited ability to repurpose, repackage, and republish any or all of these materials.<br />&raquo; NOAA's video will be viewable on a dedicated cable channel in designated official delegates' hotel rooms as well as online on the NCSE conference website &amp; our WebsEdge Government YouTube channel. &raquo; WebsEdge has exclusive rights to providing large TV display screens at strategic locations in the conference venue which will play NOAA's video (and others') on a continuous loop throughout the conference. &raquo; WebsEdge will incorporate NOAA's video into the "fabric" of the conference agenda by playing it at select times on TV monitors and display screens during the conference to maximize its exposure, relevance, and effectiveness in conveying NOAA's story. &raquo; NOAA's video will be broadcast on the NCSE conference website &amp; on the WebsEdge Government YouTube channel for at least 12 months after the conference to a much wider audience of stakeholders across the U.S. and internationally. &raquo; Copies of NOAA's video will be made available on request to conference attendees.<br />This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to WebsEdge Ltd., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice The NAICS code for this action is 512110. Responses may be sent to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 757-664-3622 ATTN: Karen Christian. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Government must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). Contractors previously registered must be active in the SAM. The SAM is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities in Central Contractor's Registry (CCR), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), Fed Regulations, and Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).

<DESC>Request for Information for a More Sustainable SLD Monitoring and Control Solution for Radiation Detection Systems<br />1.0 Purpose<br />The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Second Line of Defense (SLD) Program is seeking industry input on a simpler, more sustainable Monitoring and Control solution for new and deployed Radiation Detection Systems. <br />2.0 Background<br />The SLD Program Mission is to assist partner countries to develop, maintain, and sustain their capacity to deter, detect, and interdict illegal trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials through international border crossings, airports, seaports and other points of entry. The SLD Program provides an integrated, sustainable radiation detection system (RDS) to monitor international trade routes and minimize the risk of nuclear proliferation and nuclear materials-related terrorism. At a high level, the RDS performs these functions: <br />1. Detecting nuclear and radioactive materials.<br />2. Capturing an image or images for the purpose of identifying the occupant at the time of the alarm.<br />3. Monitoring equipment messages for alarm events and collecting the output of radiation detection and ancillary equipment as well as capturing state of health of this equipment (faults).<br />4. Processing alarm events by presenting data to the operator along with a means to process alarms.<br />5. Maintain and Retaining Alarm Event Data to support non-real-time oversight and analysis of operations.<br />Functions 3, 4, and 5 together make up the Monitoring and Control solution.<br />To date, the program has deployed a range of vendor solutions. The current solutions have been very capable in satisfying operations from the very simplest implementation (a single lane and a single workstation) to a very active container seaport with multiple lanes with hundreds, if not thousands, of transits of shipping containers per day. However, these installations can be very expensive to maintain and operate.<br />3.0 Desired Outcomes<br />The SLD Program seeks information on a Monitoring and Control solution, addressing functions 3 through 5 above, including suggestions, technology, architecture, or processes that will:<br />1. Reduce initial acquisition cost of any monitoring and control hardware and software.<br />2. Minimize the sustainability costs (management and operations, maintenance, and training) to both the SLD Program and, ultimately, the partner countries.<br />3. Maximize the likelihood of partner countries' ability to sustain, maintain, integrate, and further develop the system indigenously.<br />4. Reduce sensitivity of the any monitoring and control hardware and software to environmental conditions.<br />5. Have a scalable solution that can satisfy the vast majority of installations (simple) but can also be scaled to support operations of high-volume sites (including airports and large container ports).<br />6. Have a solution that maintains data integrity of all data captured as well as providing a means to secure the solution from inadvertent damage, or intentional malicious acts.<br />4.0 Responses to this RFI should not exceed 10 pages and should contain the following information:<br />4.1 Vendor information including name, address, and point of contact.<br />4.2 Vendor size, socio-economic status, and whether it is U.S. based.<br />4.3 Suggestions and/or solutions on architecture, technology, or other potential elements to assist the SLD program in achieving the stated outcomes.<br />4.3.1 Discuss how your solution minimizes the cost of initial infrastructure improvements as well as retrofit and long term sustainability costs. <br />4.4 Availability of technology (HW, SW, and or Firmware) or other suggested solutions.<br />4.4.1 For readily available technology describe where and how it is used and how it is supported.<br />4.4.1.1 Include in your discussion experience of system operational availability and frequency of repair/ time to repair of the top three failure modes.<br />4.4.1.2 Include in your discussion the minimum technical level of individuals required to support the technology including maintenance.<br />4.4.1.3 Discuss your upgrade strategy for your solution. What is the expected life-cycle of the system components?<br />4.4.1.4 Discuss any licensing costs and/or maintenance costs required.<br />4.4.1.4.1 Discuss your ability and willingness to transfer configurations and software code to SLD partners.<br />4.4.2 If not commercially available, briefly discuss how and how long it would take to develop, test, and make available the required technology, and how you would envision it being supported.<br />4.4.2.1 Discuss your ability and willingness to transfer configurations and software code to SLD partners.<br />4.5 Marketing material if available may be included but should not be used to satisfy the response unless it specifically provides the above information and clearly demonstrates how it can help the SLD Program achieve the desired outcomes.<br />4.6 All responses must be unclassified.<br />4.7 Responses including proprietary information should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary information clearly marked as containing "proprietary data."<br />6.0 Responses are required by December 21, 2012. Both email and mail submittals will be accepted. Please send email to: Geary.Pyles@nnsa.doe.gov ; Debra.Moone@nnsa.doe.gov. Mailed responses should be sent to: U.S. department of Energy; Attn:Debra Moone, NA-256, 1000 Independence Ave., SW, Washington DC 20585.<br />7.0 Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by email to: Geary.Pyles@nnsa.doe.gov ; Debra.Moone@nnsa.doe.gov. Verbal questions will not be accepted.<br />8.0 Summary<br />This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide RDS Monitoring and Control capability. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN IVITATION TO BID, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERMENET TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COST INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Department of Energy has not made a commitment to procure any of these items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.

In meeting these goals, OIT ESE strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.

OIT ESE Integrated Campus Support (ICS) Division has a continuing requirement to store backup media of all OIT ESE ICS IM/IT systems off site to preserve its integrity and to prevent damage from fire, water or accidental erasure.  There is also a continuing requirement (referred to as the Litigation Hold Memo) to store for an indefinite period of time all backup tapes for litigation purposes.  VA has a continued need for additional offsite physical storage space and transportation services for storing weekly backup media and media subjected to Litigation Hold Memos.

This approach shall include a rough timeline of transition.  The contractor shall perform this transition while maintaining the integrity of the media and its chain of custody, and inventory control of all media.  During the transition period accessibility to the media shall be uninterrupted.  A general explanation if OIT ESE will experience any downtime of accessibility to the media tapes during the transition period.
(3) The offeror shall provide evidence that they are able to store the media in facilities that are within four hours of the designated VA facilities in the PWS and that the facilities are fireproof, water proof, and secure.  The offeror must also provide evidence that facilities comply with storage requirements set forth in 36 CFR Part 1234.
(4) The response shall include a brief discussion concerning the inventory tracking system that the offeror would utilize to meet the requirements of the PWS.
(5) The page limit for the response is 20 pages.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for a Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction System as a part of an overall ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system for the purpose of determining surface quality of InSb and CdTe surfaces in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system and to monitor growth rate through RHEED intensity oscillations. . The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. <br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The Government requires a RHEED System with computer controlled beam rocking. The only known source that can meet the Government's requirements is Staib Instruments, Inc. <br /><br />Beam rocking is a necessary feature which allows precise aiming of the electron beam onto the sample which cannot be accomplished through beam translation alone. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in CCR prior to award for solicitations issued after 21 May 1998. You may contact CCR at 1-888-CCR-2423, fax at 1-703-696-0213.

<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,  Columbia Cascades Area Office,intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with GeoEngineers in accordance with FAR 6.302, the proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)( 1_ ) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) In 2011 Reclamation entered into a contract with the Talent Irrigation District (TID) to develop a PHABSIM/HEC-RAS habitat model to estimate the habitat uplift that was possible through the placement of Large Woody Material (LWM) in streams that were affected by the operation and maintenance activities of the Rogue River Basin Project in Southwest, Oregon.  This LWM modeling report would be used to document how Reclamation could calculate the amount of habitat benefit of LWM placement during the Rogue Project Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).   TID authorized GeoEngineers Inc. to conduct this habitat uplift analysis in one particular reach of Emigrant Creek.  On February 28, 2012 GeoEngineers Inc. delivered a final report to Reclamation entitled "Emigrant Creek Habitat Uplift Analysis: A Synthesis of Two Models (PHABSIM and HEC-RAS) to Quantify LWD Habitat Value".  This report was then subsequently delivered to NMFS as part of Reclamation's habitat analysis for the ESA consultation process for the Rogue Project. On April 2, 2012 Reclamation received a final Biological Opinion (BiOp) from NMFS for the continued operation of the Rogue Project.  As part of this BiOp, NMFS directed Reclamation to conduct LWM habitat modeling in additional reaches of both Bear and Little Butte Creeks that are affected by Rogue Project operations.  Using the Reclamation Workflow Management Process (Reclamation's Business Model), the Columbia-Cascades Area Office (CCAO) offerred the LWM habitat analysis project for these additional stream reaches to the Regional Office in Boise, ID.  The River Systems Analysis Group (RSAG) in the Regional Office elected to conduct the habitat modeling for these other reaches and as a result, the CCAO entered into a Service Agreement with the RSAG to complete the habitat modeling in May of 2012. The RSAG conducted their LWM modeling analysis between June through September 2012.  During this process, however, the RSAG was not able to accurately reproduce the results that were obtained from the February 28, 2012 GeoEngineers Report for the Emigrant Creek reach.  After several meetings between the CCAO, RSAG, and staff from GeoEngineers Inc., it was determined that the various modeling approaches used by the RSAG and GeoEngineers Inc. were essentially the same and were both accurate.  However, the GeoEngineers Inc. modeling report was presented in different values (habitat uplift in ft2 per 1000 ft of stream channel) rather than as a habitat value of ft2 per individual LWM structure as was reported by the RSAG.  Because different approaches were used to report the habitat uplift results, the reports appear to be inconsistent with one another, when in fact, they are essentially the same. Because the reports should represent habitat uplift in a similar manner, Reclamation has requested that GeoEngineers Inc. re-analyze their habitat model to represent the habitat uplift in ft2 per structure rather than ft2 per 1000 ft of stream channel.   GeoEngineers was also asked to provide a memorandum and new results table that explains why the habitat model was changed and why the results were altered from the original report from February 28, 2012.  

The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished, insufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business December 12, 2012, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Goverment not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Goverment. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted by electronic mail at cmorgan@usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma, Arizona, 85364, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis as provided under FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements with Imperial Irrigation District, 333 E. Barioni Blvd, Imperial, CA 92251. The requirement is for procurement of electrical power for the operation of the YAO water wells and the Water Storage Reservoir facilities located in the Imperial Valley.
The Imperial Irrigation District is the only supplier of electrical power within the Imperial Valley.

Not operating these facilities would result in reduced water savings and violation of Minute 242 of the 1944 Treaty with Mexico.  Reclamation would also be in violation of numerous water contracts with the various water districts and state agencies.   
The NAICS Code for this action is 21122 Electric Power Distribution with a Small Business Size Standard of 4 million megawatt hours.
This procurement will be awarded using FAR Part 41, Acquisition of Utility Services, Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items with an intended performance period of one year.  Anticipated award date is December 31, 2012.   
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. 
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made available for public inspection as required by FAR 6.305.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued. This requirement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is code 333314, Size Standard 500 employees.
<p><br />Solicitation number F2KBAD2212A002-2 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62, Effective 20 Nov 2012.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the following:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: High Sensitivity Optical Imager<br />DESCRIPTION: Keo Sentry 4" Scientific Imager, 8 position filterwheel, Pixis 2048B eXcelon.</p>
<p>The optical imager must meet the following specifications:<br /><br />&bull; 1" or larger scientific grade-1 back-illuminated bare CCD detector with 2000x2000 or more pixels with 16 bit digitization. Peak quantum efficiency of 95% or better, with QE above 50% over the range of 400-700 nm and thermoelectric cooling to -70C or better, with lifetime guaranteed vacuum sealed chamber. Readout speed of 1 MHz or better, with 12 e- readout noise or better and dark current of 2e-3 e-/pix/sec or less. Detector shall be capable of on-chip binning to 256x256 super-pixels.<br /><br />&bull; Overall sensitivity of 10 Rayleigh or better<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric optics providing an effective f/# at the detector of 1.0 or less and narrow-band (2nm or less) filtering on the front end, matched efficiently to 4" filters on front end<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric front end optics compatible with 4" diameter narrow-band filters with 2 nm bandwidth and efficiently matched to detector optics <br /><br />&bull; Swappable front end optics providing the following fields of view: 15, 30, 60, and 90 degrees <br /><br />&bull; Automated computer-controlled temperature-stabilized filter wheel capable of holding 8 4"-diameter filters<br /><br />&bull; Automated integrated imager and filter wheel control software allowing pre-programmed automated operation and remote network access<br /><br />&bull; 2-nm passband 4" filters appropriate for observing emissions at the following wavelengths: 427.8, 557.7, 630.0, and 777.4 nm<br /><br />&bull; Automated high-reliability shutter with automatic light protection sensor<br /><br />&bull; High-speed USB interface<br /><br />&bull; Turn-key completely integrated system (front end optics, shutter, filter wheel, telecentric stages, re-imaging optics, and detector all mechanically secured to stand-alone chassis) optimized for observations of faint upper atmospheric phenomena. System shall be fully portable, weigh no more than approximately 100 lbs (in any one configuration-total weight including all possible front end optics and filters may be somewhat higher. 200 lbs maximum), fit within a 36"x24"x24" volume, and be sturdy enough to withstand frequent shipping and operation under field conditions without requiring realignment, disassembly, or reassembly. "Field conditions" refers to operation at remote sites with minimal infrastructure or support from trained personnel, typically from inside portable shelter with some climate control (temperature range 50-85 F) and viewing the sky through a dome. The sun shines directly onto the instrument through the dome during the day, which explains the need for an automatic light blocking shutter. The system is typically bolted to a wall or mechanically suspended from the ceiling below the dome. The area around the dome is covered with a black cloth to avoid stray light from inside the shelter getting into the lens, but the main part of the system can be expected to be exposed to at least some light during operation. A heavy system designed for a laboratory or dark room with parts of the optical train open to the room or needing an optical bench for support or alignment is not realistic. The system will operate at a single location anywhere from 2 weeks to multiple years, and generally the equipment is allowed to equilibrate to ambient conditions for 6 hours or more after opening the shipping boxes before actually operating it. No sudden temperature swings.<br /><br />&bull; System shall have mechanical mounting bracket sufficient to support weight of system in vertical or horizontal configuration. System shall be reliable enough to operate 24 hours per day for months at a time without requiring operator attention, and to be able to withstand daily operation (average 10 hours/day) for multiple years before failing or requiring replacement of mechanical components.</p>

<DESC>In support of its mission, The Western Management Development Center (WMDC) needs to acquire a contractor to deliver up to three (3) behavioral leadership assessment centers (LACs) for the purpose of providing high quality developmental feedback to Federal Senior Managers (i.e., GS-15 pay level or equivalent) on their readiness to enter the next level of leadership in the Federal Government (i.e., executive level). The LAC is a two and a half day (i.e., 20-23 hour) program, which includes time for behavioral assessment, analysis of data, and debriefing of participants. Note: Depending on the design, the behavioral assessment portion may be from 8-11 hours in length. <br /><br />The LAC shall assess ten (10) competencies needed to succeed as a first-year Federal executive. The competencies must be drawn from the list of 28 competencies that comprise OPM's Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). For more information on OPM's ECQ competencies for Federal executives, please see http://www.opm.gov/ses/recruitment/ecq.asp<br />Participants are to be debriefed on their readiness to be working at full performance level today as a Federal Executive on the competencies assessed. Participants must be provided with developmental suggestions for how to reach the next level of competency performance.<br />

<p><br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance<br />ii. Price</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of running suits, jogging suits or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of running suits, jogging suits or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of running suits, jogging suits or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The following is a requirement of the Joint Commission:  AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) RD-52 states that dialysate be tested for bacteria and endotoxin monthly.  The level of bacteria and endotoxin (LAL) that should be met is the same as that of the water system.  Also, the EPA, APHA and AWWA set standards for dental unit water lines. Also described in VA SLC policy 111.07 (available upon request).	
4.  Performance Period:  The period of performance will be one base year and four (4) one-year option years.  The base year period of performance will begin upon contract award and end on November 30, 2013.  Each option year will begin on December 1st and end on November 30th.  This contract will not extend past September 30, 2016.  This contract will not extend beyond November 30, 2017.  
5.  Type of Contract:  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract, in accordance with FAR Subpart 16.202-2. 
6.  Place of Performance: Contractor's facility
B.  CONTRACT AWARD MEETING
The contractor shall not commence performance on the tasks in this SOW until the CO has conducted a post award meeting or has advised the contractor that a post award meeting is waived.
C.  SPECIFIC MANDATORY TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES
1.	The service will include the Contractor providing labrotary testing to monitor water and dialysate in accordance with industry accepted procedures applicable to such laboratory services and pursuant to manufacturer standards.

2.	VA personnel will take samples of the water and dialysate periodically during the month and will refrigerate the samples immediately.

3.	Multiple samples may be taken at one time which will constitute a batch.  Batch size may vary from month to month.

4.	VA personnel will arrange for transportation of the refrigerated samples to the Contractor.

5.	The Contractor will conduct LAL Kinetic Turbidimetric tests on samples provided by the Renal Dialysis department to determine the levels of endotoxins present.  

6.	The Contractor will conduct Microbial tests on the samples to determine Bacterial and Pyrogen levels present.  

7.	When a positive test is encountered, the Contractor shall contact the point of contact immediately at the VA so a STAT sample can be taken and delivered to the Contractor for immediate re-test for confirmation of the positive test result.

8.	Normal test results shall be reported to the VA within 48 hours of results.

<DESC>QUESTION: The 350 L/S turbo molecular pump has a nominal 8" diameter inlet<br />port.<br />Pumping at high vacuum is greatly enhanced with an unobstructed "line of<br />sight" between the pump inlet and the vacuum chamber. It would be good<br />vacuum design practice to include a min. 6" diameter to max 8" diameter<br />access hole in one of the thermal shroud plates to enhance the pumping speed<br />of the turbo pump. Can I assume that in addition to the 12" X 12" opening<br />for the solar test unit in the shroud wall plate I can also include the 6"<br />to 8" diameter opening for the turbo pump inlet and one small 1" diameter<br />opening for the vacuum measurement gauges?
<p>ANSWER: Yes, you may assume that in addition to the 12" X 12" opening<br />for the solar test unit in the shroud wall plate you may also include the 6"<br />to 8" diameter opening for the turbo pump inlet and a small 1" diameter<br />opening for the vacuum measurement gauges.</p>

<p>The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p><br />(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each company Point of Contact.<br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>d. Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance<br />ii. Price</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of flight caps, service caps, parade caps, officer flight caps or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

<p><br /><br />(3) The government reserves the right to make available not more than 10% of the GFM in short pieces. The contractor shall cut and use the short pieces furnished and/or generated and not retain them for return to the government at completion of the contract. Only the types of materials listed above will be made available to the contractor by the government. The contractor shall furnish all other types of materials in the performance of this contract.<br />(4) The contractor shall maintain adequate property control records in accordance with sound industrial practice and shall make such records available to the government inspection at all reasonable times. The contractor shall return all GFM not consumed in production to the U.S. Air Force Academy along with, or prior to, final delivery, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.<br />(5) All amount of GFM consumed in excess of the allowance per garment will be charged to the contractor at the per yard cost rate shown at (a) (1).</p>
<p>(b) Irreparable Rejects. The contractor agrees to purchase any or all irreparable rejects when notified in writing by the Contracting Officer, or his/her duly authorized representative, at the per yard rate for that particular garment as shown at (a)(1) above. The contractor shall remove or obliterate all labels referring in any way to the government, all other identification and all military insignia and ornamentation.</p>
<p>(c) Purpose of GFM: The contractor warrants that any fabric obtained from the government is required for use in connection with the garments to be furnished under this contract.</p>
<p>(d) Responsibility for GFM: The contractor assumes the risk of, and is responsible for, any loss or damage to GFM regardless of the cause, from the time the fabric is delivered to the contractor to the time it is returned to the government. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to obtain such insurance, as he/she may deem necessary, at his/her own expense.</p>
<p>(e) Deficiency or Delay in Furnishing GFM: The delivery or performance dates for the supplies to be furnished by the contractor under this contract are based upon the expectation that the GFM will be available for delivery to the contractor within the specified time. In the event the GFM is not available for delivery to the contractor by such time, the Contracting Officer will, if requested by the contractor, make a determination of the delay.</p>
<p>(1) In the event the contractor believes that damages or defective GFM, exclusive of normal imperfections, has been furnished, or in the event of shortages, narrow widths, or other discrepancies, the contractor shall immediately notify, in writing, the damage, defect, or discrepancy to the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall not cut or use such Government Material, or in the event the damaged, defect, or discrepancy is such that it could not reasonably have been discovered until after cutting or further processing, the contractor shall not further process the Government material until instructions have been received from the CO. If replacement is to be made, the government will replace at its own expense, including transportation costs, any such damaged or defective material. If the contractor fails to notify the CO within five (5) days of discovery of any defect or discrepancy in the GFM, no equitable adjustment will be made in the delivery or performance dates, or the contract price.</p>
<p>(2) In cases of delay or failure to furnish any or all of the GFM, or in case the government has furnished damaged or defective material, the CO, upon written request of the contractor, shall equitably adjust the delivery or performance period, or the contract price or both. The Government may, at its option, require sworn statements in support of such a request for an equitable adjustment. If the contractor does not request such an adjustment within 30 days from the time the contractor either knew or should have known of any such delay or deficiency in the GFM, no adjustment will be made. Under no circumstances will the Government include as an element of any adjustment under this "Explanatory Note" any amount for loss of prospective profits. Further, the provisions for adjustment are exclusive, and the Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract by reason of any delay or deficiency in furnishing GFM to the contractor.</p>
<p>(3) Fabric containing normal deficiencies shall not be considered defective. Any claim for shortage within the roll shall be adjusted as follows: for shortages on individual pieces only, credit will be taken by the Government for the minus tolerance provided for individual pieces in the "Examination for Length" paragraph of the fabric specification; for the entire shipment found to be longer than the length specified on the piece ticket. Narrow widths shall be subject to adjustment only where the discrepancy exceeds &frac14; inch. Measurements shall be "overall" or "exclusive of selvage", in accordance with the width provision of the applicable fabric specification.</p>
<p><br />(f) Protection of GFM, Title, Access. The contractor shall maintain and administer, in accordance with sound industrial practice, a program for the maintenance, protection and preservation of Government material, until disposed of by the contractor in accordance with this contract. GFM shall be maintained and used only in those plants approved by the CO.

<DESC>*****THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN MODIFIED AND EXTENDED, PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT LABLED "Updated Contingency Parts List" FOR UPDATE ON THE QUANTITIES REQUESTED*****<br /><br /><br />*****The following questions have been asked regarding this solicitation:
<p>1) Section 1.2.1 of R-644-0635 describes major parts including cable harness. 1.2.1a states estimate and overhaul shall include these items. Mandatory parts for standard overhaul does not include cable harness. Does it get included in standard overhaul price or not?</p>
<p>Response: Section 1.2.1 describes the unit and what should be included when the vendor receives the item. If these items are not included in the crate we should be notified. It is not part of the standard inspection when pricing the solicitation. It is a contingency item that will be added to the overall price, if required.</p>
<p>2) Sections 3.4 ( Overhaul is intended to restore water closet to a condition equal to new.) and Section 4.9 (Standard new water closet warranty applies. ) Are you asking for the same warranty you get when a brand new unit is purchased, even though some of these units have been in service for years and not all parts are being replaced ?</p>
<p>Response: The overhaul is to bring the water closet to a like new condition. If there are parts that don't meet that requirement, they should be replaced. Section 4.9 has been modified to read "Warranty - The Contractor's standard overhaul warranty applies"</p>
<p>3) Section 3.8.3 requires a written certification the water closet was reconditioned to same standards as new when again, they have been in service for years and not all parts are being replaced?</p>
<p>Response: The water closest should be certified to a like new condition. If the vendor does not wish to so, they should state their warranty in the proposal and it will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>4) In HSCG40-13-R-11001, it states " all prices on below CLINS shall be a firm fixed price yet in CLIN 0003 it asks for the ESTIMATED cost of the overhaul?</p>
<p>Response: Please note that the solicitation states "Unless otherwise stated," should the scope of repair be outside of the standard overhaul, an estimate would be required.</p>
<p>5) Pages 6 and 7, CLIN 0004, there is only room for labor. No room for mandatory parts or other pricing.</p>
<p>Response: The Loaded Shop Labor Rate on CLin 0004 (1004, 2004, 3004, 4004) shall include the cost of labor and the total sum of all mandatory parts.</p>
<p>6) Page 7 and 8, Contingency Parts. All quantities should be one (1), per unit, except for CLIN 0004c which should be five (5) per unit. Also CLIN 0004n ( Electronic Box-Refurbished ) should be removed as all NEW parts are requested.</p>
<p>Response: See attached updated contingency parts list. For CLIN 0004n, refurbished part may be accepted, please provide cost for the item as listed on the parts list.</p>
<p>7) Mandatory Replacement Parts list PN 5828090 Disc Valve is replaced as opposed to being rebuilt. We always rebuild them in our shop.<br /><br />Response: The Disc Valve, p/n: 5828090 shall be replaced as outlined in the specification.</p>

Industry Feedback
<p>NOTE: The below was a previous request for information.&nbsp; The official solicitation has now been posted.&nbsp; <br /><br />In an attempt to better develop our solicitation we are providing a draft and the following questions to partner with industry on developing the best acquisition possible for the United States Air Force. Ultimately it is the USAF's determination how the final solicitation will be structured, which may or may not include input from the responses of industry. At this time we do not intend to answer questions, however, asking questions is not prohibited as we will use them to understand your concerns.</p>
<p>1. Please review entire solicitation, including the Statement of Work, and provide feedback for suggestions and improvement or identify confusing language. Please provide Document Title, Page Number, and if possible, paragraph number to assist in our identifying and understanding your reference.</p>
<p>2. Request review of CLINS/Bid Schedule on draft solicitation and compare to the Alternate bid schedule and provide merits/disadvantages of each?</p>
<p>3. CLIN X002 in the Alternate Bid Schedule, if we make this firm fixed priced for general operation of the COCESS store on Seymour-Johnson, removing risk from a contractor, would this substantially lower the pricing of the products (mark-ups) purchased under CLIN 0001?</p>
<p>4. The SOW para 1.5.1.20 requires "the ability to provide the government the actual price paid by the contractor backed up by the actual vendor invoices." Would there be any additional cost associated with providing this data? If so, what?</p>
<p>4a. How would you structure the CLINS to alleviate the need for this information and rely on comparison to other industry providers?</p>
<p>4b. Is this a normal Commercial Practice?</p>
<p>5. Draft evaluation factors are included; please provide feedback and constructive rationale for making any changes?</p>
<p>6. Is any information missing that would be beneficial to providing a bid, removing risk and/or assist in the Government receiving a lower price?</p>
<p>7. Once the solicitation is released, how many days would you need to provide a proposal?</p>
<p>8. If you're a large business, what area's and what percentage of the contract is it feasible to subcontract to Small Business?</p>

They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population.  <br>    <br>  The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements.  <br>

<RESPDATE>122012
<CONTACT>Maria S Shamburger, Email HEG9@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>LRN Proficiency Testing Program Vendor Procurement<br />Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch(LRN), Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections</p>
<p><br />Background: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) in accordance with FAR 7.104(d). The potential small business will need to demonstrate the ability to produce and distribute samples for a limited number of LRN Proficiency Testing challenges for biological threat agents to prepare clinical samples to be used for validation of LRN assays.</p>
<p>History: The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) was established by the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in accordance with Presidential Decision Directive 39, which outlined national anti-terrorism policies and assigned specific missions to federal departments and agencies. The LRN's mission is to maintain an integrated national and international network of laboratories that can respond to acts of biological or chemical terrorism and other public health emergencies. The biological component of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) is managed by the LRN program office in the Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch (LPRB), Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections (DPEI), National Center for Zoonotic and Emerging Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Office of Infectious Diseases (OID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>In order to ensure preparedness and competency with LRN procedures, LRN Member Laboratories must participate in the Proficiency Testing (PT) Program provided by LPRB. The LRN PT Program is designed to simulate real-world scenarios involving potential bioterrorism agents; requiring the preparation, packaging, and distribution of prepared biological samples in a variety of sample matrices. LRN PT challenges are distributed one to four times a year to as many as 200 LRN member laboratories. In addition, the LRN program also provides opportunities for laboratories to exercise capabilities, capacities, and testing policies through simulated exercises involving samples spoke with biological threat agents.</p>
<p>Futhermore, LRN assays undergo a rigorous validation process and large numbers of clinical samples (positive and negative) will need to be created to support this project.<br />The LPRB does not have the capacity or production capabilities to produce sufficient sample quantities to meet LRN PT Challenge, exercise or validation sample requirements.</p>
<p>Describe the work: NAICS Code 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. Production of samples for PT Challenges and exercises involves the spiking of designated environmental or clinical matrices with agents of bioterrorism, including bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Each Challenge panel contains no more than five samples and production of as many as 200 panels may be required for a PT Challenge. Each panel may contain up to 3 agents. In addition, twenty percent of the panels produced must be stored by the vendor for shipment as remediation up to 6 months after the initial PT Challenge. Vendor is responsible for shipping PT panels to participating laboratories as directed by individual task orders issued under this contract. Exercises may involve production of a large volume of samples and shipping to one or multi laboratories for testing. Samples we generally be a mix of 30% positive and 70% negative. The same biological threat agents could be spiked into clinical or environmental matrices. The range of samples needed for exercise is unknown but could be anywhere from 200-2000. Preparation of clinical samples to be used in multi-center validation studies includes procurement or fabrication of clinical samples. Some of these samples will then be spiked with agents of bioterrorism, including bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Up to 300 samples per clinical sample type may be needed. Vendor is responsible for shipping PT panels, exercise samples and clinical samples for multi-center studies to participating laboratories as directed by individual task orders issued under this contract.</p>
<p><br />The contract will include the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Sign and abide by nondisclosure agreement provided by the CDC to protect sensitivity of LRN member information, agent and testing capabilities.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide verification that all personnel working under this contract have passed a background check equivalent to the clearance required for Select Agent certification</p>

<p>&bull; Follow safety practices for the manipulation of biological agents as outlined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th ed., published by the CDC, HHS, NIH</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain Select Agent Certification and allow only those personnel included on the Select Agent permit to participate in LRN PT Program sample and panel or Clinical sample production</p>
<p>&bull; Provide all raw materials, excluding biological agents, as instructed by the LPRB, for PT panel, exercise or clinical sample production</p>
<p>&bull; Provide all packaging materials for shipment</p>
<p>&bull; Package and ship PT Challenge panels, exercise samples and clinical samples to LRN Member Laboratories, nationally and potentially internationally, on date specified by the LPRB Program Officer at specified temperature (e.g. frozen, room temperature) following all shipping regulations (HHS - Select Agent Regulations 42 CFR Part 73, DOC - Export Administration Regulations 15 CFR Parts 730-744, IATA Regulations, and DOT Regulations)</p>
<p>&bull; Culture and propagate biological agent samples provided by the LPRB</p>
<p>&bull; Spike designated matrices or Clinical samples with appropriate biological agents at concentrations defined by LPRB</p>
<p>&bull; Produce number of panels for PT challenge, exercise or Clinical samples as directed by LPRB and store until designated ship date.</p>
<p>&bull; Ship sample panels to the LPRB QC Laboratory or other appointed laboratory at designated points during production for Quality Control (QC) testing</p>
<p>&bull; Reproduce PT Challenge, exercsise or Clinical samples or panels that do not pass QC testing as instructed by LPRB</p>
<p>&bull; Store 20% of PT panels produced as directed by LPRB for up to 6 months after initial PT Challenge shipment</p>

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011. <br>  <br> PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark . <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br>  <br> INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT: <br> 1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range. <br>      a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics. <br>      b.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify companies which have technologies and expertise that can be or have been applied to the Small Arms Training Task. <br>  <br> The EST II Program POR is exploring the possibilities of applying current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability.  One of the goals of this market research is to identify technical approaches which transfer the burden of marksmanship fault identification from the human instructor to the training system which could then potentially provide remediation for fault correction. <br>  <br> The current system (EST 2000) is defined as a system which is a unit / institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot), which includes Escalation of Force / graduated response scenarios. <br>  <br> Interested Sources should provide the following information: <br>  <br> 1).  Pertinent Company administrative data as to large or small business category IAW the designated NAICS.  Each Offeror is to identify whether or not the company is a STOC II prime. <br>  <br> 2).  Company history. <br>  <br> 3).  Identify company interest in the program as a Prime contractor or subcontractor to a prime.  Each Offeror is to provide recent program history (last 10 years) of company past experience in delivering small arms trainers or components of small arms trainers. <br>  <br> 4).  Identification of technologies which have potential and/or demonstrated application to the small arms training task.  Each identified technology is to be categorized by Technology Readiness Level rating system. <br>  <br> Responses to this RFI are to not exceed 15 single sided, letter-sized pages.  Font is not to be smaller than 12 points. <br>  <br> This announcement is published for market research purposed only.  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  No funds are available to pay for the preparation of responses to this announcement. <br>  <br> Submit RFI responses by 1600 Eastern Standard Time 14 June 2011, to the following email address: <br>  <br> Cori Lampe <br> Contract Specialist, SFAE-STRI-KOV <br> Email: Corisann.M.Lampe@us.army.mil <br>  <br> Comments via e-mail to the designated Contract Specialist, Cori Lampe - information listed below using the attached EST II Program POR Q&A form. <br>  <br> Questions with answers will be posted as an update to the RFI. <br>
