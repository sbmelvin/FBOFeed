<DESC>C.2.1   PROJECT  IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE

The purpose of this project is to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), its various Divisions and other components of CDC with support for disseminating information and transferring knowledge related to research, treatment and care, and prevention efforts to CDC constituents, partners and stakeholders and the general public. This shall be accomplished by providing expertise and systems for the proactive diffusion and dissemination of information and the reactive response to the needs of the NCHSTP, other CDC programs and CDC target audiences. To respond to the current user needs and to utilize state-of-the-art technology will require a major redirection in the design and operation of services of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN). The future CDC NPIN will implement and incorporate the recommendations and the findings of the NPIN Assessment Study, which is based on current user needs and CDC programmatic requirements and will remain flexible as needs and technology change.

The project will support multiple information systems on behalf of NCHSTP and other related CDC program needs.  It is a complex requirement incorporating data from federal, state, and local governments as well as private and not-for-profit sectors. It is not a traditional clearinghouse operation—these requirements involve techniques of knowledge and information transfer based on state-of-the-art technology that will afford rapid response mechanisms.  Delivery of technical assistance is a primary requirement with the goal of building capacity for transferring information and knowledge into public health practice. Information services and support must be rapid, accurate, and flexible in their delivery mechanisms, dealing with different working conditions and environments.  The project will be required to offer “value-added” products and services where research, guidelines, policies and information from CDC must be translated, summarized, organized, stored for retrieval, and disseminated in various formats, through a variety of channels, in a timely manner. 

C.3	BACKGROUND AND NEED

C.3.1   Introduction

The challenge of this procurement is to make the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) services and support a “state-of-the-art” customer-based operation that can take advantage of technology now and in the future.  For the duration of the project and beyond, the Office of Communications, NCHSTP, looks to advance the development of information services that provide:

A.	Interactivity designed to enhance partnerships, individual responsiveness, promote better communication, disseminate information, and assess professional and public information needs.

B. 	Ease of access for all.

C.	Use of current technology to broaden the range of prevention information dissemination and to reduce information-transfer costs.

D.	Networked linking and transfer of science-based health information with and to our primary audiences.

E.	Increased awareness of NCHSTP and other CDC programs that use these services and the value of their information.

F.	Adoption and utilization of NCHSTP and CDC prevention information by all of its audiences.

C.3.2  Background

The services and products of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) provide a primary mechanism for the National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) and other CDC programs to support prevention partners, stakeholders, and other constituents.  The business of CDC NPIN is knowledge/information transfer.

C.3.3  The Challenge

In the past decade, with the expanded use of the Internet as a channel for health information, there has been a proliferation of providers of information about HIV/AIDS.  The Web also offers sites for STD and TB information, although not in the volume that can be found for HIV/AIDS.  The newer technology has changed the way people access information and there has been a corresponding expansion and demand for information. 

The original mission of these services was cast in the broadest terms by the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic and by the Omnibus Legislation of 1988.  Early efforts were clearly “demand driven” as CDC NPIN and its predecessor, the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse, struggled to be responsive to all legitimate information needs and the resulting pressures of increasing demand.  The dramatic changes taking place in the dissemination of information and the increased number of sources of information, have fostered a spirit of change and a need to rethink the services and products of NPIN, to tailor them to current user needs, and to take advantage of evolving technology. In addition, the level of sophistication of NPIN audiences is heightened, and their information/knowledge needs require more depth and breadth in content areas. 

The Office of Communications (OC), NCHSTP, has the responsibility to assure close collaboration of the Center’s various information and communication efforts, along with those being undertaken by other parts of CDC.  The OC provides coordination of information services and support for NCHSTP and for other CDC users of these services.  

A customer-based assessment of the mission/purpose, audience, services, and products of NPIN was carried out in the past year.  The evaluation project offered an opportunity to determine user needs, to find out which services and products are meeting those needs and which are no longer relevant.  The competition of a contract to provide information services and support can then assure that the findings of this study be employed as guidance for the future.  Major findings of the study, conclusions and recommendations can be found at Exhibit G, Reference Materials. 

As the report indicates, this project supports multiple information systems on behalf of the NCHSTP and other CDC CIO’s.  It is a highly complex requirement incorporating data and information from the federal, state, and local governments, academia, community-based organizations, NGO’s and industry, serving a broad audience that includes health professionals and the general public.  The redirection of this project requires a wide range of personnel with varied expertise, including, but not limited to:   health care professionals, medical information specialists, database experts, systems analysts, Web designers, graphic artists, translators, inventory management specialists, librarians, health educators, and administrative personnel with experience in managing complex and demanding task-oriented projects.  The contractor must have appropriate scientific, public health, medical, health communications knowledge as well as expertise in knowledge transfer, data abstraction, data validation, technical writing, and communicating complex scientific and medical issues in terms and formats that are easily understood. 
 
In order to take advantage of new and evolving technologies and changing user needs and preferences, NCHSTP anticipates substantial changes in work requirements during the contract term.  There will be a need for transition of services as changes are made.   The Contractor should be prepared to show an understanding of the transition process—preserving the value of current services and products as new or changed ones are put in place.  CDC NPIN cannot simply “shut down” and change.  New directions must be put in place gradually and without interruption of services.

C.3.4   Customer Base

Priority targets for the services of NPIN and for communications and information efforts include state and local health agencies, community-based organizations, state and local education agencies, national and regional organizations, STD constituent clinics, training centers, the media, and academic institutions and researchers. NPIN also provides support for educational institutions, students, and business and labor organizations seeking information and assistance to deal with HIV, STD, and TB in the workplace, and to religious organizations/institutions involved in education and outreach services.

The NPIN services target partners in HIV, STD, and TB prevention.  However, the general public has access to the phone lines and the Web site.  Therefore, the information services provided must be comprehensive, flexible, and tailored where appropriate to target audiences. Marketing efforts, however, will be directed to audiences and institutions that are targeted as primary audiences, as defined by the government.  

The emphasis on the Internet and evolving technologies is a primary channel for information dissemination, requiring refocusing services as appropriate. The government is hopeful that this competition will produce a Contractor with creative ideas about how to reach target audiences and how to serve the needs of all customers of NPIN services.  The Office of Communications is also looking for creative ideas about how to monitor and assess customer satisfaction and needs in a changing technological environment.  

The CDC National HIV and STD Hotline historically have used NPIN facilities and personnel to maintain their referral database and to execute their fulfillment needs.  This requires a great deal of collaboration and coordination between contractors. In addition, NPIN has occasionally responded to information requests from members of the general public.

At some time during the life cycle of this contract, the following requirements will be transitioned to a new CDC-wide Consumer Response Contract: 

A.	Solicitation and marketing of toll-free lines to the general public,
B.	Support for toll-free lines targeting the general public in the form of a reference and referral database for use by information specialists, and
C.	Fulfillment Operations for toll-free lines in the form of storage and distribution of materials that disseminate information to the general public in response to requests for information received through the toll-free lines.

For at least the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), the CDC National HIV and STD Hotline will remain a primary customer of NPIN services—requiring maintenance of a referral database and fulfillment of orders. (See Hotline Support, under “Non-core requirements.”) Additionally, NPIN will continue to support occasional requests from the general public for the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), after which these requirements will transition to the proposed new CDC Consumer Response Contract. 
 
NPIN will continue to offer full service to its primary audiences (see C.3 Customer Base), including toll-free lines, reference and referral databases, and fulfillment operations, throughout the proposed 5-years of the contract.

C.4	Tasks

The Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the government, shall furnish the equipment, personnel, facilities, supplies, materials, and other resources necessary to develop, maintain, and operate information services and products which will furnish and provide access to HIV/AIDS, STD, TB and other information regarding preventable diseases and conditions.

The primary function of this contract will be to provide current health information services and products in support of the NCHSTP.  All resource materials produced/maintained under this contract, including databases, all information products, all data, mailing lists, Web sites, telephone protocols (Intellectual Property), etc. are the property of the Government.

<DESC>NA NOTE:  Response date of 29 August 2003 for this effort is an approximate response date.  The response date will again be referenced at the time formal solicitation is issued. This acquisition is for continued development, integration, testing, fielding and support for the Global Command & Control System-Army (GCCS-A), Maneuver Control System (MCS) and the server and infrastructure provided by the family of Common Software produ cts.  The goal for this acquisition will be to continue the development of GCCS-A, and to upgrade MCS and the associated Army Battle Command System (ABCS) infrastructure to support the joint infrastructure/joint interoperability, support Common Operating E nvironment (COE) improvements, provide for continued interoperability among joint, Army ABCS, and non digitized environments, and provide for necessary sustainment/problem resolution support for legacy products.  Principal development efforts will be orien ted toward the Global Command and Control System-Army to support new functionality and evolution in concert with the joint architecture definition defined under the evolving Network Centric Enterprise System (NCES) infrastructure/GCCS Family of Systems (FO S) architecture.  This effort will support development requirements as documented in the individual system Operational Requirements Documents and requirements emanating from ABCS overarching requirements for common infrastructure, applications and architec ture, IAW current Army guidance.  GCCS-A will continue to be developed (Blocks 4.x/5.0 and beyond) IAW their ORD requirements.  MCS and the AIS software will be upgraded to provide continuing interoperability with Joint, Coalition and other Army systems, t o incorporate COE changes and to resolve any safety issues. There is a need that will be fulfilled by this acquisition approach, to define and implement a unifying architecture/design across Army Battle Command System (ABCS) Command and Control (C2) Core systems, increase performance and leverage common application  development across programs with similar requirements.  A key objective is, through evolutionary development, to provide a more cohesive architecture and leverage common application/infrastructure products across the MCS, GCCS-A and Foundation products.  While the goal is to leverage common architecture and products across the systems, each of the individual ABCS C2 Core programs under this procurement will maintain its identity as a distinct functional product subject to individual milestone reviews/repo rting.  The program will be implemented as an evolution from the ABCS 7.0/GCCS-A Block 4.0 design for the existing products, meet individual product functional, schedule, performance and interface requirements and support transition of maintenance responsi bility for legacy products and the new system to a single contractor. This acquisition will include responsibility for management and control of the ABCS System of Systems (SoS) Engineering and Integration Effort (SSEI) that affects the ABCS architecture, SoS requirements and top-level design for the family of ABCS systems. In summary, this effort will: (1) provide for the continued software, training and fielding support as required to maintain the current GCCS-A, MCS and AIS products; (2) provide for development for the GCCS-A Blocks 4.x/5.0 and beyond; (3) provide for cont inued development of MCS and AIS software to accomplish upgrades in the areas of interoperability, Common Operating Environment (COE) and safety; (4) provide for the SSEI SoS architecture and design effort to include coordination with other ABCS developers ; (5) provide for transition of maintenance, integration and fielding responsibility from the current development/support contractors for the legacy and new baseline products defined in the Statement of Work (SOW); and (6) provide for a migration from the current architecture/design that allows for evolutionary insertion of the new, common architectur e/design/components in concert with the individual and ABCS program objectives.

<ARCHDATE>09292003
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>NA The US Army Communications-Electronics Command Acquisition Center - Washington (CAC-W) plans to award a contract to CyTerra Corp. (Waltham, MA) to support the Advanced Mine Detector (AMD) program being managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  The ob jective of this effort is an effective architecture for integration of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) technology with the Handheld Standoff Mine Detector System (HSTAMIDS).  The purpose of the integration is to satisfy the requirements of the United St ates Marine Corp (USMC) Advanced Mine Detector (AMD) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) by utilizing NQR as a confirmation sensor to reject false alarms due to clutter generated by HSTAMIDSÃ¢Â€Â™ ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic indu ction (EMI) sensor.  The goal is a mine detector operable by one Marine with the capability to rapidly detect both antitank and small antipersonnel landmines with a very high probability of detection and a very low false alarm rate.   The proposed contract  will leverage CyTerraÃ¢Â€Â™s expertise in design and manufacturing of the HSTAMIDS and require effective collaboration of CyTerra with US Navy ONR, US Army NVESD, and Quantum Magnetics (QM) (San Diego) via an Integrated Product Team (IPT).  The proposed c ontract will require CyTerra to collaborate with QM in performing the following tasks:  (a) Assess the system engineering interface issues between HSTAMIDS and NQR, especially the probe head, and develop integration concepts; (b) Perform requirements analy sis, engineering analyses, and trade studies and develop the preliminary design of the integrated HSTAMIDS-NQR architecture; and (c) Model and predict the performance of the integrated architecture.  The proposed contract will also require CyTerra to manuf acture and deliver to QM complete HSTAMIDS production units for identification of sensor interface issues and development of integration concepts.  The proposed contract will be managed for ONR by the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate .  The expected period of performance for this effort is twelve months.  It has been determined that CyTerra Corporation is the 'Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements' that is able to execute the abo ve stated effort in a timely manner.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all resp onsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above stated effort shall be considered by the agency.  Responses shall be no longer than ten (10) pages and provided in Microsoft Word compatible format.  Re sponses shall be submitted via email to pat.davis@cacw.army.mil, by the response date provided in this announcement.  The email subject line should include the phrase 'White Paper - DAAB15-03-R-0033, NQR/HSTAMIDS'.  All requests for further information mus t be in writing and via email to the above address, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response s to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<DESC>In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) will be issuing RFP ED-03-R-0015 for payment processing services.  Payment Processing is the portion of ED's accounts payable function that involves the processing of administrative payment requests for contracts, purchase cards, travel, and Inter-partnering Agency Collections (IPAC) payments.  Contract payments are the disbursement of funds to vendors (excluding purchase cards) in response to a proper request for payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of an official contract.  Purchase card payments are made monthly to the issuer of the Department's Visa cards.  Travel payments involve reimbursing ED travelers for expenses incurred while conducting official ED business.  IPAC payments involve the recording/reconciling of payments made by Treasury between ED and its partnering agencies against inter-agency agreements for goods/services.  Payment Processing is the timely and accurate authorization, approval, and issuance of funds to satisfy obligations pursuant to a proper request for payment including assurance of compliance with strict accountability policies.  The Service Provider shall make ED payments on-time, accurately match transactions, ensure accountability/auditability of payment activity, ensure system performance meets agreed-upon processing needs, verify accuracy of charges, receipt of goods or services, provide timely reconciliations, provide timely and quality management reports, provide timely receipt of payment, ensure accurate amount of payment, accurately create batch payment files, and manage Treasury confirmations of payment to ED.  The activities being competed are currently performed nation-wide at most ED locations.  Full details of the work requirements will be in the Performance Work Statement included as part of the solicitation.  In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, ED will use the tradeoff source selection process. Technical and cost proposals will be required.

Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified.  ED anticipates awarding a service provider agreement (contract, fee-for-service or letter of obligation) with a base period of one year and four one-year option periods.  A fixed-price contract type is anticipated.  This solicitation will not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous.

This work will be follow-on work to R&D efforts first introduced and performed under competitively awarded contract N00024-03-C-6101 for flexible, affordable, and innovative torpedo signal processing controls. The original programmatic requirements were competitively solicited under NAVSEA BAA N00024-02-R-6162 in July 2002 and, depending on the success of the "Phase I" contract(s), follow-on work was contemplated under "Phase II" add-on modifications to the successful offeror contract(s) with perceived technical promise. The follow-on requirements focus on additional algorithm development, model integration and processor s elf-assessments, which is likely to equate to approximately 4,000 man-hours (+/- 10%). The associated value of these follow-on efforts is estimated to be $470,000. This announcement is for informational purposes and to promote subcontracting opportunities, if they exist. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Anteon Corporation directly via Mr. Davis Sprague (Contracts) at (860) 572-9600.

<DESC>This announcement replaces the announcement for Solicitation Number SSA-RFQ-02-0397, which has been canceled.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for a qualified contractor to provide all labor, facilities, and equipment necessary for an off-site secure magnetic media vault facility for SSA's disaster recovery program for the agency's Headquarters complex located in Woodlawn (Baltimore County) Maryland area.  Magnetic tape media contains vital computer programs and data that are essential to the operation and support of SSA.  Offsite protective storage is required as a measure to preserve this vital data should a destructive event occur at the Agency's National Computer Center (NCC).  The location of the Contractor's vault facility must be within proximity of the Woodlawn complex that allows for: 1) transporting the magnetic tape media to and from SSA on a daily schedule; 2) same pickup/delivery day for the magnetic media removed from the SSA data center and received at the Contractor's vault facility; 3) recall of critical magnetic tape-based data to be completed within 2 hours from time of notification to the Contractor that the media is needed at the SSA data center; and 4) delivery of magnetic tape media from the contractor's facility to the SSA disaster recover facility in New Jersey for both planned and unplanned operations and return of the media to the SSA NCC. Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo complete background investigations.  SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract with a base year and four (4) 1-year options, if exercised. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541519.  The small business size standard for the NAICS code is $21 million. This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 regarding the acquisition of commercial items and FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

<DESC>In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 631 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Stidd Systems of Greenport, NY, as a certified HUBZone contractor for the USSOCOM MK V advanced shock mitigation seats and a full logistics support package.  The appropriation language restricts USSOCOM to procure only the advanced version of the current shock-mitigating MK V SOC seats.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is twofold.  First, 15 U.S.C. 631 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) specifically permit a Government agency, such as the USSOCOM, to enter into a contract with a certified HUBZone contractor as long as the conditions in FAR 19.1306(a) are met.  The USSOCOM has determined that all the conditions set forth in FAR 19.1306(a) exist.  Second, since Stidd manufactured the current shock mitigating MK V SOC seats, they are the only company with an advanced version of the current shock mitigating MK V SOC seats.  The USSOCOM is unaware of any other advanced version of the current shock mitigating MK V SOC seats.  USSOCOM anticipates either a base plus four option year period or a five year ordering period indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a contract maximum of $3 million.  For clarification of the five year ordering period, for the advanced shock mitigating seats and other necessary equipment, the ordering period is three months after award of the contract.  For the logistic support, the ordering period is the entire five year period. It is planned that this contract shall contain the advanced version of the current shock mitigating seats for the USSOCOM MK V SOC; support brackets; all other necessary equipment; and logistics support to include installation; integration; sustaining engineering, a warranty, preventive and corrective maintenance, refurbishment capability, spares, over and above repair support as defined in DFARS 217.77, and all other necessary services.  Note 22 applies.  In addition, any challenging HUBZone company must comply with FAR 19.1303(d), which states in part that "any HUBZone small business concern (nonmanufacturer) proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a HUBZone small business concern manufacturer to receive a benefit under this subpart."  All questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. John Hayes, hayesd@socom.mil, fax (813)828-7504

<DESC>Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith.  Potential technology development and licensing opportunity with BBWI, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  BBWI is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners interested in entering into a license agreement for the purpose of developing and commercializing an Integral High Frequency Ultrasonic Pulser/Receiver technology.  License terms will include an up-front licensing fee and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BBWI or the DOE.  This solicitation will close to response 30 days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their plans to commercialize this technology to the following address: Gary W. Smith,   Sr. Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BBWI, P. O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805.  E-mail is smitgw@inel.gov.  A description of the technology follows. 

BBWI is pursuing patent protection on an Integral High Frequency Ultrasonic Pulser/Receiver technology.  This device is an ultrasonic high-frequency pulser/receiver used when inspection of materials require a depth of field and very near surface resolution. Examples are clad measurements, and flaw inspection. Because of its fast rise and fall time with gain it can provide near surface resolution and depth of field.  It’s physically small in size and contains a lightweight search head.  When coupled to a high frequency ultrasonic transducer it has near surface resolution of less than 40 Nano seconds (0.005 inches) in aluminum. The transducer has a depth of field of 4 Microseconds (0.120 inches of water path or 0.5 inches of Aluminum 6061) with a very clean inspection zone.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to replace existing roofs on 5 structures on the Helena National Forest; the administrative site building and the barn on the Helena Ranger District, two Government-owned houses on the Lincoln Ranger District, and a guard station on the Townsend Ranger District. Work consists of installing new siding, soffits, fascia, roofing, downspouts, gutters and removal of existing roofing, downspouts and gutters and related work. It is possible that work may include sheathing as there is the potential for more extensive repairs than what is known to be needed. Such additional work will be negotiated as necessary. Estimated cost range of this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. Project is located in Lewis & Clark and Meagher Counties, Montana. The NAICS Code for this project is 235610. Offer of award will be made to the Quoter whose quote, as determined by the Contracting Officer, is most advantageous to the Government, considering, but not limited to, factors such as price, contractor capacity to do the work, experience with this type of work, and past performance. Award will be made to one contractor. Completion date is June 2, 2003. Call Scott Craigle at 406-449-5201, ext. 264, for technical details.

Please be advised that the closing date for receipt of proposals is extended until 4pm, Eastern Standard Time on August 4, 2003.  Offerors who have already submitted proposals in response to the Solicitation may either submit revised proposals, or notify DOL's Office of Procurement Services in writing that they wish to be evaluated based on their current proposals.

Please fax your REQUESTS FOR A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION to the Office of Procurement Services BY JULY 1, 2003.  DOL is taking this action because it has come to our attention that some potential offerors may have missed the January 29th FedBizOpps notice because they were relying on DOL issuing individual written notices to them concerning this procurement.

Potential offerors are advised that, henceforth, DOL will publicize procurements only through FedBizOpps, the Government-wide point of entry, which may be accessed on the Internet at http://www2.eps.gov  Individual notices will no longer be sent to potential offerors.  Should offerors receive any information or notice concerning a future solicitation, it is not official and should not be relied upon. Instead, offerors should consult FedBizOpps for official notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 513390   The following is a correction to Modification 1 to RFQ-DC-03-00237, NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED, the due date for quotes remains unchanged, noon, June 19, 2003. CORRECTION TO MODIFICATION 1, QUESTION 2, THE ANSWER: See Modification 01, Answer to Question 2:  The  sites do not need downlink and will most likely not be able to view the program as it is in process from their remote site.  There will be no internet connections at most of the remote sites (simply because they are remote).  WAS INCORRECT AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY THE FOLLOWING: Remote sites will  need to downlink the program. Each remote site should be able to downlink the master feed (from Beaufort) and use the third audio channel for IFB type communication.  This will allow the remote sites to see what's coming up before them and the third audio channel will be configured to use as an IFB  (so we can actually talk to the camera operator live while the show is going on).  This is only possible if all feeds are on the same satellite.   The following are additional answers to questions submitted to RFQ-DC-03-00237, NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED, the due date for quotes remains  unchanged. Question #1)  On integration on 7 sites does this mean simultaneous feeds coming in or does in mean alternating feeds on uplinking? Or is it 3 feeds at any given time?  Answer #1) On page 3 of the original SOW, the following paragraph responds to the above question: "The contractor will  provide 35 hours of KU satellite transponder time on the same KU Satellite or satellites as required to accomplish back-to-back sites transmission over the two day event.  This will include a host site segment cutting directly to a remote site or sites.  Remote sites may or may not directly  introduce the next site.  Contractor should specify transponder time by the hour in the event that more or less time may be required.  In the event that one or more sites may be combined contractor should spec satellite trucks and crew by the site so contract may be reduced as required.  Production  plans will be finalized well before this contract is let."  The maximum number of sites that will be live on the satellite at any one time is 3.  The draft schedule for the EstuaryLive 2003 program has been posted on www.estuarylive.org and indicates the anticipated timeslots for each remote  location.  NOTE-each remote site should be able to downlink the master feed (from Beaufort) and use the third audio channel for IFB type communication Question #2)  On communications with remote sites?does this mean 7 land lines into production plus 7 lines for sat communications. Answer #2)  Per  the response to the previous question, the 7 remote sites will not be operating simultaneously.  Therefore the host site will not need 7 land lines plus 7 lines for satellite communications. NOTE-each remote site should be able to downlink the master feed (from Beaufort) and use the third audio  channel for IFB type communication. Question #3)  Concerning production?.where is the Director, Asst. Director , and video engineer (for Ikky cams)?why not 3 camera shoot at Beaufort? Answer #3)  The Director and video-engineer (etc.) are in Beaufort.  A third mobile, fourth and fifth fixed  cameras using microwave transmission for an island site will be provided using existing equipment so only two "additional" production cameras will be required in Beaufort along with Beta SP playback in the truck.  Remember camera operators (as specified) are needed including for the remote  microwave camera?these cameras are non-genlocked and require a framesync to bring them into the truck. Question #4)At remote sites do you require IFB or full program audio.  Discreet IFB or common IFB?  Answer #4)  Remote sites need a common IFB. Question #5)  Do remote sites need to see program  feed?  Answer #5)  REMOTE SITES will need to downlink the program. Each remote site should be able to downlink the master feed (from Beaufort) and use the third audio channel for IFB type communication.  This will allow the remote sites to see what's coming up before them and the third audio  channel will be configured to use as an IFB (so we can actually talk to the camera operator live while the show is going on).  This is only possible if all feeds are on the same satellite. Question #6)  Are 7 IFBs generating from the main truck in NC.  Answer #6) YES Question #7)  Define fly pack  requirements.  Answer #7)  It is conceivable that one site may require a unit that could be transported to the site over lite-load bridge in something as small as a Toyota type pickup.  This is TBD at this time and it is likely that a standard sized truck would be just fine at this site.  ONE OTHER  SITE might require a liteweight truck (Econoline Van size).  This is a site that is at the end of a long pier with an 8-10 thousand pound limit.  It is also conceivable that this site could use a standard large truck with a long triax or fiber to get the camera to the shoot location down the pier.   Also TBD at this time. Question #8)  What are the requirements for the main program feed (that I assume originates out of the North Carolina site?)  KU band analog or KU band digital?  Answer #8) KU Band analog Question #9) Are there any other input sources (not including the remote site  satellite feeds) required from the location field production site at the North Carolina location other than the two camera? Is there a microwave feed of any sort as a source at that location?  Answer #9)  In Beaufort there will be 4 live cameras, 2 microwave feeds, 1 Beta SP Playback and 2  satellite downlinks for a total of 9 input sources. Question # 10) Can the feed from the remote sites be a digital transmission, also what format will the main show be in (analog or digital)?  Answer #10)  The feed from the remote sites CANNOT be a digital transmission.  The format of the main  show will be in analog.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO EXTEND DEADLINE TO JULY 9, 2003

Multicenter randomized clinical trials studying the impact of combined angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy on kidney disease progression in hypertensive patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services seeks collaborations with Industry to provide blinded (ACE inhibitor, ARB, and long-acting metoprololol) and unblinded (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, clonidine, and a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) anti-hypertensive medications to study their impact on kidney disease progression in the setting of PKD.  The study group will perform two prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials of combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.  In one trial, 560 hypertensive patients at an early stage of PKD will be recruited and the trial will compare combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy to beta-blocker, as the primary blinded intervention.  Two different levels of blood pressure control will be studied.  In the second trial, 700 patients with more advanced PKD will be recruited and the trial will compare combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy to ACE inhibitor, as the primary blinded intervention.  Enrollment for both trials will occur at four participating clinical centers.  The trials will have a two-year recruitment phase, and patients will have an average follow-up of four years.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK-funded Data Coordinating Center at Washington University, St. Louis, MO.  

Although substantial experimental and clinical data implicate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathogenesis of hypertension in PKD, in the progression of structural changes such as renal cyst growth and renal interstitial fibrosis, and in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, clinical studies to date have not addressed whether complete blockade of the RAAS alters the clinical course of PKD.  This effort therefore represents the first large NIH-sponsored interventional trials of PKD, which will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large cohort of PKD patients, and will determine the impact of intensive blockade of the RAAS and level of blood pressure control in patients with early and more advanced PKD.    

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in the selections.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: (1)  willingness and ability to provide blinded and unblinded anti-hypertension medications; (2)  willingness and ability to provide repackaging and distribution of blinded medications;  (3)  timeline for providing medications.

SUBMISSION DATE:  A Collaborator Capability Statement must be submitted by  July 9, 2003.  

CONTACT INFORMATION:  Collaborator Capability Statements should be sent by e-mail, fax or mail delivered by July 9, 2003 to:  Rochelle S.

<DESC>1.1.	Introduction
The United States Postal Service (USPS) seeks to implement a comprehensive outsourced copying and finishing shop solution that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves customer service.  Current work processes within USPS headquarters dictate that hard copy business documents be hand delivered to our in-house print shop.  These documents are then duplicated using four fully depreciated printers: two analog copiers, one non-networked copier, and one non-networked color copier.  In the past several years, print shop copy volumes and usage has decreased primarily due to the proliferation of floor copiers as well as the large number of color and black and white desktop printers used throughout headquarters building.  
1.2.	Purpose and Strategy
The USPS seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who can propose and execute a virtual and/or near-site/on-site copying and finishing shop solution that leverages the supplier’s ample capacity, state of the art equipment and appropriate operations coverage.  USPS headquarters users should ultimately receive service that exceeds the current levels provided on-site.  This solution should also alleviate the USPS burden of extraneous production equipment to maintain or replace as it becomes obsolete.  It should provide business process improvements such just-in-time document production; enhanced service offerings, digital technology, internet linkage, and elimination of maverick reprographic spend.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking vendors who can provide a real-time mainframe based IP monitor.  TCP/IP on the mainframe has paved the way for the development and installation of mission-critical applications and software products using the TCP/IP protocol.  In order to effectively monitor and manage the TCP/IP stacks and application environments, state-of-the-art tools are a necessity.  It is vital that these strategic TCP/IP entities are efficiently monitored in “real-time” and with as little system and network overhead as possible.  SSA wants to procure an enterprise-wide license with no restrictions on the number of physical/logical CPUs.

The specific requirements include:

• Employs an event-driven method of data collection by 
  scrutinizing data as it passes through the TCP/IP stack instead 
  of polling via SNMP or using NetStat commands for its essential 
  services.  

• Does NOT REQUIRE the cutting/recording of SMF records to record 
  activity.  SMF recording must be an available option should 
  occasional SMF recording need to take place.

• Detects fragmentation and retransmissions as they occur and 
  generates alerts to identify the actual connection involved 
  instantaneously.

• Detects Connections Rejects in real time.  

• Reports on Idle Resources in real time.      

• Requires a well-developed NetView interface with the capability 
  to forward alerts to NetView’s hardware monitor, and enable 
  network automation routines to perform additional IP monitoring 
  functions to automate error detection and recovery routines.  

• Requires a NetView 3270 interface for entering commands and 
  receiving responses to commands.  

• Ability to report on ICMP counts and also scrutinizes ICMP 
  packets and detects indications of performance and/or 
  availability problems in real time.  

• Reports on response time for TN3270 sessions.  Application as 
  well as network response time must be reported.


Vendors are hereby requested to submit capability statements that address their ability to perform the services describe above. Responses may also include comments, recommendations as well as suggestions for additional information. All responses should be sent via email to: Lisa.Barrett@ssa.gov, or by mail to the above address attn: Lisa Barrett. PLEASE, NO PHONE CALLS. This announcement is a request for information and market research only and does not obligate the Government in any way. This is not a formal request for proposal. Responses to this request are on a voluntary basis and failure to respond will not impact any future acquisitions.

<SUBJECT>A -- FALCON - Force Application and Launch from CONUS
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force are jointly sponsoring the FALCON program to develop technologies and demonstrate capabilities that will enable transformational changes in global, time critical strike missions.  This announcement provides a high-level overview of the program, provides information on release of a draft solicitation to be followed by a final solicitation within the next sixty (60) days, and provides notification of an Industry Day related to the program.  The Government?s vision of an ultimate prompt global reach capability (circa 2025 and beyond) is engendered in a reusable Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV).  This autonomous aircraft would be capable of taking off from a conventional military runway and striking targets 9,000 nautical miles distant in less than two hours.  It could carry a 12,000-pound payload consisting of Common Aero Vehicles (CAVs), cruise missiles, small diameter bombs or other munitions.  The Government is interested in innovative HCV concepts that utilize novel technologies that mitigate heat load and extend range.  Such innovative concepts could enable effective global reach missions and potentially provide the first stage of a two-stage access to space vehicle. A much nearer term prompt, global strike capability is needed however.  This near-term operational capability is embodied in the CAV munitions delivery system integrated with a low-cost, operationally responsive, Small Launch Vehicle (SLV).  CAV is an unpowered, maneuverable, hypersonic glide vehicle capable of carrying approximately 1,000 pounds in munitions or other payload.  SLV, a low-cost, responsive launch system is capable of boosting a CAV to its requisite insertion conditions (e.g. geo-location, altitude, velocity, and attitude).  Taken together, the CAV/SLV system will enable this nearer-term global reach capability.  The SLV will serve a two-fold function in that it will also provide a low-cost, responsive launch capability for placing small satellites into Sun Synchronous Orbit. The goal of the joint DARPA/Air Force FALCON program is to develop and validate, in-flight, technologies that will enable both near-term and far-term capability to execute time-critical, prompt global strike missions.  The fundamental underpinnings of the technical approach to be taken in the FALCON program is the recognition that a common set of technologies can be matured in an evolutionary manner that will provide a near-term (approximately 2010) operational capability for prompt global strike from CONUS while also enabling future development of a reusable HCV for the far-term (approximately 2025).   This common set of key technologies includes: efficient aerodynamic shaping for high lift to drag, lightweight and durable high temperature materials, thermal management techniques including active cooling and trajectory shaping (such as periodic flight), target update and weapons separation.  These technologies will be matured to flight readiness, integrated into a system design and demonstrated in a series of flight-tests.  Flight tests will be conducted in a progressive manner and will provide an evolutionary forum for developing responsive concepts of operation and a low-cost launch infrastructure.  DARPA plans to release a draft Solicitation for Phase I of the FALCON Technology Demonstration program on or about June 20, 2003.  The draft will describe the goals and objectives of this three (3) Phase effort.  The planned three phases are generally described as follows: Phase I ? System Definition, approximately 6 months, multiple sources; Phase II ? Design and Development, approximately 36 months, downselect ? up to two sources; Phase III ? Weapon System Demonstrations, approximately 30 months, single source. Questions and comments are invited from potential offerors on all aspects of the draft solicitation, including the program plan, objectives, proposal instructions, and acquisition approach.  The Government is not requesting proposals in response to this draft solicitation, does not intend to award a contract or agreement on the basis of this draft solicitation and does not intend to pay for any information received regarding this solicitation.  The DARPA web page (WWW.DARPA.MIL) will host the draft solicitation and all information pertaining to it.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit questions/comments through the email link provided at this web page. An Industry Day is anticipated to be held on or about July 8, 2003 from 8:30 to 12:30 at Mary Mount University in Arlington, VA.  This meeting is intended to convey an overview of the program and solicitation to Industry.  Attendance at the event will be limited to five (5) representatives per company.  The meeting will be unclassified.  Access to the meeting is limited to U.S. citizens, individuals with a green card or resident aliens.  Prior registration for Industry Day is required for all attendees.  Further details for Industry Day including directions, procedures for registration, and scheduling one-on-one meetings following Industry Day will be posted on the DARPA web page on or about June 20, 2003. No other announcements will be issued prior to release of the final program solicitation.  Points of Contact:  Dr. Steven H.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Regions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8(Wyoming) and those 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in these SBA districts (See http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ to view Region Map).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to be selected from 8(a) firms, within specified SBA districts, that meet the qualification requirements as set forth in this announcement.  Those firms that can demonstrate that they meet the qualification requirements will be awarded a BOA.  The estimated period of performance for the BOAs will be one year (1) with the Navy reserving the right to exercise options for up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the specified SBA District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The Navy will compete task orders issued under the BOAs among the BOA holders.  Each task order that is issued shall constitute a separate contract. Each task order may contain pre-priced options for the continued performance of environmental work under the task order.  The BOA firm will be required to furnish all labor, materials, tools, management, supervision, laboratory testing, engineering and equipment required of the task order.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained from the BOA firms within the designated SBA District, the Navy reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent Districts.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 for each task order that can be awarded to an 8(a) firm. There is no assurance of a steady stream of work under this program.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future orders with the Contractor or to require the Navy to solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. See also the Supplemental Information Sheet uploaded separately to the FedBizOpps and titled “Frequently Asked Questions” to help answer previous questions and concerns.

Education of the personnel is also a consideration for this factor. The offeror shall present the resumes of the personnel they are proposing for this work.  An Acceptable rating will result from the preponderance of personnel resumes disclosing that education, work background, experience demonstrate relevant, comprehensive and cogent experience with environmental RAO/LTM type work as set forth in the Scope of Work. An offeror that provides little or no information or provides resumes of proposed personnel that have little or no qualifying education or experience will receive an Unacceptable rating.
Team Disclosure
		a.  Please disclose in your proposal any subcontractor teaming arrangements.  The name of the company, point of contact, address and telephone number should be included.
		b.  In order to establish your bona fide place of business, only the information concerning the Prime 8(a) firm will be taken into account.  Although the non-8(a) firm teaming party may have many offices in multiple states, it is the Prime 8(a) firm who is responsible for establishing the bona fide place of business with the SBA for purposes of this solicitation.  The Prime 8(a) firm should provide its bona fide office information (address, point of contact, telephone/fax, email address) for each office location.
BOA Task Order Competition- Orders issued under the BOAs will be competed among BOA holders. Each solicitation for an order will indicate the degree of detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. The contractor will be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors as well as a price proposal.   LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $5,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.   However, the Navy has no obligation to issue any orders under any BOA.
Competing for BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to those BOA holders in a given SBA District where the work will be performed. If sufficient competition or interest is not found in the given SBA District, the Navy will seek competition from adjacent districts by allowing those BOA holders to participate in the Task Order competition.
The proposals will be reviewed using either Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable criteria. The best value process may consider such factors as Key Personnel, Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.   Best Value is a method of evaluation, which allows the combination of technical considerations in combination with price to provide the greatest overall value to the Navy.  The RFP will inform the BOA holders the method of evaluation, either Best Value or Low Price Technically Acceptable.

<DESC>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  

Q1.	Will firms be able to enter the BOA Program after the initial submittal?
A1.	Yes, we plan to open the BOA pool semi-annually for new qualifying firms.

Q2.	What is the difference between low price vs. low price - technically acceptable vs. best value proposals?
A2.	Low price technically acceptable implies technical qualifications that low price does not.  See FAR Subpart 15.3 for best value. We anticipate using only low-price technically acceptable or best value criteria.

Q3.	Please explain, “BOAs up to $3M is not competitive”?
A3.	In the 8(a) program, projects under the $3M threshold are not competitive; but must be sole sourced.  SouthDiv received a waiver from SBA to compete projects under the $3M threshold.

Q4.	Please identify the SBA Districts applicable to the program?
A4.	http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ SBA region map shows the Regions in SouthDiv's AOR. There are approx. 30 SBA Districts within our AOR.

Q5.	If you have, say 10 BOA firms for a given SBA District, are you accepting 10 proposals from them or will you request proposals from only a selected number of firms?
A5.	We would be soliciting those firms holding BOAs within the SBA district where the work is to be accomplished.

Q6.	Once you have a BOA are you required to compete or are some task orders sole source?
A6.	The Navy plans to compete each requirement.

Q7.	In landfill remediations where there are lots of unknown contaminants, will tasks be based on fixed price and what will be the procedure for non-scope work encountered?
A7.	The Task Orders will be fixed priced and contain the "changes" clause.

Q8.	Do you see the BOAs being used earlier in the CERILA/RCRA process than O&M or LTM (example, asbestos abatement)?
A8.	No, strictly RAO/LTM work, not R/A type work.

Q9.	Do you expect any Conflict of Interest between RAO and LTM?
A9.	No.

Q10.	Can 2 or more 8A firms join to go after a BOA, if so how will they be credited?
A10.	Yes, however they must still meet the size standard for the NAICS Code applicable. They will be evaluated under a “teaming arrangement” and only one BOA will be issued to the 8(a) firm identified as the Prime. 

Q11.	Service contracts (Remedial Actions) do not require (by 13CFR or FAR) offices to be located in the SBA District or geographic area of the work.
a.	Therefore, is it simply a condition of the contract that an office be in each respective district and or has there been a change to 13CFR or the FAR for this requirement?
b.	In a Joint Venture, teaming, or mentor protégé arrangement do the offices of the JV, MP, or team member counts toward this requirement? How about a subcontractor address?

A11a.	 There has been no change to the regulations. Although SBA can only impose geographical restrictions in construction, SBA and the Navy agreed to this requirement for the BOAs.
A11b.  No, the Prime 8(a) firm’s location will always be the indicator.	

Q12.	If an 8(a) small business graduates from the 8(a) program during the BOA performance period, how would NAVFAC SOUTHDIV respond?
A12.	Once an 8(a) firm graduates from the program, they can no longer participate in future solicitations under the BOA.  They must still complete any existing contract task orders that were awarded to them prior to their graduation.   

Q13.	We would like to propose but not for all SOUTHDIV SBA regions.  In our proposal, how should we identify which SOUTHDIV SBA regions we are including in our proposal?
A13.	Once you are issued a BOA, you will only be able to participate in projects that are located in the areas you have a bona-fide place of business.

Q14.	On submitting a proposal for multiple SOUTHDIV SBA regions, do we need to submit a separate proposal for each region or will one proposal satisfy the multiple region requirement?
A14.	You do not need to submit separate proposals; however, you must provide all of the information required under each factor for the various laboratories, key personnel, safety requirements, etc. if you will be using different participants in each of the regions where you have a bona-fide place of business.  
Q15.	 In regards to Technical Factor 3, can you elaborate on what you are looking for in terms of internal communication?
A15.	 For this factor - we are evaluating how the firm communicates internally.  How does information flow between the head of the organization, down through to the project manager or whomever the firms designates to oversee or run this task order on the contract.  How are subcontractors, laboratories, materials, etc. notified and coordinated?  How are the safety of employees and the safety plan integrated into the communications?  How is progress on a given task orders monitored?  Overall, once the task order is placed with the firm, how is it assigned, resourced, monitored, and tracked from home office to the individuals in the field accomplishing the work.  If problems occur in executing the work, how are these communicated and the Contracting Officer notified?  We are not trying to dictate a process; however, we need to evaluate how the firm's internal staff, suppliers, subcontractors, other firms and teaming arrangements are coordinated in receiving, processing, and executing the task order.

Q16.	Should the resumes of laboratory personnel be provided as proof to the "credentials of the laboratory personnel" in Technical Factor #4?  It was unclear as to how much information is needed for their credentials. 
A16.	An indication of the credentials of the laboratory personnel with resumes is one method to provide this information.  It certainly would be a good indicator of the type of individuals, their qualifications, and experience levels.  We wouldn't expect all of the laboratory personnel resumes to be included. Firms in the past have included some or all resumes.  Others have included education and experience of key laboratory or department level individuals.  

Q17.	Can you explain what the solicitation means when it states the business size standard for this contract is 500 employees?
A17.	This is the size standard in the NAICS Code 562910.  The 8(a) firm shall not employ over 500 employees, and this figure includes the employees of any teaming firm.

Q18.	In regards to Technical Factor 1, should we submit 3 projects from the 8a Firm and 3 projects from the teaming firm? Or should we submit 3 projects ONLY?
A18.	This factor requests a total of at least 3 projects within the last three years.  You may submit more than three, if you desire.  As stated, this factor considers past performance from the offeror and its proposed subcontractors/teaming firms.
