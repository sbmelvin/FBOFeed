<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXPRESSION OF INTEREST</span></strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, AND POTENTIAL OPERATION OF A SUPPLEMENTAL SALT WASTE TREATMENT CAPABILITY<br /><br /></strong>Savannah River Remediation LLC (SRR) is currently contracted to operate the liquid waste (LW) system at the Savannah River Site (SRS) under prime contract DE-AC09-09SR22505. The LW system consists of several facilities to safely receive, store, treat, and permanently dispose radioactive waste. The waste in the storage tanks may be classified into two broad general radioactive waste categories, high level waste (HLW) and low level waste (LLW), present in three forms: supernatant, sludge, and salt. Salt contains salt crystals (which form after the evaporated supernatant is cooled), and entrapped interstitial supernatant liquid. The sludge, primarily insoluble oxides, is dispositioned directly through vitrification in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The salt is treated to remove strontium, actinides, and cesium resulting in decontaminated salt solution (DSS) or LLW fraction disposed through the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF), and a HLW fraction disposed through vitrification in DWPF. Salt waste is currently being treated by SRR in the SRS Actinide Removal Process/Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit, and this waste material will also be treated in the Salt Waste Processing Facility. In accordance with the SRS Liquid Waste System Plans Revisions 16 and 17, a supplemental salt waste treatment capability is desired to shorten the Liquid Waste lifecycle.
<p>The purpose of this inquiry is to determine market place interest and qualifications for development, deployment, and potential operation of a supplemental salt waste treatment capability. SRR will use the information obtained in your response to this Expression of Interest (EOI) to determine your firm's ability and interest in performing this service. This EOI is for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>SRR is seeking innovative solutions for treatment of salt waste in the areas of technical, operational, business, and financial alternatives. This EOI identifies standard parameters such as payment for per gallon of waste treated, identification of existing and legacy treatment technologies, and commercial terms and conditions. Potential offerors are encouraged to respond with innovations in all aspects of salt waste treatment that will support a cost effective, financially viable, and aggressive schedule potential subcontract.</p>
<p>This EOI does not commit SRR to issue a future solicitation for these services, to award a subcontract, or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any response. Any subsequent procurement actions will be subject to availability of future funding.</p>
<p>EOI responses (2 hard copies, 1 electronic copy) are requested and will be received by SRR through 5:00 P.M. EDT on Monday, July 16, 2012. Please direct all responses to:</p>
<p>Savannah River Remediation LLC<br />Savannah River Site<br />Attention: Mayes White<br />Building 707-9B, Room 8<br />Aiken, SC 29808</p>
<p>If you do not plan to submit a response, a brief letter indicating your lack of interest and reasons would be appreciated. Documents provided to potential offerors should be protected and used solely for the purpose of this EOI. Information should not be shared unless a party has a need to know to support your response. Potential offerors are asked to return all documents to the Procurement Specialist for disposition.</p>
<p>Please acknowledge receipt and your intent to respond. If no response is received by the submission date, SRR will assume that you have no interest in participating in this procurement.</p>

<p>Sources Sought notice published under Solicitation #FA8601-12-R-0036 on 11 April 2012.</p>
<p>This notice is posted in accordance with FAR 5.2 and 36.213-2.</p>
<p>This acquisition is FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 237110 and the Size Standard is $33.5M.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-7004 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-12-R-0036<br />Project 060034, Replace Gravity Main, Springfield Street from Gate 1B to Smithville Rd. This project replaces approximately 10,000 linear feet of 21 to 27 inch gravity sanitary sewer from west of Gate 1B along Springfield Street to a manhole in the center of Smithville Road. The pipeline crosses under the Harshman Road overpass, runs through Yorktown Colony Apartments, and follows an abandoned railroad line through the East Gardendale Plat in the City of Riverside. Work includes installing sanitary sewer main using open cut, jack and boring, and pipe bursting methods; by-passing sanitary flows equal to or greater than 2.0 million gallons per day in an active sanitary main with no disruption to sanitary service; replacing sanitary pipe through an active roadway with no road closures to include off-ramps, main intersections and general vehicle traffic; coordinating with multiple government agencies; and constructing sewer pipe through the following types of property: residential, multi-residential complexes, and commercial.</p>
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: Restrictive easement boundaries through private properties outside base boundaries. Line traverses through an apartment complex creating restrictive safety considerations. Line is under Springfield Street at the Harshman Road by-pass. This will require micro tunneling and bore and jack procedures to avert surface disruptions. In addition, there are line traverses near many private company utility lines that will have to be accounted for and avoided. This will require an experienced contractor to keep sewage flow operational for over half of WPAFB's Area B and all of Area A (Patterson Field). Failure in this project could result in a shutdown of WPAFB operations, environmental contamination and resultant fines and penalties, and a widespread power/water/sewer outages off base.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 300-day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00</p>
<p>NOTES: <br />1. The solicitation with the official specifications and drawings will be available on the World Wide Web on or about 26 June 2012, at http://www.fbo.gov. The tentative date for receipt of proposals is 26 July 2012. The period of performance is 300 days.</p>
<p>2. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. You may, however, download and print the file from the web site www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>3. There is no fee for this solicitation.</p>
<p>4. A registration page will be attached to the web site. You are not required to register. However, when you register, you will receive notice of any amendments and/or addenda that may be issued to the solicitation. If you have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the web site for any changes to the solicitation.</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

<DESC>Dear Colleagues:
<p>Over the past decade, the NSF has participated in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, designed to address a wide variety of important scientific objectives as described in the Program's Initial Science Plan (http://www.iodp.org/isp). The primary US contribution to this international program has been the operation of a leased drilling vessel (D/V JOIDES Resolution).</p>
<p>To ensure the nation is receiving the greatest value for its substantial investment, it is the intent of NSF to competitively solicit proposals for the operation and management of the JOIDES Resolution drill ship to support the future International Ocean Discovery Program. Re-competed tasks will include onboard science operations, down-hole measurements, core and data repository management, management of the ship leasing subcontract with Overseas Drilling, Limited (ODL), and integrative logistical, planning and management support. NSF expects a solicitation to be issued before the end of August 2012, with at least a 120 day window for proposal submission.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to manufacture twenty (20) shim safety rods for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 20MW Nuclear Reactor in accordance with the Specifications, Drawings, and Work Instructions that will be provided by the Government.
<p>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) owns and operates a 20 MW Test Reactor. This reactor is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the name NBSR (National Bureau of Standards) Reactor. The purpose of the NBSR is to be a steady state source of neutron radiation that is being used to perform a variety of radiation experiments under the research programs of the NCNR.</p>
<p>Among the main safety related components of the NBSR are the Shim Safety Rods (SSR's). The function of the SSR's is to regulate and control the nuclear reaction that is taking place in the core of the reactor. The operation part of an SSR is a sheet of the metal cadmium (Cd: a strong neutron absorber) that is captured between two concentric aluminum cylinders, such that no cadmium is in contact with the outside world. These cylinders do not have a circular cross-section. Their cross-section is better described as "oval" or, better yet, as "race track" . The NBSR employs four (4) SSR's simultaneously.</p>
<p>Just like reactor fuel, SSR's are consumables. As they perform their function as control rods, the cadmium in them slowly "burns up" (which means that, during use, the cadmium isotope that performs the control function is slowly replaced by another cadmium isotope that cannot be used to control the reactor). In practice, this means that the SSR's need to be replaced approximately, every four (4) years. The SSR's are replaced in sets of four (4).</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 18 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>A fixed-price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-12-RP-0032.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement Contract N00019-12-G-0006 with the Bell Boeing Joint Project Office on an &lsquo;other than full and open' competitive basis to address obsolescence driven issues. This effort includes the incorporation of multiple requirements listed as follows: (1) Address the Non-Recurring Engineering of the replacement Slim Multi-Function Display (SMFD) Glass and Firmware change in the video card and 2) Address the Non-Recurring Engineering of the replacement Quad-in-line Digital Microcircuit within the Cockpit Interface Unit (CIU) 1553B Remote Terminal (RT) Circuit Card Assembly (CCA). Both of these issues require mitigation due to obsolescence issues and diminishing manufacturing sources for parts. The glass is a Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU) within the existing SMFD and has 100 percent commonality with FA-18. Qualification testing (95 percent) has been completed based on commonality between both NAVAIR program offices and simultaneous qualification testing by Boeing. This effort entails Delta qualification of replacement glass in order to complete V-22 unique vibration and environmental testing requirements stipulated in accordance with the V-22 Aircraft System Design Specifications. Additionally, the implementation of the "Black Screen" corrective action, as a no-cost effort, will be jointly performed with the SMFD Glass Replacement effort. In regards to the CIU obsolescence NRE effort, the vendor for the CIU and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the microcircuit have identified available Wafer material for a replacement part. This effort entails the assurance testing and characterization of the replacement Quad-in-line Digital Microcircuit and verify that the replacement microcircuit meets the existing baseline of the obsolete component stipulated in accordance with V-22 Aircraft System Design Specifications in order to meet MV/CV-22 Osprey production line requirements.
<p>Bell-Boeing is the only known source that possesses the requisite knowledge and expertise required to perform this effort. For subcontracting opportunities please contact Ralph D'iorio at 610-591-9157 or Ralph.b.d'iorio@boeing.com and Matthew Sticksel at 817-280-3103 or msticksel@bellhelicopter.textron.com.</p>

<DESC>
The Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 1 has a requirement for VISN wide requirement for an Anesthesia Record Keeper (ARK) Clinical Information Systems (CIS). 

In this Request For Proposals, the VA has outlined the present and future hospitals' processes not only for managing the surgical patient, but also for how VISN 1 requires the CIS to be part of those processes.  Upon completion of the installation, the VISN will have a state of the art and fully integrated system which will meet or exceed the needs of the VISN sites. The system shall employ advanced technological methods in the integration of healthcare data to improve patient quality of care, reduction of medical errors, and increase in cost savings.  This is a critical component of this project.  Offerors must also be able to provide the required interfaces as specified in their submitted timelines and as further defined herein for a complete turnkey project. 

An essential requirement is the establishment, implementation and continuity of a unified data solution throughout the VISN.  In these terms, data definitions, data comparisons, clinical usage is expected to be seamlessly consistent across all VISN sites.  The solution must first encompass individual identical hospital databases, with concurrent compilation and replication at a central data repository.  Hence, changes in the CIS database at one hospital must automatically upload to the central repository as well as at all other facilities in the VISN. The database must be identical within all hospitals in the VISN.  All database and template modifications must be entered only once and immediately propagated to all VISN hospitals.  Individual hospital databases and templates must be locked to prevent local modifications.  The ability to create new database elements, controlled at the VISN level for VISN-wide collection, must be maintained.  Note:  this must not prevent the ability to assign informational lines (e.g., specific templates or assessments), unique for the management of a specific patient, for use at the individual facility level and to be included in the patient's permanent medical record.  The Offeror acknowledges these requirements and confirms their capabilities of providing an all inclusive CIS that will meet the current and future needs of the VISN.  

The CIS must be capable of importing physiologic data as a continuous stream from most standard patient monitoring devices.  This data must include, but will not be limited to, invasive and non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, fraction of inspired oxygen, respiratory rate, and temperature.  When available, inspired nitrous oxide concentration, fraction of inspired air, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, central venous pressure, and ST segment analysis must be included.  The new system will assist nursing staff in tracking one-time, as-needed, and periodic patient care tasks.  Physicians will be able to use the new CIS to assess the patient, much as they use the anesthesia paper flowsheet now.  Once properly accessed, CIS workstations must have the capability to toggle (foreground/background continuous functionality) between the CIS applications and the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

The new CIS shall allow for future expansion due to the anticipated and changing needs in VISN 1.  The system shall allow for the addition of future CISs such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) CIS, enabling them to seamlessly pass data to one another to create contiguous electronic perioperative-critical care information system. 


Contractor shall provide all project management, supervision, training, travel and expenses, software and software licenses necessary to furnish and install an electronic Anesthesia Record Keeper (ARK)  - Clinical Information Systems (CIS) (hereinafter CIS or system).  Initial locations where the CIS will be installed are listed on Attachment A and shall include the VA Medical Centers (VAMC) located in Jamaica Plain, MA; West Roxbury, MA; West Haven, CT; Augusta, ME; Manchester, NH; Providence, RI; and Whiter River Junction, VT..  This VISN reserves the right to add any additional facilities that are within the VISN as of the date of award of the contract without any additional cost to the government. Although none are anticipated at this time, the successful bidder will be notified at least two (2) weeks in advance by the VISN Primary COTR through the Contracting Officer of any such change.  

Contractor shall provide all services associated with the furnishing and installation of this system.  Contractor shall provide the most efficient means of optimizing training, system maintenance, and data exchange throughout each facility in the VISN.  All services shall be completed within 180 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed for the initial VISN site and 180 days for all remaining VISN sites.  Thus, ARK CIS implementation for the entire VISN shall be completed within 360 days after award.

Under any resulting contract, the Contractor shall be responsible to upgrade/update the ARK CIS on an on-going basis to remain compatible with all applications used throughout the VISN as they are also upgraded and improved.   This service shall be provided by the Contractor during the warranty period, which shall be for a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the completion of the installation, testing, training and final acceptance of each location by the government.  The cost for the warranty shall be included in the Price for the product, therefore any services provided during the warranty period will be provided at no additional cost to the government as further defined in the Contract Specifications.  Any changes to the above will be communicated by the VISN Primary COTR through the Contracting Officer to the successful Offeror.

In conjunction with this new ARK CIS, this VISN intends on procuring under a separate agreement, an analytic database such as the Solution Analytics / RGI Healthcare Solution.  This Healthcare solution will be capable of using values from clinical data stores (including but not limited to the existing CIS, VistA, the new ARK CIS and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)).  The CIS data captured will span the entire surgical visit and include all data available from the CIS database.  Physiologic data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, shall be captured at least once a minute.  The CIS database shall specifically allow for the storage and analysis of all very granular data captured by the critical care CIS rather than a sample or summary of the data.  A clinician must be available to add new data elements to the systems without loss of performance or functionality. 

The CIS under this Contract shall also enable full integration of all systems including the analytic database and clinical data obtained from the VA's electronic medical record, VistA, and other existing VA systems as further defined herein by extracting its data and placing it in a file folder in accordance with the data extract specifications identified in the Data Extract Tab of Attachment D System Specification.  A response to this RFP will constitute confirmation that it can extract data and place it in a file folder with the structure as in the Data Extraction Tab of the System Specification. 

A.1. 	Contractor shall provide Project Management Services (PMS) and Technical Support services required for the ARK CIS system.  These services shall include all services necessary to ensure that the system operates in an efficient manner as intended as further defined in Attachment D, System Specification.  These services shall only be performed by qualified technicians/personnel.

A.2.	All software furnished under this Contract shall be unlimited, perpetual site licenses and shall include all upgrades, Version changes and/or updates to the software at no additional cost to the government during the warranty period and throughout the duration of this contract, providing that the government has authorized continued services under the Option Renewal periods.  All software shall be installed on equipment at each location as further defined in Paragraph E, VISN Facilities.  
 
The Contractor shall be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) www.pbn.gov/ccr/default.aspx. The NAICS is 562212 with a size standard of $25.5 Million. The solicitation will be available to interested vendors on or about 6/15/2012. Point of Contact is Kristine Clark at Kristine.Clark@va.gov.

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 01 - 650 - Providence, RI is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. technical specifications, etc.) may be requested, pricing shall be entered in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the awardee may be required to complete the solicitation documents at the time of award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation.

Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices.

Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a noncompetitive contract to NatureServe to support USGS implementation of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Standards (FGDC 2008).
NatureServe is an established scientific organization with a long history of developing and maintaining biological information and data systems.  NatureServe is the only organization that currently maintains a vegetation classification database consistent with the U.S. NVC.   The databases maintained by NatureServe are proprietary, including Biotics where the alliance type descriptions are maintained, making them the sole provider of much of the information necessary to complete the National Vegetation Classification System, specifically the attributes required to complete the template for each of the alliance descriptions.  No other organization maintains and has access to the legacy data necessary to complete this task efficiently.
Questions may be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer by email (Lmccarthy@usgs.gov).  Request for Proposal G12PS00452 will be made available to NatureServe on or about June 18, 2012.  The NAICS Code is 541620.  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months from date of contract award with one one-year option.  Numbered note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>Restoration of the decorative finishes and gilded cast plaster ornaments (including conservation of original burnished water gilding) on the walls in the Senate Reception Room (S-213) next to the Senate Chamber in the US Capitol
<SOLNBR>SS120001
<RESPDATE>062012
<CONTACT>Jerrod T Whittington, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Email jwhittin@aoc.gov
<DESC>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is posting this sources sought announcement is for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, experience, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work. The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a sole source or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
<p>The project includes restoration of the decorative finishes and gilded cast plaster ornaments (including conservation of original burnished water gilding) on the walls in the Senate Reception Room (S-213) next to the Senate Chamber in the United States Capitol.</p>
<p>The Senate Reception Room, which contains previously conserved frescoes and murals by Constantino Brumidi, is one of the most ornately decorated rooms in the Capitol. <br />The elaborate cast plaster decoration on the walls and ceiling was created in 1857 by ornamental plasterer Ernest Thomas. The decorative painting was carried out in early 1857 in subtle colors harmonizing with the figurative murals. Gold leaf was applied to the cast plaster ornaments by Francois Hugot in 1857 and 1858 with burnished water gilding on highlighted areas. Over the past 150 years the walls have been subject to damage and have been coarsely re-gilded and repainted in inaccurate and dark colors.</p>
<p>A 2009 - 2011 project to research, test, and analyze the gilded wall surfaces of the room was conducted, resulting in thorough report on the decorative finishes and gilding layers. The study was the basis for a pilot restoration that included all of the types of decorative elements on the west wall that will serve as the basis for the restoration of all of the similar elements in the room.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to conserve as much of the water gilding as possible and to clean and repair the plaster ornament to recover the fine details and regild and tone. The subtle colors and finishes of the surrounding decorative painting, including trompe l'oeil moldings and carved Greek key designs on the walls from the cornice level to the floor, are to be replicated and to match the pilot treatment area. Some further paint analysis will be required. Excluded are the previously conserved panels with cherubs (putti) and eagles and the scagliola dado, which must be carefully protected.</p>
<p>Access will be dependent on the schedule of the United States Senate. Flexibility is required, with best access in evenings or on weekends or recesses. The work will be divided into phases dependent on access and funding and will require multiple mobilizations.</p>
<p>The work is to be performed by a Key Person/Project Director who is a senior gilding conservator with extensive experience conserving nineteenth-century gilding in historic public buildings and a Professional Associate or Fellow of the American Institute for Conservation and is skilled in scientific testing and microscopic analysis. The Key Person/Project Director will conduct and direct restoration of the gilding and oversee the replication of historic decorative surfaces based on areas already replicated by decorative painters skilled and experienced in recreating nineteenth-century finishes which require subtle glazes. The Key Person/Project director is required to be on site the majority of the time that work is under way. All members of the team working on site will be required to submit to a security check and to wear identification badges at all times.</p>
<p>The capability package submitted shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity. Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall provide the resume of the project director (senior gilding conservator) responsible on the similar projects. All response shall include the following information: (1) company name and address; (2) point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; and (3) business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc).</p>
<p>Capability statements are to be submitted no later than June 20, 2012.</p>
<p>Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Jerrod Whittington by e-mail at jwhittin@aoc.gov.</p>

Sample tracking technologies of particular interest involve those that support the tracking of samples collected in the field, possibly without access to ground power or communications capabilities, but are compatible with those assets when available.  Technologies must be non-cumbersome, relatively inexpensive, and operate under a wide range of environmental conditions.   The scope of the information that is being sought covers the tracking of biological samples from matrices, to include but not be limited to, soil, water, insect vectors, vegetation, aerosol, blood, veterinary and zoonotic specimens, and recovery of biological materials from surfaces such as buildings and transportation systems.  Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond.<br><br>PART I - Technical Criteria.<br><br>The sample tracking systems should be able to track environmental samples containing biological materials (e.g. soil, water, insect vectors, vegetation, aerosol, blood, veterinary and zoonotic specimens, and recovery of biological materials from surfaces such as buildings and transportation systems). Sample tracking systems should be capable of being integrated into DoD systems for automated delivery of a wide range of sample metadata.  This request for information is focused solely on the tracking of materials and is not seeking information on other capabilities such as information management within sample repositories.  Specific information of interest are as follows:<br><br>-Technical description of tracking system <br>-Commercially recommended applications <br>-System component costs (in $US dollars)<br>-Cost per tracking event (if applicable)<br>-System weight and dimensions (where applicable)<br>-Component performance under varying environmental conditions<br>-Commercial availability in worldwide regions (i.e. limited in global markets/ITAR restrictions)<br>-Training requirements to utilize system<br>-Maintenance requirements for system (if applicable)<br><br>PART II - Submission of Information. - Vendors desiring to respond to this request should provide a white paper as follows:<br><br>White Paper: Limit the number of pages to four (4) total (Times New Roman, Font 12, one inch margins) excluding cover and photos which can be included separately.  Describe sample tracking system or kit including, at a minimum, the specific information of interest stated in Part I. Other information of potential interest that vendors could include current and investigational applications of product, future commercial developments, references that document recovery and efficiency of the system or product, and photographs of complete system and components.  <br><br>To be responsive to this announcement a vendor must supply their information as requested by 25 June 2012 as a Microsoft Word document. The recipient email address is: usarmy.APG.ecbc.mbx.cbrn-datacall@mail.mil .   At least one image of the sample collection systems should be submitted as a jpeg file with email file sizes not to exceed 3 megabytes. Vendors are requested to provide the name of Contact Person for their company, telephone number, FAX number, email and complete address with each submission of data.<br><br>The U.S. Army is under no obligation to select any participating technologies.  <br>

The Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Network Contracting Office (NCO) 10, Dayton, OH anticipates award of an indefinite quantity FIRM FIXED PRICE contract. The purpose of this contract is to engage a community provider (Contractor) who will provide emergency housing to Veterans along with services consistent with Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program objectives.

The HCHV Program, an essential and critical part of VHA, is vital for providing a gateway to VA and community supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless.  The HCHV Contract Residential Program for homeless Veterans is a vital program focused on addressing the needs of the most vulnerable and at-risk homeless Veterans.  Ensuring that Veterans can be placed in community-based programs which provide quality housing and services that meet the needs of this special population is a particular focus of the HCHV program.

The Contractor shall be capable to provide:

<DESC>VISN 3 seeks sources for the provision of a centralized storage and backup for digital images that will be acquired at each dental facility in the VISN. Dental Sensors must interface with an acquisition computer, linked to a local server that includes the software to organize and store the images. The images must also interface with Vista Imaging. The local server will interface with a central server which will be accessible by each facility to both upload and download. The system must meet the following requirements. 

1. The local computers interface with the digital dental sensors (another product) to acquire the images. 

2. The images interface with a dental imaging software product that keeps the images organized in the same order as taken. 

3. The software must interface with Vista Imaging as well as Dental Record Manager. 

4. Dental Record Manager is the official program that interfaces with the medical record (CPRS). 

5. Vista Imaging is the imaging program within our medical record system but does not have the capability to keep the dental images in an organized manner as does the software we need to have. 

6. Five Individual Servers will be stationed to serve each of the 10 facilities (1 for East Orange, Lyons, and Brick, 1 for Northport, 1 for Montrose and Castle Point, 1 for Manhattan, and 1 for Brooklyn and St. Albans. 

7. Each of these servers will interface with the acquisition computers (into which the sensors are plugged with a USB interface). 

8. These servers backup to a centralized server which is bidirectional. This will allow us to download as well as upload images. 



This request is for information purposes only. No contract or other legally binding document or order will be awarded as a result of this RFI. Any respondents bear full responsibility for the costs of response preparation.
Inquiries regarding this RFI must be made in writing to the Contracting Officer, Stephanie Bellanger, at stephanie.bellanger@va.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). The Marine Corps Systems Command seeks to identify sources capable of providing currently available non-proprietary equipment and software including Commercial Off-the-Shelf, Non-Developmental Items, and Government Off-the-Shelf components to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Commanders Information Operations plans for the CESAS II ground electronic attack capability. The system will support missions in detecting, denying, degrading, or delaying threshold signals of interest or signal types. This RFI seeks vendors with capabilities that can meet system capabilities described herein with little or no modification to existing technologies.  

Description The desired system should conduct reactive, preemptive, automatic, and manual functions that detect, deny, degrade, or delay Signals of Interest (SOI) or signal types.
 The system is required to be re-configurable for detection and mission execution of the SOI or signal type contained in the mission tasking message. System functionality may include support for software parameters download and re-configuration of software defined hardware equipment in order to prosecute new mission tasking utilizing Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) defined or detailed in the new tasking message. The system shall determine utilization factors and existing resources, and will handle new mission tasking. The system should determine whether utilization factors require re-allocation of resources based on new task priority vice current missions execution tasking. 

The TTPs should be agnostic of layer 1 (Physical Layer) or layer 2 (Data Link Layer) in the Open System Interconnection protocol stack or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol stack.
 The basis for the architecture implementation should be open scalable standards. Open standards based middleware should be used to convert the TTPs to Platform Specific Module(s) that in turn handle layer 1 and layer 2 details such as the modulation scheme, protocol reservation scheme (Time Division Multiple Access, Frequency Division Multiple Access, Code Division Multiple Access, etc.), and forward or reverse management schemes (in-band or out-of-band signaling schemes). Examples of open scalable standards are the Software Defined Radio, Object Management Group, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Joint Program Executive Office documents, and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Standards.
  

The system should be capable of adjusting the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) via the Algorithms and TTPs such that the cyclic nature of the ERP is controllable and adaptive and is sufficient for mission execution while maintaining Power Amplifier efficiency at different power output levels. Re-configuring antenna(s) via software control should help reduce Radio Frequency-fratricide by selecting an appropriate antenna pattern. The system should reply to originator of new mission tasking with estimated effective radiated power and antenna pattern required for completing new mission tasking (via utilization of specific antenna pattern chosen based on TTPs selected to be most effective given mission parameters).

System Algorithms and TTPs should allow collection of algorithms and TTPs Measurements of Effectiveness (MOEs) for analysis.
 On-line library descriptions of target(s) at layer 1 and layer 2 in the protocol stack shall assist the Operator in determining cause and effect of using a specified technique or procedure. The MOE alerts will display to the Operator for determination of appropriate TTP for the mission scenario. The MOE collection and analysis shall not affect performance of mission scenario. 

The system shall be compatible with the five Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter elements in Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 6212.01E: 
(1)	Compliant solution architecture; 
(2)	Compliance with net-centric data and services strategies; 
(3)	Compliance with applicable Global Information Grid and Technical Guidance; 
(4)	Compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance requirements; and
(5)	Compliance with supportability requirements, to include spectrum utilization and information bandwidth requirements, Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module, and the JTRS, as applicable.
 

Tagging of all exchanged system data shall be in accordance with the Joint Technical Architecture in the DoD Information Technology Standards and Profile Registry standard for tagged data items (Extensible Markup Language (XML)). Registration of tags shall be in accordance with the DoD XML registry and clearinghouse policy implementation plan. 

The system components should provide stationary and on-the-move capabilities and should be lightweight, modular, scalable, reliable, cost effective, ruggedized, and economically sustainable. The desired system is not envisioned as a one-box solution, but as a modular functional-based system comprised of a collection of subsystems. The systems form factor may be such that the set of subsystems utilized to execute particular mission tasking can vary depending on mission parameters.
 The system should be able to withstand unimproved road conditions and rugged terrain. It should be capable of integration with multiple platform types. The desired system and equipment should be able to maintain a reliable operational status in garrison and combat operations. 

It is desired that the hardware and software be compliant with appropriate sections in, but not limited to, MIL-STD 130, 461F, 810F, 882, 1366E, 1472G (sec 5.9.11.3), SECNAVINST 5000.2E, and NAVSEAINST 8020.7C. 

The system will comply with current anti-tamper and information security requirements and be capable of evolving to meet state-of-the-art technology advances designed to protect information from unwanted exploitation as imposed by National, DoD, and joint policy.
 The system software should support the ability to constrain and control awareness of the existence of information. 

Instructions to Responders This announcement contains all information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are required. Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government information sufficient to determine actual capability.  Submissions should include a summary sheet with the following elements:

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying a need to identify aerial systems that can deliver tailored tactical ship to objective logistical support to ground units operating in a distributed environment.  This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public.
 However, proprietary information received in response to this market research shall be marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e) and will be safeguarded and protected in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Government is seeking suitable commercial items or developmental items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. Information on capable sources is sought for the following requirements:

The system is not limited to, but needs to have the following capabilities:

	Assist MCWL in investigating potential candidate concepts, key and enabling technologies and technology development efforts that can deliver total weights of at least 500 lbs in no less than 250 lbs packages to multiple locations.
 
	Technology should be able to provide ship to objective aerial resupply of geographically distributed combat units autonomously.  For certain operations or phases of operations, logistic support may be required from naval vessels located up to 50 nautical miles from the shore.
	Given the need for flexibility over a broad range of operational conditions, the specific requirements for the unmanned air vehicle are not rigidly defined and are provided as advisory in nature.  These potential systems may have a Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) capability, but it is not mandatory.  

The purpose of this RFI is to inform MCWL of technologies and concepts relevant to this capability and determine what technology development investments might be appropriate to support future MCWL experimentation.

In response to significant changes to the nature of combat operations across the range of conflicts, the USMC has identified the need to create a family of flexible and scalable aerial systems that would enable an enhanced MAGTF to support two platoons of a Company Landing Team (CLT) operating in a distributed environment.
  Although the typical size of an individual combat unit requiring logistic support is a Marine Corps company, the flexibility to occasionally resupply smaller units may also prove beneficial. Logistics support may be required from naval vessels directly to tactical ground maneuver units.

Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.
 These expressions of interest shall adhere to a two (2) pages submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links and all should be submitted via email to arlene.fitzpatrick@usmc.mil referencing the following solicitation number: M6785412R7305.  These should be submitted on or before 2 July 2012.   

This sources sought is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this Notice, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.

<DESC>June 4, 2012<br />Advisory # 120604-5 <br />AFITC 2012 Canceled <br />MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE-GUNTER ANNEX, Ala. &ndash; Due to budgetary concerns, the Office of the Undersecretary of the United States Air Force has disapproved the 2012 Air Force Information Technology Conference (AFITC). <br /><br />The mission of the AFITC is to facilitate conversations, interactions and activities which keep Air Force and industry IT users, developers and managers current on progressive best practices to enable more integrated and lethal capabilities to our warfighter. Held annually in Montgomery, Ala., this year&rsquo;s conference was scheduled to be held Aug 27-29. The principal driver for the cancelation is the travel cost for Air Force and government attendees, which is approximately $1.4 million. <br /><br />The Air Force is always focused on the proper stewardship of taxpayer funds. Currently, financial resources are heavily constrained, and this has increased the amount of scrutiny over Air Force sponsored and co-sponsored events. This scrutiny was highlighted in a recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum, which also encouraged government agencies to identify and implement creative and innovative practices to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in such areas such as travel and conferences. <br /><br />The conference has been held annually since 1983; however, it was canceled in 1985, 1988, 1990, 1991 and 2005, also for budgetary concerns. <br /><br />For more information about AFITC feel free to contact Jason Bishop by email at jason.bishop.ctr@gunter.af.mil or by phone at (334) 416-4290

<CONTACT>Vanessa Lechon, Phone 8056052484, Email vanessa.lechon@vandenberg.af.mil
<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-11-C-0025, Substation Maintenance for a period of six months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 30 September 2012 and ending 29 March 2013. This extension is needed to satisfy the 30th Space Wing's (30SW) Substation Maintenance requirement until award of a new solicitation FA4610-11-R-0037 can be completed. Not awarding a six-month extension would cause serious injury to the Government. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, Siemens Industry, 1000 Deerfield Pkwy Buffalo Grove IL 60089-4547. A full and open competitive acquisition was awarded on 19 Sep 2011 to provide Substation Maintenance for the 30SW, Vandenberg AFB, CA. The Substation Maintenance provides scheduled, preventive and predictive diagnostic maintenance services for nine substations connected to the 70kV transmission system on VAFB. This contract also includes minor repairs and limited emergency response actions in support of the 30th Civil Engineer Squadron (30 CES). The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg AFB operations described above. This six-month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The re-compete action is slated to be awarded sometime in June 2013. This contract extension will further allow for the current procurement under FA4610-11-R-0037 to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to the next contractor. Siemens Industry is the only responsible offeror for the extension of the contract, as the Government would experience a stop in service that is detrimental to fulfilling the agency's requirements if the current contract is not extended prior to the current expiration date of 29 September 2012. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to the extension of the contract under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source, within 15 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend the current contract and not compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend the contract. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Vanessa Lech&oacute;n at e-mail address Vanessa.Lechon@vandenberg.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 7, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 1266 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, CA 94086-5206 on or around July 30, 2012 to provide a da Vinci Si-Dual Console Surgical Robot System and corresponding year-long maintenance services.  Sources Sought Notice VA247-12-I-0322 was issued on April 5, 2012 to seek out a potential contractor to provide a system with equal salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics.  No responses had been received when the notice closed on April 20, 2012.  The components of the da Vinci dual-console surgical system are as follows:  
"	Two (2) surgeon consoles to each include: high resolution stereo display, left master controller, right master controller, foot switch panel, and surgeon console to vision cart cable (each with a one year warranty);
"	Patient cart to include: patient cart, three (3) instrument arms, one camera arm, and one patient cart to vision cart table (each with a one year warranty);
"	System vision cart to include vision enhancement kit (each with a one year warranty);
"	User manual;
"	System software (one year warranty);
"	Da Vinci skills simulator equipment list to include: one skills simulator unit, one blue fiber cable, and one audio cable (each with a one year warranty);
"	Accessory starter kit to include: three (3) arm drape kit (5 pack), four (4) arm drape kit (5 pack), twenty (20) instrument arm drapes, twenty (20) camera head drapes, twenty (20) camera arm drapes, twenty (20) monitor drapes, 8mm cannula seals (box of 10), 8mm cannula (box of 3), cannula gage pin, blunt obturator, blade protector, allen wrench, and spare lamp module (each with a ninety (90) day warranty);

The da Vinci dual console surgical system allows two surgeons to simultaneously perform robotic surgeries.  The vision cart provides the surgeons with a minimally invasive 3D view of the surgical field including depth, magnification, and high resolution.  The patient cart includes robotic arms designed to mimic the movements of human hands, wrists, and fingers.  The extensive range of motion allows surgical precision that is not possible in standard minimally invasive procedures.  The surgeon consoles contain the controls that the surgeons use to manipulate the robotic arms; its handles translate the surgeons' natural hand and wrist movements into corresponding precise and scaled movements.  

NAICS Code: 339112 (Size Standard 500 employees)

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:
The National Park Service, Alaska Region intends to award a sole source contract to Washington State University for the following services:
Perform diet analyses from excreta collected from Western Arctic Herd caribou.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background:  The laboratory that is being requested has been utilized by ARCN in the past.  Diet analyses are known to be subject to lab/observer biases.  To minimize this bias, diet analyses should be performed by the same lab/observer. 1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Washington State University (WSU)'s Wildlife Habitat and Nutrition Laboratory has been the sole lab to conduct fecal analyses to determine the diets of Western Arctic Caribou Herd since at least 2005, including recently completed (7/2011) analyses performed for ARCN parks. 
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.
WSU shall perform diet analyses from excreta collected from Western Arctic Herd caribou.  They have performed this task well previously for the NPS and this herd, dating back to 2005.  The diet analyses from WSU's lab are the best we have found to meet the needs of our project goals.  WSU lab meets or exceeds analysis specification.  WSU provides excellent documentation of their findings.
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  Diet analyses are subject to laboratory variability.  In order to maintain the highest level of data quality and control, continuity of vendors is extremely important.  Although there are other vendors that perform diet analyses, WSU has been the vendor of choice for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd since at least 2005, several other prior purchase orders will attest to this.
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  To ensure compatibility, reliability and repeatability of diet analyses, we request WSU as the vendor, and waive further research.
 This purchase will be made under FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Item" and FAR Part 15, " Other Than Full and Open Competition is authorized by FAR 6.302-1. The value of this contract is not expected to exceed $28,000.  The anticipated award date is 22 June 2012.
Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirement are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the product/services listed above. Deadline date for the submittals is 21 June 2012 at 12 pm Alaska Standard Time.
A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

For information regarding this purchase, contact Deryl Morse at (907) 644-3313 or deryl_morse@nps.gov.

Universal Music  MGB NA is considered the only source that can provide a license for a searchable library of licensed music for use in creation of non-broadcast multi-media productions for internal use by the Navy.  A change of vendors would require notification of each of the users, recovery of the loaned hard drives, re-registration of the same users for a different service, re-training of users according to the requirements of a new vendor, and redistribution of any copyrighted media.  Completion of this process would have to be coordinated with mission execution with delay of up to several weeks and would cause extra costs to be incurred in employee time.  The burden imposed by such a change would impact our mission to a significant degree.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA/OAR Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Wood Mackenzie of Boston, MA for one-year subscriptions to three (3) Wood Mackenzie coal service subscriptions: (1) "Long Term US Steam Coal Outlook" (2) "Western Coal (PRB/WB)" and (3) "Coal Supply Service - US Appalachia."
The justification is as follows. These subscriptions are needed to support the Agency"s review of a draft update of the coal supply curves used by EPA in the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) of the U.S. power sector.  Those supply curves, were developed for EPA in 2009 and updated in 2012 by Wood Mackenzie.  EPA requires the three Wood Mackenzie coal service subscriptions because they use the same underlying approach employed in the development of EPA"s coal supply curves.  No other coal projection would provide the required consistency in approach.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of June 19, 2012, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contract specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business.  It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form.  The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.<br><br>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment.  WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world.  Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office.  WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.<br><br>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies.  They cannot be "lost" or  "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site.  Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing.  Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays.  WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.<br><br>There are no costs involved to get you started.  Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way.  To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system.  This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA.  Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions.  Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist.  Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil.   (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)<br><br><br>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions  <br>Installation and Registration Checklist <br><br>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to  activation of the firm and user accounts.<br><br>1.	Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.  <br><br> 	If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below.  <br> 	For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br>888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.  <br><br>2.	Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  <br><br> 	All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/.  <br> 	Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.).  <br> 	Note:  All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.  Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.  <br><br>3.	Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).  <br><br> 	The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.  You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.  <br> 	To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on "Search CCR."  Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query."  If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.  <br> 	Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.  There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.  If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it.  <br> 	Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination.  <br> 	The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.  <br> 	Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.  Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.  For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html  <br><br>4.  Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).  <br><br> 	In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM.  <br> 	A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.  <br> 	The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.  To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.  <br> 	The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.  <br> 	The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.  <br> 	The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.  <br><br>5.	 Establish an organizational email address<br><br> 	All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account.  <br> 	The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.  <br> 	Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.  <br> 	Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.  <br><br>6.   Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br> 	Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br> 	Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information:  https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.  <br><br>7.   Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br> 	Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br> 	Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br> 	Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br> 	PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br> 	If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br> 	Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base. <br><br>8.  Follow-up (if necessary).<br><br> 	If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center: <br><br>TOLL FREE - 1-866-618-5988, Option 8<br>COMMERCIAL - 801-777-3282, Option 8 <br>DSN - 777-3282 Option 1 <br>FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br>Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br>Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.<br><br><br>WIDE AREA WORKFLOW - RECEIPT AND ACCEPTANCE (WAWF-RA)<br>ELECTRONIC RECEIVING REPORT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>IN ACCORDANCE WITH DFARS 232.7002, USE OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT REQUESTS IS MANDATORY.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corporation for purchase of the following items: AKTAPurifier 10 Goldseal (part 28961828), FRAC-920 Fraction Collector (part 18117740), and HP8200 Elite Raid1 Win 7 with Mon (PART 29005607). This unit is needed for ion exchange chromatography, and its pumps are robust enough to withstand salt buffers necessary in protein purification. Ability to withstand salt buffers is the primary requrement for this unit. This instrument allows flow rates from 0.001ml/min to 10ml/min to allow for purification of microgram to milligram quantities of protein. Purchase of this unit will also maintain consistency and compatibility with GE AKTA units designed for ion exchange or size exclusion already in use at CDC. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may use e-mail to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement before the expiration date of the advertisement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Pediatric Diapers. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) North is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is November 2012. </strong>The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><br /><strong>Point of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil 571-231-5451 and Ms. Caroline Howard, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, caroline.d.howard@us.army.mil 571-231-5905.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Pediatric Diapers. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $330,506.44. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, forty six (46) of the total fifty five (55) line items represent the top seven (7) products and account for 97.68% ($322,828.93) of the total volume in sales $330,506.44 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Lead, at toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and Ms. Caroline Howard, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, caroline.d.howard@us.army.mil 571-231-5905.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that submission, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p><br />Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Pediatric Diapers products. <br />a. At a minimum the vendor must provide the following diapers ranging in size from fitting a pediatric patient weighing from 0 to 6 lbs through weighing over 35 lbs, latex free/safe, hypoallergenic, having expandable gatherings at both the waist and leg openings, having waist adhesive fasteners and having a leak-free outer backing.</p>
<p>Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 0 to 6 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 6 to 14 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 12 to 18 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 16 to 28 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 22 to 37 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of over 27 lbs<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of over 35 lbs<br />*Operational usage items are included in this list of Pediatric Diapers</p>
<p>b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via Microsoft Excel spread sheet, and a product catalog and literature, in response to this RFIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items in all sizes and product types.<br />2. Vendor must provide a Children's Product Certificate (CPC); this written certification must be based upon passing test results obtained from the required third party testing at a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission accepted laboratory.<br />3. Vendor must have an affixed "tracking label" on the product and/or its packaging that contains certain basic information, including the name of the manufacturer or private labeler; the location and date of production of the product; detailed information on the manufacturing process, such as a batch or run number, or other identifying characteristics; and any other information to facilitate ascertaining the specific source of the product.<br />4. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Pediatric Diapers. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number has been applied for. <br />5. Vendor must have agreements for Pediatric Diapers with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR (i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor), or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />6. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO North, on behalf of the CPT, will request product samples to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00 PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO North verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Two (2) packages (or 40 diapers each) in the size listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>Item Description, Size, and Quantity<br />Pediatric Diapers for a patient weighing within the range of 6 to 14 lbs, (2) packages (or 40 diapers each)</p>
<p>During the acquisition planning process, the CPT determined/approved the product line samples required for the acceptability evaluation. Clinical trials will be conducted in a patient treatment setting. Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately sixteen (16) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Patient Safety/CDC 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions) The Pediatric Diaper draws wetness away from patient's skin. The Pediatric Diaper must have the ability to draw wetness away from patient's skin. This assists in the prevention of skin breakdown/damage due to contact with skin irritants (i.e. bodily fluids). <br />2. (Patient Safety/CDC 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions) The re-sealable closure tabs should maintain adhesiveness after multiple opening and closing maneuvers. The Pediatric Diaper must have the ability for its closure tabs to maintain adhesiveness to allow for frequent skin assessment without altering the diaper's proper position and fit.<br />3. (Patient Safety/CDC 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions) The Pediatric Diaper maintains its structure during use. The Pediatric Diaper must remain intact to protect patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids. <br />4. (Patient Safety/CDC 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions) The Pediatric Diaper's waist and leg bands provide a tailored non-leak fit. The Pediatric Diaper's waist and leg bands must adapt to various widths in providing a non-leak comfortable fit. A non-leak fit aids in the prevention of wetness to linen/clothing and other body parts, thus minimizing skin irritation.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO North and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) Non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, and equipment to fabricate and deliver a non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>NIST's Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division has a requirement for a non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller to measure the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of the neutron using Bragg reflection from two separately polished silicon crystals. One must align the Bragg planes of the crystals to high angular precision (+/- 100 nanoradians). The MDM measurement is sensitive to magnetic field gradients, thus the stage must be composed of non-magnetic materials. If this MDM measurement is successful, we will use the stage in a novel measurement of the neutron EDM, an important quantity in limiting extensions to the standard model of particle physics.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller, which shall meet or exceed the specifications identified below.</p>
<p>1. The positioning stage shall be driven by a piezoelectric with independent control over the tip, tilt and control of one axis of translation.</p>
<p>2. The positioning stage shall have:<br />a. angular resolution for both the tip and tilt better than 100 nanoradians;<br />b. a tip and tilt repeatability of better than 50 nanoradians;<br />c. tip and tilt angular travel range of at least plus or minus 0.3 mrad;<br />d. linearity better than 0.04 per cent.</p>
<p>3. The positioning stage shall have:<br />a. translation travel of at least 0.05 mm;<br />b. a translation resolution of better than 1nm;<br />c. linearity better than 0.04 per cent;<br />d. a translation repeatability of better than 2 nm.</p>
<p>4. The position sensors for the stage shall be capacitive so as to enable the above specifications.</p>
<p>5. The body of the stage shall be made of a non-magnetic material, and shall not have a magnetic surface coating (such as a Ni-based anodization).</p>
<p>6. Titanium (or other suitable non-magnetic material such as brass or aluminum) shall be substituted for all components fabricated from stainless steel or other magnetic materials (such as Invar).</p>
<p>7. The dimensions of the stage shall be: <br />a. width less than 155 mm;<br />b. height less than 155 mm;<br />c. thickness less than 18 mm.</p>
<p>8. The surface of the stage shall have mounting holes. The stage shall have a clear aperture that is at least 70 mm by 70 mm that is centered in the stage.</p>
<p>9. The stage shall come with a programmable controller. <br />a. The controller software must run natively on Windows XP and Windows 7 operating systems. <br />b. The software for the controller must include Windows dynamic link libraries (DLL) and Labview VIs. <br />c. Options for communication between the controller and a computer must include USB and RS-232. <br />d. The software shall come with a manual describing the programming functions.</p>
<p>10. The cables connecting the controller and the stage shall be at least a total of 10 m in length. If the cables are hardwired to the stage, the cables shall be in two parts; the length of the cables hardwired to the stage must be between 1 m and 2 m in length, terminating in a connector block (for instance, D-sub). A second cable set 8 m to 10 m in length shall connect the controller to the connector. If required to maintain resolution, a sensor readout or amplification stage may be positioned between the extension cable and the hardwired cable.</p>
<p>Express Warranty</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide a standard commercial warranty.</p>
<p>Delivery</p>
<p>FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place in accordance with Contractor's commercial schedule. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>

<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 279</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices. The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa, and Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs). PRAs serve as the regional team leaders in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional office, as applicable, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Regional Coordinators and the OFDA Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington, the multi-year strategies for their respective regions. In coordination with OFDA/Washington, PRAs manage disaster response activities, identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.</p>
<p>The Southern Africa Regional Office in Pretoria, South Africa, covers 12 countries in Southern Africa. The region is largely comprised of poor, food insecure nations, and politically unstable and failing states with diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a PRA for its regional office in Pretoria, South Africa, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR) are met.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The PRA will actively develop and coordinate disaster responses as well as ongoing preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in affected regions. Frequent travel throughout Southern Africa will be required.</p>
<p>The Principal Regional Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W), the PRA will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the DCHA/OFDA lead representative and the primary point of contact on OFDA -related matters in the assigned region;<br />&bull; Manage the regional office in Pretoria, supervise all office staff; and ensure all staff receive appropriate OFDA training;<br />&bull; Travel to disaster locations and/or areas of potential disasters and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; provide representational backstopping support to the DART team leaders;<br />&bull; Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with USAID/W; provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of all disaster, humanitarian, and emergency events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of host government, donor governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. embassies and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor OFDA-funded activities, to ensure objectives are being met and beneficiaries are being served; <br />&bull; Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;<br />&bull; Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of DARTs and assessment teams with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs or assessment teams when appropriate; may serve as the Team Leader, as necessary;<br />&bull; Maintain communications, while on travel, with their respective regional/sub-regional offices and OFDA/W, as necessary; <br />&bull; Under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader, coordinate with OFDA/W and other OFDA relevant regional offices, and prepare information requirements and reports.</p>
<p>2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the PRA, in collaboration with colleagues in OFDA/W regional teams, and under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare or supervise the preparation of, regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;<br />&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID officials on disaster response, mitigation and risk reduction efforts, including the review of sector disaster response and DRM and DRR plans;<br />&bull; Provide support, as required, for other DRM and DRR initiatives in the assigned region. Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries, and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The PRA works under the supervision of, and reports directly to, the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W, or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The PRA is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The Disaster Response Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Afghanistan (various field posts)</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 17 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In July 2009, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched the first phase of its current program in Afghanistan to support the U.S. Government's stabilization and reconstruction initiatives. The objective of the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) was to address instability by fostering and strengthening conditions that build links between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and local Afghan communities. In close coordination with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the OTI program has increasingly supported communities in violence-prone areas where stabilization projects are needed most.</p>
<p>In March 2012, OTI began the second phase of OTI's current engagement in Afghanistan. Through the Community Cohesion Initiative (CCI), USAID/Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) seeks to improve stability in areas vulnerable to insurgent exploitation in order to create an enabling environment for sustainable peace and traditional development programs by (1) strengthening ties between local actors, customary governance structures, and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and (2) empowering community-based resiliencies to mitigate sources of instability.</p>
<p>Grounded in the principle that durable stability is a result of local will, empowerment, initiative, and leadership, OTI designs and implements clusters of small grants through a process-oriented, community driven approach. In OTI programming the project processes are as important as project outputs in contributing to the program's strategic goal of stabilization. OTI utilizes both "soft" (community-leadership shuras, District Governor outreach visits) and "hard" (small scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities vulnerable to insurgent exploitation and positive GIRoA influencers. Community resiliencies are strengthened by improving their ability to resolve issues, promote viable economic activity, and communicate effectively within the community and with various government entities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI/Afghanistan team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI/Afghanistan program.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Field Officer is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative (CR) or his/her designee, which may include the OTI Deputy Country Representative (DCR) or OTI Senior Field Program Manager (S/FPM), and is based in Afghanistan. This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance will be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>The OTI Field Officer's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program. The exact locations for these positions has not been determined, but the majority will be based outside of Kabul with a civilian Regional Platform, a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) or a District Stabilization Team (DST) housed in Forward Operating Bases established, led and maintained by U.S. or NATO/ISAF military forces. The OTI Field Officer is expected to be in daily communication and collaboration with a variety of U.S. or NATO/ISAF military units including U.S. Special Forces.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Field Officer requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.

The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

As used in this clause--<br><br>Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item-<br><br>(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is--<br><br>(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);<br><br>(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and<br><br>(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and<br><br>(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.<br><br>Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into a construction material.<br><br>Construction material means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.<br><br>Cost of components means--<br><br>(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or<br><br>(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit.

Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic; or<br><br>(ii) The construction material is a COTS item.<br><br>Foreign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material.<br><br>United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.<br><br>(b) Domestic preference. <br><br>(1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for construction material that is a COTS item (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause.<br><br>(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item or to the construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows:<br><br>(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that<br><br>(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent;<br><br>(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or<br><br>(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.<br><br>(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including--<br><br>(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials;<br><br>(B) Unit of measure;<br><br>(C) Quantity;<br><br>(D) Price;<br><br>(E) Time of delivery or availability;<br><br>(F) Location of the construction project;<br><br>(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and<br><br>(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.<br><br>(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.<br><br>(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued).<br><br>(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.<br><br>(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause.<br><br>(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act.<br><br>(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:<br><br>                          Foreign and Domestic Construction Materials Price Comparison<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>  Construction material description        Unit of measure              Quantity           Price (dollars) \1\<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Item 1<br>    Foreign construction material....  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>    Domestic construction material...  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>Item 2<br>    Foreign construction material....  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>    Domestic construction material...  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued).<br>List name, address, telephone number, and contact for suppliers surveyed.

The ILC shall provide that, unless the issuer provides the beneficiary written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days in advance of the current expiration date, the ILC is automatically extended without amendment for one year from the expiration date, or any future expiration date, until the period of required coverage is completed and the Contracting Officer provides the financial institution with a written statement waiving the right to payment.

App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.<br><br>Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into a construction material.<br><br>Construction material means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.<br><br>Cost of components means--<br><br>(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or<br><br>(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the <br>manufacture of the construction material.<br><br>Domestic construction material means--<br><br>(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States;<br><br>(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if--<br><br>(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for construction material that is a COTS item (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause.<br><br>(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item or to the construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows:<br><br>(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that<br><br>(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent;<br><br>(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or<br><br>(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.<br><br>(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including--<br><br>(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials;<br><br>(B) Unit of measure;<br><br>(C) Quantity;<br><br>(D) Price;<br><br>(E) Time of delivery or availability;<br><br>(F) Location of the construction project;<br><br>(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and<br><br>(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.<br><br>(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.<br><br>(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued).<br><br>(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.<br><br>(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause.<br><br>(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act.<br><br>(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:<br><br>                          Foreign and Domestic Construction Materials Price Comparison<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>  Construction material description        Unit of measure              Quantity           Price (dollars) \1\<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Item 1<br>    Foreign construction material....  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>    Domestic construction material...  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>Item 2<br>    Foreign construction material....  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>    Domestic construction material...  .......................  .......................  .......................<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued).<br>List name, address, telephone number, and contact for suppliers surveyed.

The ILC shall provide that, unless the issuer provides the beneficiary written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days in advance of the current expiration date, the ILC is automatically extended without amendment for one year from the expiration date, or any future expiration date, until the period of required coverage is completed and the Contracting Officer provides the financial institution with a written statement waiving the right to payment.

(b) The Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government. Nor does the Government assume responsibility for any understanding reached or representation made concerning conditions which can affect the work by any of its officers or agents before the execution of this contract, unless that understanding or representation is expressly stated in this contract.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 2JUN2012 1200 EST.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>OTI implements short-term, quick-impact programs that aim to increase stability and affect positive political development. Violence has reached extreme rates in Honduras over the last several years, driven by a combination of local and transnational crime perpetrated by individual actors, gangs, and transnational organized criminal groups. There is space in Honduras for transition programming, focused on positively affecting the current security situation through the implementation of small, tangible grants supporting community-based momentum towards positive change.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Deputy Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull; Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Honduras, the work is generally performed in an office environment. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 17 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In July 2009, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched the first phase of its current program in Afghanistan to support the U.S. Government's stabilization and reconstruction initiatives. The objective of the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) was to address instability by fostering and strengthening conditions that build links between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and local Afghan communities. In close coordination with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the OTI program has increasingly supported communities in violence-prone areas where stabilization projects are needed most.</p>
<p>In March 2012, OTI began the second phase of OTI's current engagement in Afghanistan. Through the Community Cohesion Initiative (CCI), USAID/Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) seeks to improve stability in areas vulnerable to insurgent exploitation in order to create an enabling environment for sustainable peace and traditional development programs by (1) strengthening ties between local actors, customary governance structures, and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and (2) empowering community-based resiliencies to mitigate sources of instability.</p>
<p>Grounded in the principle that durable stability is a result of local will, empowerment, initiative, and leadership, OTI designs and implements clusters of small grants through a process-oriented, community driven approach. In OTI programming the project processes are as important as project outputs in contributing to the program's strategic goal of stabilization. OTI utilizes both "soft" (community-leadership shuras, District Governor outreach visits) and "hard" (small scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities vulnerable to insurgent exploitation and positive GIRoA influencers. Community resiliencies are strengthened by improving their ability to resolve issues, promote viable economic activity, and communicate effectively within the community and with various government entities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI/Afghanistan team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI/Afghanistan program.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Field Officer is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative (CR) or his/her designee, which may include the OTI Deputy Country Representative (DCR) or OTI Senior Field Program Manager (S/FPM), and is based in Afghanistan. This post is not a family-accompanied post and does not allow minor or adult dependents, although a separate maintenance allowance will be authorized for incumbents with dependents.</p>
<p>The OTI Field Officer's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program. The exact locations for these positions has not been determined, but the majority will be based outside of Kabul with a civilian Regional Platform, a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) or a District Stabilization Team (DST) housed in Forward Operating Bases established, led and maintained by U.S. or NATO/ISAF military forces. The OTI Field Officer is expected to be in daily communication and collaboration with a variety of U.S. or NATO/ISAF military units including U.S. Special Forces.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Field Officer requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Field Officer requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The OTI Field Officer is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Field Officer is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The OTI Field Officer has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The OTI Field Officer is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative (CR) or his/her designee (e.g. the OTI Deputy Country Representative (DCR) or the Senior Field Program Manager (S/FPM), the OTI Field Officer will:</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE <br />MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE PRE- AND POST-MARKET REVIEW PRACTICES</p>
<p>FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: This is a Request For Information (RFI) being released pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10 Market Research. This is NOT a Request For Proposal, and nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the government to further action as a result of the RFI. In addition, contractors responding to this RFI shall bear all risks and expenses of any resources used to provide the requested information. The information collected through the process is considered to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002.</p>
<p>Background and Description of Requirement:</p>
<p>The Unites States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, re-label, and import medical devices sold in the United States. In addition, CDRH regulates radiation-emitting electronic products (medical and non-medical) such as lasers, x-ray systems, ultrasound equipment, microwave ovens and color televisions.</p>
<p>CDRH recognizes that increased uses of software in medical devices, software as medical devices and software used as a tool in producing devices (medical device software) is creating the need, for FDA to systematically reevaluate our existing pre- and post-market software review practices, to develop and implement, a plan that will enhance the way CDRH currently oversees medical device software. The goal of this effort is to use process improvement methods and tools to assess current CDRH software review practices with the goal of facilitating the development of innovative products, providing adequate patient protections, and enabling and promoting best practices for the review medical device software. To do so, CDRH needs to understand the current status and trends, including external best practices, in medical device software review practices. An external and internal assessment that highlights best practices for medical device software is required to enhance existing pre- and post-market software review practices to promote innovative technologies and provide a predictable regulatory environment that meets the needs of the medical device industry.</p>
<p>Specifically, CDRH seeks to understand current practices used in the medical device industry; compare best practices for software with those used by similar high risk industries; and understand the current strengths and weakness of FDA's programs (business processes) related to reasonably assuring safety and effectiveness of software used for healthcare.</p>
<p>1. Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is an assessment of current software best practices for medical device software. Medical device software is defined as software used in devices, software used as devices, and software used as a tool in the production of medical device. Assessment of software practices includes assessment of engineering, quality control and quality assurance practices used in the planning, design, development, deployment, maintenance of medical device software.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are interested in the exploring the following primary objectives:</p>
<p>1. Perform an External Evaluation of Current Software Practices in the Medical Device Industry as compared to other parallel industries and academia.</p>
<p>* Assessment of current software practices, including strengths, challenges, and opportunities applicable to the medical device industry.</p>
<p>* Evaluation and identification of medical device industry best software practices for medical devices.</p>
<p>* Assessment of current software practices for other parallel industries that use or make high risk and complex software products (e.g. aviation, finance, and nuclear), including but not limited to practices used to independently assure safety of software.</p>
<p>*Evaluation and identification of other parallel industries (e.g. aviation, finance, and nuclear) best software practices used in high risk and complex software products, including but not limited to practices used to independently assure safety of software.</p>
<p>*Evaluation and identification of emerging software practices from academia.</p>
<p>2. Perform an Internal Evaluation of CDRH's Current Medical Device Software Regulatory Practices.</p>
<p>*Assessment of current software review practices, including strengths, challenges, and opportunities, to include assessment of "people" (e.g. bench strength, skill sets, and organizational structure), "processes", and information technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>*Evaluation, identification and drill down on current review processes, significant challenges, including root cause analysis of roadblocks and inefficiencies. (e.g. include perspectives from CDRH staff that include Office of Compliance (OC), Office of Communication, Education, and Radiation Programs (OCER), Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB), Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device</p>
<p>*Evaluation and Safety (OIVD), Office of the Center Director (OCD), Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL), and field inspection staff at Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA).</p>
<p>*Evaluation and identification of improvement opportunities that will help assure the safety and effectiveness of software used in devices, software used as devices, and software used as a tool in producing devices</p>
<p>3. Perform an in-depth current state analysis of the external and internal evaluations of medical device software review practices to determine best-practices and develop a set of recommendations for existing pre- and post-market software review practices that will improve the way the Center currently reviews software.</p>
<p>* Analysis of gaps, process roadblocks, inefficiencies and opportunities in medical device software practices between medical device industry, academia and other parallel industries.</p>
<p>* Identify and recommend improvements that lead to desirable state of medical device software processes that includes enabling an environment for medical device software that focuses on patient safety while promoting innovative medical device technology.</p>
<p>* Analysis of gaps that indentifies improvement opportunities for CDRH in the areas that include "people" (e.g. bench strength, skill sets, and organizational structure), process, and information technology infrastructure that will enable effective oversight of medical device software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI shall provide the following information:</p>
<p>a) Firm's capability statement: Contractor background summary including, contractor name, DUNS, point of contact information, email, phone and 8(a) certification documentation, and any GSA and/or NASA schedule number, if applicable.<br />b) Past Performance- Provide a list of previous contracts where&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Process Improvement</span></strong>&nbsp;and other related support services were provided.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates that request for proposals (RFP) NHLBI-HV-12-09 will be available on or about March 31, 2011. The objective of the RFP is to continue Lentivirus Vector Production Core Laboratory (LCL) activities, which are part of the Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP), for five years. The purpose of the GTRP is to facilitate the translation of basic research in gene therapy to clinical application in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases. The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials.

THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
Sources Sought Notice for Small Business Search
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) in Denver, Colorado has a requirement to purchase a high-performance liquid chromatograph (LC)tandem quadrupole/high-resolution mass spectrometer system (MS/HRMS).
The USGS is seeking small business sources for a high-performance liquid chromatograph (LC)tandem quadrupole/high-resolution mass spectrometer system (MS/HRMS) that meets the following requirements:
1. The MS/HRMS subsystem of the LCMS/HRMS system shall be a tandem MS design with a quadrupole mass analyzer for the first stage of analysis and a high resolution, accurate mass analyzer for the second stage of analysis, with a fragmentation stage in between the two mass analyzer systems. Either a quadrupole/time-of-flight (QTOF) tandem MS system or a quadrupole/Orbitrap tandem MS system that achieves acceptable resolution and sensitivity will be considered. The high-resolution mass analyzer shall have resolution of greater than or equal to 15,000 ppm at m/z of 500 amu and with less than 2 ppm mass accuracy. An atmospheric pressure ionization source with liquid chromatography inlet, with electrospray ionization (ESI), capable of operating in both positive and negative ion mode, shall be provided. The ability to rapidly change from an ESI source to an atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source is required. 
2. The LCMS/HRMS system shall include an LC subsystem made of biologically inert, or bioinert components throughout its flow path and be capable of unattended injection ranging from less than 1 to 200 microliters from a temperature-controlled autosampler that can be operated at sub-ambient (to 10 &#61616;C below ambient) temperatures, and a binary gradient LC pump and thermostatted column system capable of operating at flow rates between 0.001 and 2 mL/min and operating pressures of at least 600 bar (8700 psi). 
3. A PC-based Data System, including 32/64-bit capable Windows 7 operating system,16 gigabytes of random access memory, and at a minimum one hard disk of 4 terabyte capacity (&#61619; 7200 rpm enterprise grade required); a separate enterprise-grade hard disk containing the Windows 7 operating system is  optional;  two high-resolution, 22-inch liquid crystal display (LC) monitors and two monitor cards to use both monitors concurrently for displaying the computer desktop; QWERTY keyboard and optical mouse; a DVD read/record drive; and an Instrument Control Software package that fully controls and automates all aspects of the LCMS/HRMS operation, including LC and MS/HRMS operation and control, sample analysis and data collection, and post-collection data processing.
4. The LCMS/HRMS system shall include a computer data system that fully controls the LC and MS/HRMS subsystems with full instrument control software and sufficient random-access memory and disk storage to manage the large files generated by the system. The system shall include data analysis software capable of distinguishing empirical formulae at a resolution of 15,000 ppm.  The software shall have additional capabilities to eliminate irrational chemical compositions (e.g. C2H50) and to eliminate elemental compositions specified by user.  The software shall use known isotopic abundance ratios and known mass defects of component elements as part of any algorithm that determines likely empirical formulae.  
5. Offerors will be required to provide analysis of a set of demonstration samples, provided by the USGS/NWQL, to show overall system performance.
The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to provide the above mentioned supply/service.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required supply/service or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required supply/service stated herein.

<DESC>This competitive action was awarded pursuant to NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH10ZEA001N-CTD2 entitled Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA)  2010, Concepts and Technology Development  Round 2 (CTD2), Amendment 7, Subtopic 2 Stochastic Models of Arrival Time Accurace and Transit Time Range for NextGen Operations in Super-Dense Airspace.  This research brings together complementary operational, human factors, modeling, and analysis expertise, to identify and characterize critical trajectory navigation capabilities, and assess and model these capabilities in representative NextGen terminal area scenarios to exercise the impacts on scheduling uncertainty.
