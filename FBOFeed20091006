<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  This opportunity is only available to the contractor  who was awarded  the contract for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04M3-S-09-8114, MEDICAL SPRINGS STEWARDSHIP, LAGRANDE RANGER DISTRICT, WALLOWA-WHITMAN NATIONAL FOREST.  The original solicitation was competitively advertised as an RFP.  This project will be partially funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto.       

The Medical Springs Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes road maintenance, road construction, ground-based logging, helicopter logging, thinning, pruning, and slash treatment.  The contract included bases items and some optional items.  Based on the funds available at the time of contract award, some of the thinning, pruning, and slash treatment were not awarded.  THE INTENT OF THIS DELIVERY ORDER IS TO ORDER THE REMAINING THINNING, PRUNING, AND SLASH TREATMENT.  This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area.  Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment.  Target fuel loading objective is 10-15 tons per acre.  Slash treatment in helicopter units will be accomplished by hand piling, and the ground based units will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash.   

This project requires removal of approximately 5,871 ccf of saw timber and approximately 1,280 ccf of non-saw material (mechantable woody debris), which will be credited to the project.

The resultant contract will be a firm-fixed price task order with requirements for timber removal.  

If you have questions about this project please contact Marianne Klingler Contract Specialist at (541) 523-1210.

<DESC>RECOVERY
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure Eighty (80) brand name Applied Biosystems Taqman Human microRNA Arrays A &amp; B. <br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)  using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide eighty Applied Biosystems Taqman MicroRNA Arrays.</p>
<p>Unique features of the Applied Biosystems TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays include:</p>
<p>1.)	Reaction vessel uses microfluidic technology in a 384-well plate format.<br />2.)	The reaction vessel has 8 sample loading ports and must use centrifugation to distribute the samples into each of the 48 wells serviced by each port.<br />3.)	The reaction vessel is compatible with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System (a real-time PCR instrument).  NCI already has this system in the lab, so there is no need to purchase additional equipment. <br />4.)	The reaction vessel is pre-loaded with pre-designed 5'-nuclease assays using TaqMan&reg; probes. <br />a. 	The assay contains the necessary primers and probes to perform both reverse transcription of the 	targeted miRNA, and real time PCR detection of that miRNA transcript only. <br />b.  	The assay id specific for the mature form of the miRNA transcript.<br />c.	The real time PCR detection method includes TaqMan&reg; probes (5' nuclease chemistry) with MGB 	quenching the 3' end of the probe.<br />d.	The TaqMan&reg; probe is cleaved when the probe hybridizes to the target.<br />e.	The assay has a minimum dynamic range of 6 logs.<br />5.)	The vendor shall supply all the necessary consumables to perform real-time quantitative PCR, including PCR reagents designed for use with the fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay. All PCR reagents contain a passive internal reference dye to minimize well-to-well variability.<br />6.)	The vendor shall provide comprehensive assay design and development guidelines for real-time quantitative PCR.<br />7.)	The vendor shall offer Telephone Technical Support and Field Applications/Sales/Service Support to help solve chemistry and instrumentation problems encountered with real-time quantitative PCR.<br />8.)	High specificity: single base pair discrimination of mature miRNA.<br />9.)	Sensitivity: single copy of target<br />10.)	Linear Dynamic Range: 7-9 logs of linear dynamic range<br />11.)	Ease of use: Easily implementable on existing 7900HT, with only 2 steps that take approximately 3-10 minutes total hands on time average per sample when operating in high throughput (15-30 minutes per sample hands on time in low throughput)<br />12.)	Low sample input: Ability to assess single cells or low cell population (Non-biased assessment of single cells with the TaqMan Array).

SCOPE OF WORK10/06/09
Avalanche Hazard ReductionYellowstone National Park
The Contractor shall provide and be responsible for all work noted below unless specifically stated otherwise:
1.	Conduct Avalanche hazard reduction within Yellowstone National Park along specific mountain pass roadway corridors for the purpose of visitor and employee safety during the 09/10 thru 13/14 winter seasons.  The preferred method of reduction for this work is aerial delivery of explosive charges as per typical proven industry methods.  
2.	Hazard reduction operations shall begin as dictated by weather / snowfall events as determined by National Park Service (NPS) avalanche forecast personnel and continue thru spring road openings as necessary per conditions.  
3.	All aspects of the aerial delivery operations shall comply with all applicable federal regulations as pertains to the aerial delivery and the handling, storage and disposal of explosive charges and associated restricted materials.
4.	The contractor shall assume the responsibility for the operational control of each mission, specifically having final say in the go/no go decision for each mission considering weather, personnel, type of control to be utilized, specific application of control measure and the determination of all risk management related to the aerial operations.
5.	The contractor shall be responsible for the purchase, storage and accountability for any / all explosives and associated restricted materials.  
6.	Personnel Safety shall take precedence over all other operational considerations and factored into the go / no go decision made by the contractor.
7.	The National Park Service avalanche forecasters shall make available via pre-operational briefing, all pertinent field information such as: current conditions, specific zones of concern where control operations are desired, relevant weather considerations, suggestions on potential explosive charge size(s) and specific placement(s) to be considered based on past operational experience for the highest probability of success.  The contractor shall make the final determination as to the location and method / size of the specific reduction operation.
8.	Yellowstone National Park shall offer radio communications advisory service via the NPS Fire Dispatch Center to the contractor during operational activities.  This service shall be available and limited to areas where viable FM communications capabilities presently exist within the park.  This service is offered for enhanced public safety purposes.  
9.	Compatible radio communications must be available from the contractor in order to communicate with on the ground NPS avalanche forecasters.
10.	The NPS reserves the right to terminate a reduction operation at any time.
11.	The contractor shall provide an operations implementation plan prior to the beginning of the contract and provide any changes to that plan prior to implementation.  That plan should include details of how they intend to conduct the operations, who will be involved, copies of specialized certifications such as Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) license for storage and handling of explosives materials, specialized equipment to be used, means of transportation, primary contacts with phone numbers, etc.
12.	Missions may occur anytime after 11/15/09 through early April 2014 and the order for such will be initiated by NPS avalanche forecasters. The NPS estimates an average of 5 missions may be ordered each winter; however, the contract only guarantees that the contractor will be compensated for a minimum of one mission. The actual total number of missions is predicated on avalanche hazard reduction needs as assessed by NPS avalanche forecasters.  Mission numbers vary from year to year and could exceed 5 missions or be less than 5 given specific snowfall and flying weather with the most unpredictable variable being weather.  
13.	The contractor shall not be held liable for uncontrollable circumstances that would otherwise compromise their availability such as mechanical / maintenance issues for vital equipment, mission critical staff issues (ie. illness, etc..) , or other unanticipated issues beyond the contractor's control.  
14.	The Government and the contractor recognize that some missions may be cancelled or incomplete. The price for cancelled or incomplete missions shall be negotiated prior to the beginning of the contract. This clause recognizes that weather is probably the single most common factor to cancelled or incomplete missions and is intended to remove any unnecessary implied pressure which might compromise safety.  This clause also serves to recognize the availability of the contractor who might otherwise have declined other work to prepare for and execute the mission request.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for concentrated solar power plant based on the technology of eSolar, Inc.</p>
<p>The Grantee, Millennium Energy Industries, also known as International for Energy Technology Industries, is a Jordan based international solar energy solutions company operating in the Middle East North Africa region.</p>
<p>The objective of the Study is to examine the feasibility of a Concentrated Solar Power project based on power plant technology supplied by eSolar, Inc. It is anticipated that the implementation of engineering, procurement and construction will be done in a phased approach, including initially a 5 MW demonstration project, followed by a separate and independent 46 MW project or multiple projects, collectively known as "the Ma'an Project."</p>
<p>The Study will include eSolar technology due diligence, techno-economic assessments, engineering, procurement and construction cost estimates, permitting assistance and project implementation planning. The Grantee has already chosen a site in the Ma'an Industrial Estate for the planned facility but requires further guidance on site assessment.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $738,492 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA. Any and all questions regarding this announcement should be sent to John Kusnierek at the above address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by November 19, 2009 at the above address. Proposals may be submitted electronically to Hishamm@millenniumenergy.co.uk. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED UNDER THIS SOURCES SOUGHTANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER.

These individual systems may be commercial, modified commercial or MIL-SPEC systems. They must all, however, function as an integrated indivisible whole. The line between where one system ends and the next system begins is not discernable since it is not the functioning of the individual systems that governs but rather the overall end state capability of providing worldwide, tri-service, multinational satellite communications. Each system is interdependent since the absence of one system may impact the ability to provide overall satellite communications given the deployment scenario and the individual mission that is to be accomplished at any given time. This overarching communications capability is provided by a continuum of systems and services. It is the synergy of the individual systems not the stand alone system itself that satisfies the mission.  <BR><BR><BR>Required Capabilities:<BR><BR>A copy of the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Requirement List (CDRLs), Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254), and CTS Questionnaire pertaining to this requirement may be accessed at Attachment 001, 002, 0003 and 004 to this Sources Sought Announcement.

This SS/RFI is intended to provide the Air Force with an understanding of the technology and resources available within industry to support this effort, with a scope of 436 Air Education and Training Command (AETC), 15 Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and 10 US Navy T-38C aircraft, along with related ground support equipment. Sustaining engineering, but not CLS, also extends to 37 T-38C Aircrew Training Devices (ATD), including the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), the Unit Training Device (UTD) and the Weapon System Trainer (WST). The ATD sustaining engineering support shall encompass software changes and/or upgrades (and any coinciding hardware changes/upgrades, as applicable). The complete T-38C avionics system consists of approximately 60 Non-Developmental Items (NDI) and commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRU) (note: the equipment that comprises the T-38C Avionics Suite may not be in the DoD supply system). The contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), performance based contract consisting of a base year (FY11) with four additional years of FFP options, encompassing the planned period between the fourth quarter of FY10 through FY15. The contract shall provide for: <br />a) An avionics block upgrade process that keeps the T-38C aircraft airworthy and current by providing up-to-date capabilities (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) approach) <br />b) Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations (avionics support) consistent with the local operational schedule at each of AETC's T-38C Main Operating Bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB, with the ability to support AFMC operations at Edwards AFB, Holloman AFB, and Navy operations at Patuxent River Naval Air Station (aka NAS Pax River))<br />c) Spare parts and equipment which will guarantee the continued maintenance and flying operations support of the LRUs in the currently approved system configuration; contractor repair of removed components at the contractor's or Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) facilities and returned to COMBS, based on a fixed price for the combined annual number of hours flown by AETC, AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 96,000 hours total annually) <br />d) Technical order recommendations to an engineering organization <br />e) Contractor repair of damaged LRUs and maintenance of an effective damaged equipment program<br />f) Field Service Representatives (FSR) at each of the AETC MOBs, Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS, who will: <br />(1) Act as a liaison between the customer and home office<br />(2) Assist the on-site customer in detecting technical deficiencies<br />(3) Investigate and provide feedback to the customer on avionics issues and advise on solutions towards difficult or unusual problems<br />(4) Coordinate with COMBS to obtain parts<br />(5) Provide technical interface for engineering support<br />(6) Provide training for new personnel, as required<br />(7) Provide on-site customer support for the data collection system described in section 1(h)<br />g) Engineering processes to resolve any issues involving software support and material deficiency reporting for LRUs and ATDs<br />h) A system that collects, manages, analyzes and archives Maintenance Fault Lists (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL), and engine, flight loads and Air Combat Maneuvering Information (ACMI) data for each flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis and promotes product improvement<br />i) An effective means to manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources<br />j) Engineering and program management expertise that ensures efficient and effective management of the activities and supplies necessary to meet program requirements<br />k) Maintenance of engineering and technical data<br />l) Tracking and reporting key avionics support performance to include system level MTBF, parts issue rates and avionics mission success rate<br />m) Over and Above (O &amp; A) activities necessary for correction of problems found during aircraft maintenance operations <br />n) Materials for O &amp; A corrections <br />o) Resolution of issues involving software support, engineering services, hardware/aircraft modifications, and material deficiency reporting in coordination with government organizations having Systems Engineering (SE) responsibility<br />2. Sustaining engineering includes SE and program management services to keep the avionics system for the T-38C training systems current/airworthy (e.g., requirements definition/generation, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) and proposal preparation, as well as test and implementation of those changes). The contractor shall provide configuration management/control for the avionics components to include requirements and certification traceability, specification trees, supplier management and diminishing resources management. The contractor will record, monitor, and analyze equipment failures and provide recommendations to maintain or improve aircraft readiness levels. The contractor shall provide both technical and programmatic risk management. The technical services provided shall also include on-demand accident investigation analysis and support. The application of engineering and programmatic expertise includes planning for major and minor modifications to the avionics system for product improvements, or developing a solution in response to a discontinuance of commercial items (e.g. memory cards). As part of the T-38C community, the contractor must be able to react quickly and positively to real-world changes and have sufficient intellectual depth to bring in specific expertise from outside the program as required. A block upgrade process is used to keep the aircraft/ATDs airworthy/current by providing up-to-date capabilities (e.g., GPS approach). The block upgrade process enables a SE approach to systematically upgrade the aircraft and ATDs to keep them viable in a changing world. See Attachment 3 for additional details.<br />3. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed or damaged LRUs, providing spares during the repair process, performing FSR tasks, and the effective operation of each AETC MOB's COMBS. The T-38C sustainment approach will include performance based logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at both the avionics system level (system level avionics MTBF of 50 hours) and LRU level. Guaranteed part availability and issue rates at the COMBS are expected. In order to comply with the COMBS turnaround times, the contractor must ensure that sufficient spares are available or that other arrangements are in place to ensure these times are met. The government will consider other metrics and the contractor's suggestions for metrics. A list of LRU part numbers and suppliers will be supplied at a later date. The contractor must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign OEM or authorized repair facilities. See Attachment 2 for more COMBS details.<br />4. Interested parties must submit two copies in writing to include the following information: (via U.S. mail or e-mail to brittany.hines@wpafb.af.mil) the company/institution and any teaming or joint venture partners; address; point of contact; telephone number; e-mail address; company status (large, small business, 8a, etc) based on a NAIC CODE: 336413 and your Cage Code. A statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership) plus answers to the attached questions/comments in the order indicated in Attachment 1. All respondents must be registered in Central Contractor Regulation to respond to the resultant Request for Proposal. All responses are due NLT 1400 EST 08 May 2009. All responses from feasible sources will be fully reviewed, however receipt of responses will not be acknowledged.

<SUBJECT>Indexing of Journal Articles for MEDLINE

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p>National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>The Index Section of the National Library of Medicine is responsible for the indexing of life sciences journals for MEDLINE. Information pertaining to MEDLINE is available at the NLM Web site: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html.</p>
<p>The indexing policies and procedures used at NLM are detailed in the NLM Indexing Manual, which is supplemented by technical memoranda and other indexing aids. The major effort required by indexing is the analysis of journal articles for subject matter and the application of appropriate subject headings, drawn from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the NLM controlled vocabulary. Access to MeSH is available via the NLM MeSH Browser at: www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html. See also the NLM fact sheet on MeSH at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/mesh.html.<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to obtain indexing of approximately 640,000 biomedical journal articles for MEDLINE and creating approximately 78,000 gene links per year. Indexing is also sought for up to 8,200 chemical queries per year by chemical specialists, and for up to 1,500 records per year for the HSRProj database. These quantities are for the base year of a contract that is expected to have multiple annual options with the rate of growth being approximately 4% for journal articles and a proportional number of gene links. The duration of this contract will consist of a one-year base period, followed by one Option Year and three Award Terms for a total of five years.</p>
<p>The MEDLINE indexing work in this contract will be performed using the NLM current online Web-based indexing system, the Data Citation Creation and Maintenance System (hereto referred to as DCMS). During the course of this contract, it is possible that this system will be either modified, or replaced with a more efficient production system. Access to the DCMS is restricted to authorized users. For further information on DCMS see the NLM fact sheet http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/online_indexing_system.html.</p>
<p>The nature of scientific journal publishing is in a state of change; journals traditionally published in print format are being published online on the Internet. Many of the journals currently indexed for MEDLINE are published exclusively on the Internet, with no print counterpart. An increasing number of journals are anticipated to be published solely online during the life of this contract, and when print and online versions both exist, the online version will be used for MEDLINE indexing whenever possible. It is expected that only a small proportion of print journals will be used for MEDLINE indexing. The fact that a journal is published online rather than in print will not affect the assignment, configuration of subject headings, check tags, and such that an indexer must apply to a journal article when performing the indexing operation.</p>
<p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was established at NLM in 1988. NCBI serves as a national resource for molecular biology information by creating public databases, conducting research in computational biology, developing software tools for analyzing genome data, and disseminating biomedical information - all for the better understanding of molecular processes affecting human health and disease (see<br />http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/ncbi.html). In 2001, MEDLINE indexers began to perform gene indexing using LocusLink, an NCBI database and single query interface to curate sequence and descriptive information about genetic loci. LocusLink presented information on official nomenclature, aliases, sequence accessions, phenotypes, EC numbers, MIM numbers, UniGene clusters, homology, map locations, and related web sites. Sequence accessions include a subset of GenBank accessions for a locus, as well as a new type, the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq). In 2004, this database system was phased into Entrez Gene, which represented an upgrade in functionality and searchability.</p>
<p>Gene indexing consists of creating an annotated link between a record in Entrez Gene and a MEDLINE citation. As MEDLINE indexers perform subject analysis and indexing of a journal article, and following NLM guidelines, they must recognize that an article requires gene indexing because the main point is basic genetic, chemical, or functional information about a gene or protein. The indexer must then identify the appropriate record in Entrez Gene by searching for the organism and the gene or protein, and then create a link between the Entrez Gene record and the MEDLINE citation. The indexer must also create a short statement (usually a sentence fragment, often extracted directly from the abstract or article text) that describes the new information about the gene or protein that is reported in the article. DCMS is programmed to interact with Entrez Gene so that gene indexing may be performed as efficiently and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this contract, as needed to perform the work.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement must identify the responder's small business type and size.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 3:00pm eastern standard time on Thursday October 15, 2009 Uyen Phuong at phuongu@mail.nih.gov.</p>

The purpose of this announcement is to identify sources that have past performance, relevant corporate experience and the capability and capacity to provide all management, labor, material, tools, facilities, equipment and supervision for the Loggerhead Shrike Captive Breeding Program on San Clemente Island, CA.
The San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi) is an island endemic that was close to extinction prior to the initiation of the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program.  The current success of the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program is due in large part to efforts to augment the wild shrike population with the release of captive bred, and in some instances - captive reared, shrikes.  This Contract continues the implementation of an ongoing program for the captive breeding, and where appropriate, rearing of the San Clemente loggerhead shrike.
The contractor shall provide all management, labor, travel, transportation, meals, materials and equipment for the purposes of this work effort except for items specified as Government Furnished Property, Materials and Services. The basic requirement of this contract would be to provide for captive breeding, maintenance, and care of the San Clemente Island Loggerhead Shrike population, providing the required number of shrikes for single adult release, juvenile release and bonded pair/family release based on recommendations by the Shrike Working Group and negotiated with the Government Representative and Station Point of Contact.  The contractor would also provide supplemental food (crickets, mealworms, and mice) sufficient to enhance the daily diet of a pre-specified number of released shrikes; provide for salvage, artificial incubation and hand rearing of wild eggs/chick from nests; provide demographic and genetic management of the captive flock; provide veterinary care to captive and wild shrikes; provide pathology services; provide for sexing of captive and wild shrikes; provide for genetic analyses of shrike feathers; and as part of the base year only - provide for an update of the 2005 MASTER PLAN.
A firm fixed price service contract will be required. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of $7.0M. All small businesses are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office, Littoraland Mine Warfare (PEO LMW), MaritimeSurveillance Systems (MSS), ProgramManager Ships 485 (PMS 485) requirescontinuous updates of technology andnew concepts to support its mission toprovide undersea surveillance systemsto the Fleet.  Systems are comprised offixed systems, mobile systems such asSurveillance Towed Array SensorSystem (SURTASS), and distributedsensing systems.To facilitate efficient informationexchange, PMS 485 has established aprogram to periodically reviewtechnologies and ideas from industry,government labs, universities, andknowledgeable individuals duringscheduled 2-day periods on an annualbasis.  PMS 485 has establishedTechnical Tracks that are aligned to thekey segments of its system functionalarchitecture.  The Tracks and generalareas of interest in each are:Sensors:  For towed arrays: netsnagging mitigation, array shapemeasurement/modeling, low frequencyactive acoustic source technology, newactive, passive, bi-static, multi-static,acoustic, non-acoustic, fixed, towed,linear, vertical, all fiber or hybrids,vector, or volumetric sensors to detectundersea targets.  Technologies toprevent passive array from sinkingduring slow speed or vessel stopped(DIW) conditions.Ocean Operations:  Methods andapparatus for deployment and /ormaintenance of sensors of varioustypes from various undersea or surfaceplatforms.  For a distributed sensingsystem application, this includesconcepts for autonomous deploymentand burial of linear arrays.Undersea networks and telemetry:Methods and enabling components,protocols, software, power supplies,gateways, branching units, fiber oracoustic, laser, light emitting diodecommunications to facilitate underseacommunication sensor/data networks.For a distributed sensing systemapplication, this includes compactreeling pop-up buoy type systems forcontact report exfiltration as well asmeasuring ocean temperature anddepth.Processing: Signal Conditioning:Methods and enabling components toprepare raw sensor data fortransmission, filtering, beam-forming,compression, comparison, fusion,cueing of other sensors, includingprogramming and computing advancesto reduce coding time.Sensor Data Processing:  Methods andenabling components to processprepared sensor data for display andvisualization, including super-computing applied to acoustic domaindata, parallel processing, pipelining,multi-threading, striping, virtualization,Input / Output (IO) maximization,automation algorithms, bell-ringers.For a distributed sensing systemapplication, this includes in-arrayhardware and software to conductautonomous classification of targets assubmarine / surface (e.g., usingmatched field processing).Storage, Retrieval and ContentManagement:  New approaches to lowcost, low latency, low energyconsumption, storing, retrieving,tagging, posting, sharing, managing,and archiving acoustic, contact, trackand amplifying information supportingnetworked nodes in a classified serviceoriented architecture (SOA) for local orweb enabled access.Display and Visualization:  Methodsand components for displaying andvisualizing data that will enhance theoperators ability to discern contactinformation from the presentedacoustic and/or fused data, operatorworkload reduction.Communications/Data Exfiltration:Methods and enabling technology toexfiltrate various data types from thesensing/processing node to othercritical elements either within a node orexternally to a remote node, includingcompression and error correctioncoding, advanced Low Probability ofIntercept / Low Probability of Detection(LPI/LPD) approaches and methods forbridging the acoustic to RadioFrequency (RF) transmission path.Command and Control:  Tacticaldecision aids, data fusion,environmental prediction, sensorplanning, Undersea Warfare - DecisionSupport System (USW-DSS) segmentsof interest to MSS, Command andControl (C2) of underwater unmannedvehicle (UUV) remote operations.Schedule and Location:The next scheduled session is plannedfor 1330-1730, November 9 and 0800-1730, November 10 in San Diego, CA.Submission Content/Selection:Interested parties shall submit a onepage UNCLASSIFIED White Paper onthe topic desired to be briefed NLT1600, 15 October, 2009 on the Spaceand Naval Warfare Commands(SPAWAR) E-commerce site; https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/ underSPAWAR Headquarters, Market Surveysunder Maritime Surveillance Systems(PMS 485) Technology Review.Papers should include: Name ofbusiness entity/individual, presenter,classification, desired functionalsegment, contact information and ashort explanation of the technology orconcept and proposed fit.  The PMS485 Technical Director will select WhitePapers for presentation based onwhether (1) they are within the missionof PMS 485 described in the synopsisabove, (2) they are within the scope ofthe Technical Tracks described in thesynopsis above, and (3) a TechnicalReadiness Level (TRL) of 7 could beachieved in the next 3 year period.  Incases of conflict or insufficient tracktime slots, the White Papers selectedfor presentation will be accepted in theorder received.Each presenter will be allocated 45minutes to include a question andanswer period.  Initially, a companymay present in no more than 2 tracksessions.  Complete details of thepresentation process will be providedwith the notification that a White Paperhas been selected for presentation.Note that presentations selected maybe made up to the SECRET GeneralService (GENSER) level.Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):The Government anticipates that SMEsfor each area will participate in theTechnology Review.  Some SMEs maybe Systems Engineering and TechnicalAssistance (SETA) Contractors orUniversity Affiliated Research Centers(UARC) personnel.  The identity of theSMEs will be made known to allscheduled presenters prior to thescheduled session and, if desired, Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs) shouldbe executed between the non-Government parties prior to thebriefing.Notification:All persons submitting White Paperswill be notified whether they areselected participants in the TechnologyReview NLT 23 October, 2009.Feedback:PMS 485 will solicit participant feedbackafter the Maritime Surveillance SystemsTechnology Review to improve theprocess as applicable.

<DESC>Request for Information<BR>                         Army Enterprise Scheduling System (ESS)<BR><BR>1.0  Description<BR>The Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could meet the requirement to deliver an Enterprise-wide scheduling, operational modeling and decision support tool to assist TRADOC Headquarters and subordinate centers and schools across 15 installations with establishing a multi-echelon common operating picture.  Core functionality is characterized into three primary functions:<BR><BR>(1)  Operational scheduling of resources and facilities to meet unit and course requirements as established by TRADOC approved programs of instruction, non-TRADOC unit training guidance and validated tasking missions.  <BR><BR>(2)  Enable planners at multiple levels from the individual resource manager to HQ, TRADOC to effectively understand planned events and programmed activities in a manner that highlights shortfalls in capabilities and required resourcing needs.  The system must enable authorized users to conduct what-if analysis, creating scenarios with varying resource and facility availability, operational requirements and infrastructure.   <BR><BR>(3)  Must support the documentation of actual use by enabling executing units, as part of their after actions review process, to input durations and actual resources used to conduct training.  <BR> <BR>Army Enterprise Scheduling System (ESS) will automate the three phases of scheduling and planning within Army Schools:  Long Range Planning, Mid Range Planning, and Near Range Scheduling.  Essential to this complex undertaking is the systems ability to maintain data currency and provide a uniform common operating picture across the command.  To do this the system must interface with current Army applications to establish training requirements and maintain system of record documentation for funding allocation.  <BR><BR>This ESS must allow schedulers, planners and leaders at all levels to match current and programmed resource capacities against future training requirements with an end state of identifying shortfalls and chokepoints impacting both the schools and  installations and their ability to support the TRADOC mission.  These shortfalls and chokepoints can then be addressed and courses of action can be developed that include but are not limited to rescheduling, reduction of course loads, facility & range upgrade or construction, and reallocation of resources, potentially inter-school or center as needed to support the mission.<BR><BR>The tool is envisioned as a tool to be used that will track courses/phases, separate DL phase, module(s), separate DL module(s), courseware, students, and resources to ensure availability when required.<BR>The ESS must be able to be accessed via a web connection using a commercial browser and operate in an unclassified mode via Army Knowledge Online authentication and compliant with  the following standards: Communications standards: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN); Platform compliance standards: Windows, Uniplexed Information and Computing System (Unix); and, Quality and safety standards: Universal Language (UL), Information Systems Office (ISO), Capability Maturity Model (CMM).  The ESS will be hosted at a centralized location and will be dependent upon the infrastructure of that location for its successful integration and use. The ESS will allow for the transfer of data from/to TDC, RITM, ATTRS, RFMSS, and other systems identified as essential during ESS development to the scheduling software. <BR><BR>1.1  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  <BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense.

If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<BR><BR>2.0  Background.<BR>There are presently 5-6 different GOTs, COTs and Proprietary scheduling systems operating within TRADOC today.  The intent of this effort is to identify a common solution set that will function to provide Enterprise-wide scheduling, operational modeling and a decision support tool that would assist TRADOC Headquarters and subordinate centers and schools across 15 installations with establishing a multi-echelon common operating picture.  <BR>2.1  Planned Delivery Period:  To be determined.  TRADOC would like to expedite this effort to the greatest extent possible.<BR>3.0  Requested Information. <BR>TRADOC is interested in gathering information from Industry on what systems are currently is existence with the capabilities identified above in the Description of this requirement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 

The purpose of this announcement is to publish the Attendance List and Questions and Answers for the 12-14 Aug. 2009, and the Attendance List for the 23-25 Sep. 2009 Industry Days relating to the forthcoming solicitation for the Decision Support System (DSS). Questions and Answers for the 23-25 Sep. 2009. Industry day will be provided in the Final Offerors Library which will be available with the Final Request for Proposal. The Question and Answer package contains controlled unclassified information and is therefore labeled For Official Use Only (FOUO).  The contents of the DSS Question and Answer package are NOT approved for public release.

The Industry Day briefing packages will be made available to interested companies that did not attend the Industry Days. To request a copy of the package, attach the completed request form to an e-mail titled DSS Briefing Request and send to DSS@mda.mil. The briefing package will be electronically sent to the provided e-mail address. The DSS Industry Day event briefing packages contains controlled unclassified information and are therefore labeled For Official Use Only (FOUO).  The contents of the DSS Industry Day briefing packages are NOT approved for public release.



OCI CONSIDERATIONS:

The acquisition of the Decision Support System services under the forthcoming solicitation may create actual or potential conflicts of interest (OCIs) for Offerors and their prospective subcontractors or other team members.  In assessing and addressing conflicts of interest, MDA will follow the guidance in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Offerors will be responsible for ensuring that they and their proposed subcontractors or other team members are not restricted from participating in the forthcoming Request for Proposal due to an OCI related to any MDA-funded contract or subcontract; Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) development, fielding and sustainment related contracts or subcontracts; or other significant, non-BMDS related business relationships with firms doing business with or in support of the MDA. 
It is MDAs policy that, consistent with GAO and court decisions, impaired objectivity (bias-type) OCIs cannot be adequately mitigated through firewalls and/or separate corporate divisions.  An impaired objectivity OCI is not mitigated if a contractor performs BMDS development, fielding or sustainment efforts and a firewalled affiliate and/or separate organizational component provides separate Decision Support System services. 
For purposes of this competition, therefore, MDA does not intend to award any contracts to any contractors, subcontractors, or other team members who also participate in a significant manner in the development, fielding or sustainment of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Also, MDA does not intend to grant OCI waivers of bias-type (i.e. biased ground rules and impaired objectivity) as part of this procurement process when it relates to significant participants in BMDS development, fielding, or sustainment.

The solicitation will provide further information relating to impaired objectivity and other OCIs and how to have them addressed and preliminarily resolved prior to offer submission. Additionally, the solicitation will include a clause(s) in Section H that will establish restrictions and obligations to avoid, neutralize or mitigate OCIs.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is a notice of intent of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), for software maintenance for Informatica's Power Center software.  Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.  Informatica's Power Center is available on SEWP; however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  AITC has an existing Informatica Power Center licensing agreement through NGIT for all Informatica Power Center products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Please reply no later than October 13, 2009 to Sylvia Thomas at Sylvia.Thomas2@va.gov.

4.7 Security Requirements

4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract. Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval. If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer. The Contractor's total loss of access approval for grand jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

4.7.1.2 The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract. This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants. No employee may be used on grand jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

4.7.1.3 Should grand jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17. In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies. 

4.7.1.4 In the event the USAOs is unable to obtain security approval to grand jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for grand jury court reporters. 

4.7.1.5 The Contractor agrees to ensure any subcontractor proposed for the furnishing of supplies and services which will involve access to grand jury information in the Contractor's custody has the appropriate employment security approval in effect prior to being afforded access to grand jury information.

4.7.2 Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder. The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


 Policy development or implementation

 Higher-level management assignment

 Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

 Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

 IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

 Assistance to policy development and implementation,

 Mid-level management assignments,

 Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

 Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

 IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2. As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category. In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.

The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Low Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of Investigation Name and Fingerprint check. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below. The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

Title and Number of Form No. of Copies

FD-258 Fingerprint Card 2
SF 85P - Questionnaire For 2
Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on: 1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness. Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees. If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required. The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody. The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement. The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

4.7.4 Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person. The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area. When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows: 
o Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation.

(End of Clause)
SECTION D. ATTACHMENTS

D.1 Contractor Residency Requirement Information

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

 Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

 Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

 Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

 Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

 Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

 Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

 With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

 Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

 Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

 Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

 Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractors responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance Emergency Acquisitions, May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
I Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
I If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT. THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil
It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
SECTION B: ******************************************************************************
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial ItemsNOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 None;
SECTION C: ******************************************************************************FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE    (ii)  PRICE
(b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  
(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Innova instrument shall be adequately isolated from vibration, heat sources and sinks, and other detrimental environmental factors per LumaSense recommendations.The design of this function shall include any hardware necessary to isolate sample and calibration paths and utilize an overflow configuration and/or other means of preventing over pressurization of the Innova analyzer when introducing compressed gases.The LumaSense? Innova photoacoustic analyzer shall be provided by EPA, configured as follows:Model 3433 with the most current firmware; asynchronous operationFilters configured as follows: 
FilterLocation	Filter Number	Compound 	Compound NameA	UA0976	NH3	Ammonia B	UA0974	C2H5OH	EthanolC	UA0985	N2O	Nitrous OxideD	UA0983	CO2	Carbon DioxideE	UA0984	CO	Carbon MonoxideW	SBO527	H2O	Water
The physical integration of the Innova analyzer in the MEXA system shall also include a quick disconnect on the front panel of the analyzer rack that allows for introduction of compressed calibration gases for the purpose of regularly conducting a multi-compound analyzer calibration utilizing the method published by LumaSense.  The construction of this external port shall include all hardware and associated controls necessary to select and isolate this flow path.  This flow path shall also be constructed in a manner which prevents over pressurization of the analyzer when introducing compressed gases.  Selection of this flow path shall be a stand-alone function available when the MEXA system is otherwise idle. The MEXA system shall include a method that allows for external computer-based interaction with the Innova instrument when off-line for instrument calibration and other off-line Innova functions.  At a minimum this requirement may be satisfied by providing an RS-232 switch along with easily accessible RS-232 connection point for an external EPA computer.The minimum sample integration time shall be 10 seconds for ethanol and 5 seconds for other compounds.  Instrument operation will normally utilize the Innova cross-compensation feature.Innova tube flush and chamber flush times shall be set per manufacturer?s recommendation, based on sample system configuration, in order to allow adequate analyzer stabilization time.MEXA system design and configuration shall allow for Innova analysis of an external bag, and associated transmission of sample concentrations Horiba Instruments, Inc is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirement(s) because of the proprietary Horiba Mexa-7000 LAN host communication protocol utilized by existing EPA test site-specific equipment that is not being replaced.However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>Amendment #1 is here by issued to extend the close date to October 13th, 2009 at 2:00 PM EST. This amendment is also to provide clarity on the following 2 each questions:
<p>Question 1; Reference page 4 of the Statement of Work: Can you please clarify fees as they might pertain to: a) Work performed at contractor site for preparations prior to arriving at Front Royal, such as course preparation time?, and, b) Work performed at locations other than Front Royal? <br />Discussion: The question is asked because we don't fully understand how one proposed rate will cover the various scenarios described such as preparation work on the behalf of the contractors prior to arriving at Front Royal which might be contractor site, performance at Front Royal, and performance at some sites other than Front Royal. We believe if we load per diem and travel averages into a single rate we'll be overcharging for contractor site work performed before departing to Front Royal or other locations and we could be under-charging when work is performed at a greater distance in a higher cost area, such as travel to Los Angeles for work there. Please clarify.</p>
<p>There is no work to be performed at the contractor site before arriving prior to Front Royal.</p>
<p>Contractor is responsible for his/her travel expenses to Front Royal, VA Canine Training Center.</p>
<p>Travel is subject to Standardized Government Travel Regulations.</p>
<p>If contractor is requested to travel to an off site canine training activities other than Front Royal, VA - the contractor then may submit an invoice for reimbursement for travel expenses /payment.</p>
<p><br />Question 2; Reference pp 5-6 of the SOW, "Background Investigation Requirements," the "personnel suitability and security package" required to initiate a background investigation: In addition to listing the eight aspects for which the Contractor must screen employees prior to submission to ATF's Personnel Security Branch, it is stipulated that "the Contractor is required to review each potential contractor employee's personnel suitability and security package to ensure the forms are fully complete, signed, and dated." Does ATF have or recommend specific forms to be used in the screening process and preparation of the personnel suitability and security package?</p>
<p><br />Forms are provided in the pink security package that is given to the COTR which in turn is handed out to the awarded contractor. Candidate must pass the background security check.</p>

However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. In order to select the winning proposal, EOUSA will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability with the marginal difference in price.

4.7 Security Requirements

4.7.1 Personnel Security

4.7.1.1 The USAO will process background security investigations for grand jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract. Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to grand jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized Department of Justice personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval. If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to grand jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer. The Contractor's total loss of access approval for grand jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

4.7.1.2 The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract. This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants. No employee may be used on grand jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

4.7.1.3 Should grand jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17. In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies. 

4.7.1.4 In the event the USAOs is unable to obtain security approval to grand jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for grand jury court reporters. 

4.7.1.5 The Contractor agrees to ensure any subcontractor proposed for the furnishing of supplies and services which will involve access to grand jury information in the Contractor's custody has the appropriate employment security approval in effect prior to being afforded access to grand jury information.

4.7.2 Required Security Investigation

4.7.2.1 The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder. The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


 Policy development or implementation

 Higher-level management assignment

 Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

 Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

 IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

 Assistance to policy development and implementation,

 Mid-level management assignments,

 Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

 Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

 IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2. As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category. In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.

The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Low Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of Investigation Name and Fingerprint check. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check.

4.7.2.5 The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below. The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.

Title and Number of Form No. of Copies

FD-258 Fingerprint Card 2
SF 85P - Questionnaire For 2
Public Trust Positions

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on: 1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(c) Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness. Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees. If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required. The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody. The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement. The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

4.7.4 Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person. The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area. When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows: 
o Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation. Central station burglar alarm systems classified by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. or other systems with built-in auxiliary power for fail safe protection, shall satisfy this requirement. (Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches). A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized. If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3 End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4 The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5 If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5 Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2 When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 


4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval. 

4.7.6 Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Data.

a. Systems Security

SECTION D. ATTACHMENTS

D.1 Contractor Residency Requirement Information

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

 Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

 Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

 Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

 Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

 Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

 Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

 With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

 Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

 Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

 Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

 Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractors responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance Emergency Acquisitions, May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

1.	On your solicitation you estimate a total average of about 54,000 pgs for the year on Grand Jury hearing, my questions is if that estimate is only of one specific court location or is that for all district hearing which are about 780 per year in which that number is also included in the solicitation? 

All district hearings.

<DESC>Vendor's Question

1.What is the closing date of this RFQ?

Closing Date is June 19, 2009 at 5:00pm EST



2.	In the section where it says the Government reserves the right to copy and distribute to anyone transcripts purchased from the Contractor, do you mean anyone within the Government or do you mean that you will provide free copies of our transcripts to opposing counsel?


No, opposing counsel will be required to order and pay at their expense.

3.	In the past, delivery due dates have been calculated in working days, not calendar days.  Are you using those as interchangeable or do you wish to count the weekends?

Working days.

4.	In an effort to keep costs down, sometimes transcripts are needed on a three-day turnaround, which is considerably less than a 24-hour turnaround.  That option is not in the contract.  Would you like us to include rates for that option as well?   

Yes, include three-day turnaround.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2.

Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.

<DESC>To Commercial Off the Shelf Vendors, System Integrators and IT Service Providers:
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation's (PBGC) is conducting market research to determine how PBGC can most efficiently implement an investment portfolio management and actuarial accounting interface (trust fund management). Integral to PBGC's IT governance practices, PBGC conducts Architecture and Investment Planning activities prior to implementing IT solutions. This investment planning analysis supports the replacement of multiple feeder systems to PBGC's general ledger, the Core Financial System (CFS). These feeder systems perform two critical activities in the management of PBGC's Trust Fund: 1) Investment Portfolio Management Accounting System (currently using PAM Securities), and 2) the compilation of Actuarial Accounting Interface(s) for financial statement reporting. <br />Data from this Request for Information (RFI) and PBGC's enterprise architecture analysis will be used for investment planning purposes. Increasingly, the PBGC is becoming more reliant on technology as the enabling agent for meeting management's need to streamline underlying financial and administrative processes. The PBGC places a high degree of importance on information technology as a financial investment, and understands the necessity to manage this investment wisely.<br />Scope of Information Request:<br />We are researching a solution to propose the optimal solution and services for replacing PBGC's trust fund management systems. We are requesting COTS Vendors, System Integrators and IT Service Providers (including Banks) to indicate the optimal solution and services for PBGC based on the information provided in attached market research request document. (KPMG, LLP is helping the PBGC with the analysis).</p>
<p>In response to this market research and information request, please provide the following:<br />o An updated version of Attachment A to this document. We request that your organization complete this spreadsheet indicating how you plan to satisfy PBGC key requirements.<br />o An updated version of Attachment B to this document outlining a 5-year cost estimate starting October 2010 to include planning, implementation, and post-go-live support.<br />o Identify current clients that utilize your firm's solutions and services, please highlight any clients that may have a similar transaction volume as the PBGC. <br />o Any additional information that you feel will assist PBGC in assessing alternatives for a solution.<br />Please advise if you will be able to provide the information requested and submit any questions to Tracy Soforenko (Soforenko.Tracy@pbgc.gov) and Roland Thomas (<a href="mailto:thomas.roland@pbgc.gov">thomas.roland@pbgc.gov</a>) by 12:00pm Noon ET on 10/8/2009.</p>
<p>Please further respond with the above requested information by 4:00 PM on 10/16/2009.</p>
<p>We appreciate your interest in supporting the future financial management technology needs of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.</p>

<DESC>Question:
Is this a CA product?

How long has the maintenance been expired?

Is the product used for a mainframe or another environment?

Was there a contract for this in the past and how long ago was that?

Answer:
It is not a CA product.  It is an IET product and the sole source
Configuration Management tool for the CA product (CA-GEN).  CA-Gen for lack
of better words is a code generator for both Mainframe, and Mid-Tier, and
because CA-Gen supports these platforms so does GuardIEn.  The renewal date was supposed to be October 1, 2009.  We have had a contract in place for this product for over 5 years.

<DESC>The purpose of this Synopsis modification is to reflect that this is an 8(a) competitive set-aside procurement and list the correct NAICS Codes.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD) has a requirement for Enforcement Support Services and Records Management for Regions 5 & 6. This requirement will provide a contractual framework for enforcement support services and records management and includes potential responsible parties searches and litigation support. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement are 518210 with a U.S. Small Business Administration defined size standard of $25M, 541620 with a U.S. Small Business Administration defined size standard of $7M and 519120 with a U.S. Small Business Administration defined size standard of $7M. This acquisition will be a competitive 8(a) (Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.805).
This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified contractors to provide Enforcement and Information Support to the EPA in five major areas: Community Relations, Enforcement, Administrative Records, Superfund Records and Documents and Special Projects. The EPA intends to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), fixed rate contract with a three-year base period and two one-year option periods to meet the EPA's Enforcement Support Service needs using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. 
Detailed information on the requirements is provided via the Performance Work Statement and its associated appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm). Solicitation PR-HQ-09-10879 will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 30, 2009, with proposals due thirty (30) days after the release.

<a href="mailto:Wilson.Jessica@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 339950      Question and Answers

Question 1.) Is it possible that we get an vector art file of the plaque, along with a PMS color for the Cyan background?           Answer 1.)   The color is close to 299 (c) but it is not an actual PMS color.  You will be required to match the sample as best as you can.  We do not have an "Art File".  All we have is the template that was provided in the RFQ.   You can use that PDF and convert it to your desired software.  Offerors are reminded that the sample plaques are provided to offerors to make there own measurements based off the actual sample provided

        Question 2.) Can you please provide that information as well as the font that is to be used for the word 'energy' and 'ENERGY STAR'?     Answer 2.)  We do not have a word template file.  However "The Energy Star" is about 1.0 inches and the font is universe condense.  The size ranges from the "e", which is about 1.5 inches tall to the "y" which is about 2.0 inches tall. Offerors are reminded that the sample plaques are provided to offerors to make there own measurements based off the actual sample provided

    Question 3.)  The dimensions listed in the RFQ do not match the dimensions on the sample plaque we received.     Answer 3.)  You are to match the dimensions on the sample plaque.

     Question 4.) We are researching the coating systems identified in the RFQ.  However, we are having issues locating the system identified with the paint suppliers.  Is there any additional information that is available on the coatings.  Do we have the option, if identified in our technical statement, to utilize our automotive finishes as long as they match from a visual perspective and have the same or better performance characteristics as the system being utilized? Also, the bronze area on the plaque appears to possibly have a color coating on it as well.  Can you confirm whether the bronze areas of the plaque have a color coating on them as well as the clear coat? 
     Answer 4.) We have already provided details in the RFQ.  I would emphasize to them that while the materials may vary, their sample plaque must look like the current plaque including the background. 

     Question 5.) The bid requirement is to give a cost per unit, which we can do, but it is also to give shipping costs for inside delivery. To calculate shipping we would need to know how many plaques will be ordered at one time for one shipment so we can calculate the weight, boxing, freight charges etc. Without knowing how many we are shipping we really can't calculate shipping costs. The request for quote indicates between 100-500 a month but that is a large range when dealing with a cast bronze plaque that is heavy.  What do you suggest? 
     Answer 5.)  EPA  can only provide a range as to how many plaques will be ordered on a monthly basis.  That order number is dependent on how many organizations are approved to receive the ENERGY STAR, which we can guesstimate but not predict 100 percent.  As a result, please calculate as best you can, either per unit or selecting a number like 300 and providing the cost for that.  Providing a cost per unit is preferable but not required.  As stated in the proposal, the quote is for inside delivery.
     Question 6.) Is there any where in the contract that addresses what happens if the price of bronze goes up during the contract period? We really can't control what we pay for raw materials and bronze is one of the metals that changes over time.
     Answer 6.)  You may choose to factor the fluctuation of raw material cost into your price to the Government.  Your quote will be evaluated based on the criteria set forth in the RFQ, and award will be based on a Best Value determination.  In addition, if proposed, the government may consider the inclusion of an Economic Price Adjustment clause (for fluctuation in raw materials costs) if it is determined to be in the best interest of the government.
     Question7.) We are not a small business; if I understand the modification currently it would now allow us to bid direct as a regular business (we are a foundry)?  Am I correct?  Also do you have the price per each individual plaque?  Thank-you in advance for your help.  We are trying to grow our business with your agency.  We currently have the plaque contract with the VA (cemetary) as a prime vendor.	     Answer 7.) This work is set-aside for small businesses only, and that therefore they are not qualified to submit a bid directly to EPA.  Also regarding the cost I cannot divulge the cost per plaque.  A FOIA request is required to get further information regarding the current contract.

     Question8.) Is the electronic version the only form of submission for the response to the RFQ?     Answer 8.) Please refer to the Submission Instruction in section V.  The electronic copy is to be sent to Jessica Wilson at wilson.jessica@epa.gov and Susan Bailey at bailey.marysusan@epa.gov and the plaques shall 		be delivered to: 		Susan Bailey (COR)		USEPA		1310 L Street, NW Room 902d		Mailcode 6202J		Washington, DC 200

<DESC>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>Market Survey Questionnaire<BR>for Bridge - Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability:  Type I<BR><BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:   <BR> <BR>1.	Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR> <BR>2.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR> <BR>3.	The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<BR> <BR>4.	Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR>            <BR>5.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR> <BR>6.	The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <BR><BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability (LAGCC) foot bridge. The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series of steps. <BR><BR>1.	The Type I LAGCC system must fully support execution of joint critical operational activities (Threshold {T}), and all critical operational activities (Objective {O}), identified in the applicable joint and system integrated architectures. The system must satisfy the technical requirements for transition to Net-Centric (T), or already Net-Centric (O), military operations to include:<BR><BR>a.	DOD Information Technology Standards and Profile Registry (DISR) mandated   Global Information Grid (GIG) Information Technology (IT) standards and profiles identified in the TV-1;  <BR><BR>b.	DISR mandated GIG Key Interface Profiles (KIPs) identified in the KIP declaration table; <BR><BR>c.	Net Centric Operations Warfare (NCOW) Resource Management (RM) Enterprise Services;  <BR><BR>d.	Information assurance requirements including availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality and nonrepudiation, issuance of an Interim Approval to Operate (IATO) (T), and Approval to Operate (ATO) (O), by the Designated Approval Authority (DAA); and, <BR>  <BR>e.	Operationally effective information exchanges; and mission critical performance and information assurance attributes; data correctness; data availability; and, consistent data processing specified in the applicable joint and system integrated architecture views.<BR><BR>2.	The Type I LAGCC shall have a capacity of 5 Soldiers (T), 6 Soldiers (O), within the 95th percentile with full mission equipment. The requirement is based on a fire team crossing the foot bridge at a time and potential egress with a casualty while at its maximum extension.<BR><BR>3.	There shall be no mission failure due to a single point failure from small arms fire.<BR><BR>4.	The Type I LAGCC shall be able to cross gaps in scalable increments to a total length of 30m (T), 50m (O).<BR><BR>5.	The Type I LAGCC treadway shall be a minimum of 16 (T), 25 (O). <BR><BR>6.	The Type I LAGCC shall also be transportable by highway, ocean, rail, and air assets.  Movement to the theater shall be accomplished primarily by means of airlift utilizing a C-130 transporter aircraft. The Type I LAGCC shall also be transportable by a CH-47 in the stored or employed configuration (T), CH-60 (O).  The CH-47/CH-60 requirement is based on the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) ability to move rapidly about the battlefield as C-130 transport can be restrictive. Once in the theater of operation the primary mode of transportation will be on a wheeled platform, trailer mounted or mounted on top of a host vehicle. The Type I bridge will likely be transported by an IBCT vehicle to the dismount location and hand carried from there to the point of employment.<BR><BR>7.	The Type I LAGCC shall be compliant, at minimum, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) STANAG 2010/2021 and The Tri-lateral Codes for Military Bridging and Gap Crossing Equipment (TDTC).<BR><BR>8.	The Type I LAGCC shall be capable of operating in all types of weather (rain, snow, salt spray, fog, ice, dust, sand, turbulence and high humidity) and hot and basic climatic zones (-25F to 125F) with wind speeds up to 50 knots without special kits while maintaining full mission capability (T). Shall have cold weather kits allowing operation down to -50F (O).<BR><BR>9.	The Type I LAGCC shall be capable of fording at a normal depth of 48 inches without an affixed deep water fording kit.  All external optics and electronic components shall be watertight / proof to preclude damage during shallow water fording operations (T).<BR><BR>10.	The Type I LAGCC shall be capable of launching within 30 minutes (T), 15 minutes (O), with a crew of 2-8 soldiers.<BR><BR>11.	The Type I LAGCC must have a means of determining remaining service life and safety/structural deficiencies, which does not require an external power source (T).<BR><BR>12.	The Type I LAGCC shall be able to perform its mission while in an electromagnetic environment consistent with requirements set for ground based systems and other vehicle in the Joint Force.  This includes voice, data, and camera video.  Vulnerabilities in a hostile electromagnetic environment have been documented and/or mitigated (DOT&E E3/ Spectrum Management (SM) Assessment Guide).  Regardless, the user must be provided and formally accept any E3 risks associated with the system prior to fielding.<BR><BR>13.	Radio frequency dependent components of the Type I LAGCC must not produce electromagnetic emissions that interfere with or degrade the performance of existing platforms, dismounted personnel, instrumentation, weapons, sensors, or communications subsystems operating within its range.  Radio frequency dependent components of the proposed system must comply with applicable national and international spectrum management statutes, policies and regulations, to include obtaining spectrum supportability in all host nations where deployment of the system or equipment is planned.  This includes joint spectrum certification, and host nation coordination.<BR><BR>14. One of the core capabilities of the proposed IBCT vehicle platform is to move rapidly about the battlefield maintaining a vehicle speed of 40 mph on hard surface roads.  The LAGCC must be capable of rapid deployment to critical areas immediately upon notification and have the ability to rapidly relocate in support of and maintain pace with the IBCT. The Type I LAGCC, when mounted onto or towed by the host vehicle, must be capable of sustained hard surface speeds of 40 mph (T) 50 MPH (O).<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  A firm fixed priced contract has been awarded to the Bernard Johnson Corporation of Rockville, Maryland, under contract AG-3K15-C-09-0014, on a sole-source basis for architectural and engineering (A-E) services.  This modification adds the design of the Pilot Plant roof to the Major renovation of the Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania.

This contract is to update the existing design and provide construction administration and oversight during construction.  In order to maintain a single source of liability, if any correction, revisions, or additions are required to be made to the project, they are required to be made by the professional engineer, or a representative within the company, who originally signed and sealed the documents.  The original engineering documents for the project were signed, sealed, and dated by a professional engineer employed by Bernard Johnson Corporation who had prepared and approved the documents.  As such, Bernard Johnson Corporation assumes liability for the design represented by the project engineering documents.

<DESC>NASA-Johnson Space Center awarded Modification 1602 of Contract NAS15-10000 to TheBoeing Company for Phase II development of the International Space Station (ISS) CommonDocking Adapter (CDA) for the United States On-orbit Segment (USOS).  This modification,valued at $15,000,000, applies funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of2009 to CDA assembly, which includes three major components: (1) Common Passive DockingInterface (CPDI), (2) Tunnel, and (3) Passive Common Berthing Mechanism. A CPDI shall becompatible with docking interfaces of Constellation Program Orion and European SpaceAgency Advanced Re-entry Vehicle visiting vehicles being developed for docking to theUSOS.&lt;P&gt;This effort was noncompetitively awarded to The Boeing Company under the NAS15-10000contract.  The Boeing Company is uniquely qualified to perform the Phase II developmentof the ISS CDA based on the unique expertise they possess as a result of having solelydeveloped and integrated the ISS.  Furthermore, for the work required and given the timeconstraints imposed, the existing NAS15-10000 is the most appropriate contractual vehiclefor the preservation of jobs using Recovery Act funds.	&lt;P&gt;This modification was issued using the same cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contractarrangement that was established from the original contract award.  A CPAF arrangement isappropriate due to uncertainties involved in performance of this effort that do notpermit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy for the use of a fixed-pricecontractual vehicle.

<DESC>A competitive mechanism was used.&nbsp; A cost-type contract was chosen because of the high level of uncertainty regarding what excatly will be required to implement this program, as well as the results needed and the funding available. Because the ahievement of hard trgets and/or results will involve the cooperation of outside actors, a completion type contract based on hard targets was not considered realistic. As a result, &nbsp;the contract awarded is a classic example of when what is needed is the contractor's best efforts. As a result a cost-plus- fixed-fee term contract was chosen as the appropriate contract type.<br /><br /><br />

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition(1)   Requesting Agency: 		Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)	Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Regional Offices (RO):Bay Pines/St. Petersburg, FLBoston, MAJackson, MSMuskogee, OKNew York, NY     Contracting Activity:Department of Veterans AffairsInformation Technology Acquisition Center (200/00D)Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin (CAI-A)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Contract GS-35F-4321D (VA contract V200-P2100) for the VA's Avaya Telephone System maintenance and services was awarded to Avaya Federal Solutions, Inc. on December 4, 2008 for a base year plus 4 option years maintenance.  This Telephone system is located in 5 VBA regional offices (Bay Pines, Boston, Jackson, Muskogee and New York). Since the time this contract was put into place, two (2) of the five (5) regions have added additional equipments to their location.  A bilateral modification (SA #03) for Contract: GS-35F-4321D, VA contract: V200-P2100 is required to increase the price for each option year maintenance in order to accommodate for these added equipments.  (3)   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  The task order contains four (4) option years which can be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  The primary task order is scheduled to expire September 30, 2009.  Due to the additional equipments, a need also arises to continue maintenance on these additions and thus the pricing for each option year was altered for this purpose.Modification: estimated increase of $128,255.96. (4)   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.     FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.  The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. (5)  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Avaya Federal Solutions, Inc. has been working on this primary task order since 10/1/2008.  It has completed its base year deliverables under the primary contract and has established a working relationship with the 5 VBA sites. It is extremely familiar with the project, with issues, and with how to solve the issues. It has been instrumental in providing solutions. This modification allows for continuity of maintenance without disruption to operations. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and effort to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Therefore, Avaya Federal Solutions, Inc.  is the only source that will satisfy the needs of VA needs in a cost effective and timely manner. (6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in Far Part 6- Competition requirements. (7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The proposed price alterations were based on previously-negotiated prices under a current government contract which are already determined to be fair and reasonable.  (8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.   Both the new and modified tasks & deliverables are an integral part of the ongoing effort.  The solution for this effort was designed to be an integral part of the current effort being performed by the existing contactor and therefore, market research was not conducted. This solution was predicated on what already existed or was in process and could be extended or modified as part of the current effort so as to minimize the cost to the government. The objectives were to expedite providing the VBA with a workable solution and to minimize costs.   (9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: None.(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.    	No sources. (11)  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  To ensure competition for all future effort, separate competitive procurement will be processed for future addition of equipments and continuation of services needed by the VA, under the GSA schedule or GWAC.  (12) Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).  I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.    _________________________________________                                 _____________Rebecca Carswell, Technical/Requirements Representative                              Date This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.  ____________________________________                                    _______________Nancy Kennamer, Contracting Officer                                                            Date
