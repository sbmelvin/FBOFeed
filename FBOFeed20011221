MSG headquarters is located at 4375 Chidlaw Road, Suite 6, Wright-Patterson AFB OH.  MSG personnel are located on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), OH, in contractor&#8217;s facilities in the Greater Miami Valley (Ohio), and Operating Locations at Hill AFB UT and Tinker AFB OK. <BR><BR> For the past several years&#8217; information technology services, in support of MSG&#8217;s mission requirements, have been provided in accordance with a government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) model.  Hardware, software, network infrastructure components and telecommunications services, and help desk services have been purchased from vendors directly by MSG and are government-owned.  MSG mission requirements for information technology service have outgrown and outpaced the current GOCO model.

Applications of RF MEMS devices and components include, but are not limited to: advanced radar sensors, advanced antennas and communications equipment.  Offerors are free to submit proposals oriented toward capacitive switches, metal-to-metal contact switches or RF MEMS switches designed using another approach. However, because the technical issues are so different between capacitive, metal-to-metal and other switch approaches, offerors may submit separate proposals for each technology.  This program is a two phase effort. Phase I will include development and demonstration of workable design and diagnostic tools, methodologies and capabilities leading to the ability to produce required RF MEMS components, at an affordable cost.  Phase I will culminate, in a pilot (Final benchmark) run of at least 6 lots of functioning RF MEMS wafers (4 wafers/lot).  From these lots, a sufficient number of devices will be selected randomly (i.e., from different lots, different wafers and different positions on the wafers) to constitute a sample size appropriate for a statistical analysis that will demonstrate goals for performance, yield, reliability and component lifetime have been achieved.  A minimum of 100 devices will be selected and enclosed in suitable packages to carry out required tests and analysis of test results. Verification of all testing will be conducted by the government. Phase II will involve a full production run of at least 24 lots of functioning RF MEMS wafers (6 wafers/lot) and subsequent packaging, testing and evaluation of at least 200 functioning MEMS devices or components.   Throughout this program, the Government will conduct independent testing and evaluation of the MEMS devices and components produced during this program. Offerors must be prepared to supply to the Government samples of the devices or test structures that are identical (i.e. from the same lot) to the ones they are using to assess process maturity, device reliability, RF performance, and/or failure mechanisms.  The sample size shall be ten percent of the devices or structures being assessed by the offeror and shall be available for delivery (if requested) at the start of each of the offeror's test cycles.  
Due to the complexity of the tasking and expertise required to perform these various activities, the government strongly encourages teaming for this effort. The offerors shall indicate experience in manufacture and test of MEMS switches (RF or DC); availability of manufacturing facilities, including the ability to control environment and access; availability of failure analysis tools such as SEM, Auger, AFM; microwave test equipment and adequate time guaranteed for the program use of the facilities and equipment described above.

<DESC>The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization is soliciting White Papers for technology development and experiments to increase understanding and capabilities in the area of Kinetic Energy Boost Phase Missile Defense. A kinetic energy boost phase element?s mission is to intercept ballistic missiles prior to termination of powered flight.  This is the most desirable phase in which to engage a missile, since the missile cannot release its warhead(s) and other midcourse countermeasures until powered flight is complete.  At the end of this phase, the missile is traveling as high as 15,000 miles per hour ? making accurate, timely interception a challenge.  Executing this mission also requires quick reaction times, continuous monitoring and vigilance, and high confidence in decision-making.  The objectives of the KE boost program are to identify and develop technology and to achieve a demonstration of the technical feasibility of intercepting primarily ICBM-class missiles in their boost phase by 2005. 

Innovative research approaches are being sought in the kinetic energy boost areas of, (1) technology development and demonstration in the fundamental components of a boost defense element including sensors for early detect, track and identification of the target, advanced interceptors and interceptor subcomponents, battle management, command and control and weapons platforms, and (2) critical experiments that characterize element attributes and timelines as well as demonstrate the feasibility of an effective kinetic energy boost phase concept. Critical experiments will address space based concepts as well as other platforms.  Priority will be given to those ideas which most significantly increase our confidence that a capabilities based kinetic energy boost element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System can be deployed in the next decade. 



DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  PROPOSALS WILL BE REQUESTED AND PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED TO  OFFERORS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED A WHITE PAPER, WHICH HAS RECEIVED A FAVORABLE EVALUATION.  INSTRUCTIONS TO PREPARE AND SUBMIT WHITE PAPERS FOLLOW.  WHITE PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER THE INFORMATIONAL BRIEFING DESCRIBED BELOW ? FROM 11 JANUARY 2002 AND ON.  THEY WILL BE EVALUATED AS THEY ARE RECEIVED.   
  




All interested offerors capable of satisfying the Government?s needs are required to submit three (3) copies of a 3 -5 page (8 ? x 11 inch single spaced) White Paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a foreign firm, a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business, or Historically Black College, University, or Minority Institution.  Foreign firm means a business entity owned or controlled by one or more foreign nationals or a business entity in which more than 50 percent of the stock is owned or controlled by one or more foreign nationals.  No topics have been set aside for small business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI).  
The white papers should be formatted as follows:  Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company, Section B: Task Objective, and Section C: Technical Summary. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Mr. Donald J.  Bobby, Solicitation BAA-02-01, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20301-7100. 

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. If there is sufficient interest in the white paper, a formal technical and cost proposal will be requested.

<DESC>VA VISN 22 Network Business Center intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Rand, Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-01. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. This procurement is to obtain experienced manpower data collection from 270 volunteer veteran participants recently exiting VA-funded residential homeless service programs. The procurement will specifically provide for face-to-face baseline interviewing plus up to four, face-to-face follow-up interviews for a period of one year post-exit. Interviewers and vendor-provided supervisor must demonstrate extensive past experience in interviewing and data collection from similar population.  Desired results are a minimum rate of 100% interview accomplishment on 70% of the 90 project participants from each of three VA-funded program types.

The data collection target is projected to be completed by end of first quarter, calendar year 2003. The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract for base year, with option for one (1) year beyond base year, based on negotiations with only one source for delivery of the aforementioned services to the VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center, Los Angeles CA. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager


The Federal Highway Administration is requesting hydraulic engineering contract support for the design and construction of highway projects for the Federal Lands Highway Program.  The Federal Lands Highway Program provides highway engineering services for the Federal Lands Management Agencies.  The purpose of this scope of work is to specify work items that a Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager (Consultant) will accomplish to help the CFLHD hydraulic engineering staff meet fiscal year 2002 project workload.  The Consultant will be required to be physically located in the CFLHD's Lakewood, Colorado office 80% of the time due to frequent interaction with CFLHD's hydraulic engineering and project development staff.

The following tasks are defined as follows:
Task A:  Consultant will develop a series of written scopes of work for approximately 25 CFLHD highway design projects.  This task will require completing interviews of CFLHD's hydraulic engineering staff, project managers, and others in order to develop an understanding of the hydraulic engineering design functions that will be necessary to proceed to the next task.  The Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager will also complete the project scope for projects not completely defined.  Consultant will also make estimates of the number of hours, cost, and staffing level that will be necessary to complete each project.  Task B:  Based on the scopes of work prepared under Task A, and using the Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager's in-depth knowledge of hydraulic engineering, approximately 25 task orders will be developed that will be used by CFLHD's staff to develop consultant contracts to complete the work.  The task orders will specify design approaches, methodologies, computer programs, and other items that are to be used to complete the project designs.  Task C:  Once the consultant contracts are issued, it will be the responsibility of the Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager to coordinate the completion of the project specific analysis and design with the consultants that have been selected to complete the work.  Consultant must coordinate and maintain communication regarding the status of projects with CFLHD Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR), hydraulics team, project managers, and CFLHD management.  It will also be the incumbent's responsibility to review the completed projects for technical adequacy and accuracy.  If any corrections or modifications are required, the incumbent will coordinate them with the consultant completing the work.  Task D:  Upon completion of a consultant's analysis it will be the responsibility of the Hydraulic Engineering Project Manager to present the results to CFLHD's hydraulic engineering staff.  Once the project has been reviewed by CFLHD hydraulic engineering staff the incumbent will deliver the design documents, reports and, other deliverables to CFLHD's hydraulic engineering staff and project design manager for each completed contract.

Evaluation Factors:  Hydraulic Engineer Experience 20%, Project Management Experience 20%, Technical Ability 20%, Communication Skills 20%, Cost 20%.

The period of performance will be for twelve months, with an approximate start date of February 11, 2002.

Solicitation Packages can be requested by FAX at 303-969-5971, with company name, address, solicitation number, telephone number and fax number of contractor included.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation.

<DESC>DESC: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to competitively procure Regional Oversight Contract (ROC) support services for the EPA Region 9, National Program for Federal Facilities (and to a lesser extent, Potentially Responsible Party (PRP)) Enforcement.  This is a small business set aside procurement (firms with 500 employees or less).  The maximum estimated LOE hours are 109,379 over a base period of five years. This ROC procurement is to provide support to EPA's Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse (FFRR) in its mission of oversight and enforcement of both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at Federal facilities and, to a limited extent, PRP-lead sites within the geographical boundaries of Region 9, which consist of the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Hawaii, over 140 Tribes, the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>In conjunction with the General Services Administration, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Services for The United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and related work in and around the Capitol Building, Washington, DC. The CVC will greatly enhance the experience of visiting the U.S. Capitol building. Not only will it provide new educational opportunities for visitors but it will also improve security, accessibility and visitor comfort. As designed, the CVC will complement the Capitol building and its surroundings and will become a seamless addition to the Capitol complex. The CVC will be located underground on the East Front of the Capitol, so as to enhance rather than detract from the appearance of the Capitol and its historic Frederick Law Olmsted landscaping. When completed, the CVC will contain approximately 580,000 square feet on three levels, requiring approximately a 196,000-square-foot excavation, or "footprint," on the East Front of the Capitol. The CVC will include space for exhibits, visitor comfort, food service, two orientation theaters, an auditorium, gift shops, security, connections to existing buildings, service tunnels for underground vehicle access to the Capitol, loading docks, mechanical facilities, and storage. The CVC will preserve and maximize public access to the Capitol while greatly enhancing the experience for the millions who walk its historic corridors and experience its monumental spaces every year. This solicitation will address only a portion of the work required to complete the CVC, as noted below. The Architect of the Capitol will utilize a ?best value? source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement. The project will be constructed in sequences and requires extensive coordination between this contractor and contractors of prior and subsequent sequences of the work as well as with contractors performing other AOC projects in the immediate vicinity of the project. This advertisement is for SEQUENCE 1B of the project which includes, but is not limited to, CONCRETE STRUCTURE INCLUDING SLAB ON METAL DECK AND THE WORKING SLAB BELOW THE SITE PAVERS, STEEL STRUCTURE, WATERPROOFING, ELEVATOR HOLES, AND TUNNELS INCLUDING THE TRUCK TUNNEL TO NEW JERSEY AVENUE, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TUNNEL, THE HOUSE CONNECTOR TUNNEL AND THE UTILITY TUNNEL OUT EAST CAPITOL STREET.  The estimated construction cost for SEQUENCE 1B is in the range of $40 to $55 million. The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet AOC requirements. The Contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings, and the provisions of the contract. The solicitation for Sequence IB will be issued in two (2) phases. Phase I will be for technical proposals and will include a set of draft specifications and drawings. It will be available on or about 01/21/2002. UNDER THIS PHASE THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVALUATE PAST PERFORMANCE, TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED OF THEIR TECHNICAL STANDING PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF PHASE II, WHICH WILL BE A REQUEST FOR OFFERORS OF HIGH TECHNICAL STANDING TO SUBMIT PRICING PROPOSALS BASED UPON COMPLETED SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS. Phase II of the solicitation will be issued approximately 45 days after receipt of proposals for Phase I. The government will award a fixed-price contract after evaluation of Phase I and Phase II proposals resulting from this solicitation to the responsive and responsible offeror determined by the government to be the ?best value? to the government. Under this solicitation, Technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, bu

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for 105 units of a 36V NiCd battery bundle (P/N SRI-0300) for the X-38 Program.  The 36V NiCd battery bundle consists of 30 NiCd cells connected in series with low impedance cell interconnects for delivering 42 A, 100 ms pulses without sagging below 29V.  They are to be constructed with high temperature tolerant materials to safely tolerate short circuits of 105 milliohms without fire or rupture.  The batteries must have embedded thermostats (75 deg C) for external temperature control.  They must have high power connectors with 12 inch, 10 guage pigtails for easy plug in.  The Battery bundles delivered must pass OCV, capacity, and internal resistance tests.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from  Symmetry Resources, Inc.,(SRI), in Arab, AL.  The justification for other than full and open competition is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(a) (FAR 6.302-1).  The design of the specified battery bundle is unique and proprietary to SRI.  Attempts to find other sources for an equivalent battery unit have revealed that significant development tests would be required prior to initiating requalification with parafoil tests.  This would put an additional cost burden on the government.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 4, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Additional information is hereby provided regarding the synopsis for the Conformal Antenna posted 07 November 2001:

1.  Question:  Where is the antenna mounted on each aircraft?
Answer: As stated in the synopsis, the antenna will be mounted on the top fuselage of the aircraft. 
2.  Question:  Is the curvature of the aircraft different for the 3 different aircraft type?  C/D, E/F, EA-6?  When will this information be provided to us (i.e. how many conformal designs are required)?
Answer:  The fuselage curvature of the F/A-18 C/D, F/A-18 E/F, and EA-6B are different. Thus, it is possible to have as many as three different conformal designs, which is dependent how the offeror/s proposes. The non-LO variant maximum allowable protrusion is 0.5 inches above the aircraft mode line.
3.  Question:  Is LO version going to be a classified piece of equipment?  If so, when does it become classified?
Answer:  Security classification of the LO variant will be provided in the potential Request for Proposal (RFP) but for planning purposes, it should be considered classified.
4.  Question:  Are the spec valves in the table relative to the antenna alone or for the antenna mounted to the aircraft/platform?
Answer:  Any spec values issued in the conformal CRPA specification will be for the CRPA only.
5.  Will testing be required on a surface representative of the F-18 and EA-6 or test the antenna alone on the chine?  Who is responsible for testing the antenna with the AE?  Who verified the compatibility of the antenna to the AE?   
Answer:  Testing of the antenna to determine patterns, etc. will be conducted on the CRPA ground plane located at Patuxent River, MD. RCS measurements will be (in free space) conducted using a fixture at Boeing Corp. or one of its subcontractors. Qualification requirements will also be part of the potential RFP. Responsibility for testing of the antenna and verification of its compatibility with the antenna electronics will be the Government. Use of the Government antenna test facilities is possible at a cost; however, there are no assurances of its availability. Estimated lead-time to schedule a test ranges from 1 to 2 months.
6.  Question:  What spec is required for Vibration, Acoustics, EMI, Vulnerability?
Answer:  The F/A-18 platform specification requirements will be used for vibration, acoustics, EMI, and vulnerability. This specification will be part of the potential RFP. 
7.  Question:  When will the Bidders' Conference to be held?
Answer:  The Conformal Antenna Conference is currently being planned for late January to early February.
8.  When will the RFP be released?
Answer:  As stated in the synopsis, the Government will make a determination whether to request proposals. 
9.  What is the distribution of the LO and non-LO in the total quantity of 1175?
Answer:  Potential RFP (base year with multiple option years) is estimated for 1175 production antennas only; 545 LO and 630 non-LO. 
10.  Are Bid Samples of both LO and non-LO antennas required?
Answer:  "Bid samples" will be for the LO version only. 
11.  Question:  The 15 preproduction units - Does this refer to 15 each LO & non-LO or some other distribution of quantity?
Answer:  15 production antennas (7 LO; 8 non-LO).
12. Question:  What are the qualification requirements?
Answer:  Any spec values listed in the conformal CRPA specification will be issued with the RFP, which will be similar to the GAS-1 CRPA.
13.   Question:  Will the antenna remain as a separate procurement from the AE?
Answer:  Yes
14.  Question:  What is the protrusion depth that is allowed?
Answer: Refer to Question No. 2 and No. 20.
15.  Question:  What is the duration of production deliveries?  Will the development and production be one contract?

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration intends to modify its Cooperative Agreement with the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) to add an additional project.  The project is a special study that will evaluate Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) for Vehicle Safety Applications.  This cost sharing modification will be awarded under Cooperative Agreement No. DTFH61-01-X-00014.  The projected 2 year special study will seek to ensure that DSRC standards currently under development by the American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM) will fully support vehicle safety applications.  A critical element of the project is the need for participating automotive manufacturers to identify DSRC related vehicle safety applications that show the most promising safety benefits and also show the greatest potential for its near term deployment.  In addition, information developed under the Enhanced Digital Maps project will be integral to the study that will also correlate safety and cost sensitivity factors related to system deployment. The major objectives of this study will be accomplished by: 1) Identifying the potential of DSRC based safety applications in terms of lives saved, costs saved and deployment feasibility; 2) Clearly defining the communications requirements of the most valuable applications so as to guide the development of DSRC communications standards; 3) Developing prototypes of specific DSRC enabled applications to validate communications requirements, and DSRC performance; 4) Assessing DSRC communications protocols for safety needs; 5) Providing guidance for standards development organizations.  Parties who feel they possess the capabilities to successfully perform the special study referenced in this announcement should submit a letter of interest to the FHWA, along with their relevant experience, qualifications and capabilities to the following address: Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, D.C.  20590.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: On Line Training Curriculum via SSA's Intranet for Employee Utilization. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking a qualified vendor who can supply SSA with COTS Software to be placed on the SSA Intranet for use by SSA employees nationwide for self directed training in various MS Applications.  Suppliers must have their software available on GSA Schedule Contract No Later Than JUNE 1, 2001. The Social Security Administration_s Vision 2010 calls for the use of state-of-the-art technology to have fully prepared and trained employees. SSA has approximately 70,000 employees dispersed throughout 1,700 facilities cross the nation. All SSA employees have and utilize a personal computer running MS WINDOWS NT. The on-line training software must function efficiently on the SSA systems architecture (Currently _ TokenRing transitioning to Ethernet, and 56KB lines transitioning to frame relay/ATM & greater bandwidth capacity.) These workstations are equipped with the full suite of Microsoft Office software products. SSA employees need to have access to on-line training in a _just-in-time_ fashion. The content of the courseware will include, but would not be limited to, the following listing of courses: Office Automation Courses: MS Office 97 & 2000 Application Suite Including MS WORD; Excel; Access; Internet Explorer 5.0; FrontPage 98 & 2000; PowerPoint; Project; Outlook  98 & 2000; Exchange plus any New Features Lessons; along with Window NT 4.0 & 2000. All courseware would need to be made available to all employees who have access to the SSA Intranet. Other training content requirement needs have not been identified at this time.  However, additional course content may be considered on an as-needed basis.  On-line training products must meet the following list of technical requirements. The on-line training software must run on the Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 or higher.  Java environment functionality must be met by the standard IWS/LAN browser configuration. On-line training courses should be offered, where appropriate, in two or more levels of student training needs; i.e. beginner, intermediate, & advanced. On-line training courses must  available to students in an anonymous mode. Functionality for student tracking, record keeping, course completion, testing, and evaluation will be  required as part of this training solution.  However,these functionalities will not be deployed at this time, pending development of an overall Agency training administration system. To the extent required by Section 508 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, on-line training software must be accessible to employees with disabilities within SSA.  On-line training software upgrades must be made available under the lease agreement.  New versions of the on-line training software must be made available to SSA within 90 days of the COTS software release to the general public.  The on-line training software will be deployed as part of the Office of training_s Intranet web page.  The on-line training software must be deployable on this SSA web-server.  Hosted off-site web-based training delivery systems are not under consideration at this time. On-line training software will need to be tested and approved by the SSA Systems and End-User communities prior to lease agreement.  On-line training software that is AICC and SCORM compliant will be weighted favorably.  The on-line training software must not utilize any workstation plug-ins. Sound or video functionality is not required for this on-line training software. If sound or video functionality exists in the on-line training software, it must be deployable in a fashion that allows the Agency (or the user) to turn-off these features to avoid sending unnecessary traffic to the user and without any detrimental impact to systems performance or the training experience.  Any organization which believes it has the relevant COTS Software should submit a Technical Proposal/Capability

<DESC>The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineer (SIAP SE), in concert with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO), solicit interest for participation in controlled laboratory and field demonstrations to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) systems. Using a multiphase approach, the demonstrations will use live data inputs in the Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team 2002 (JCIET 02) field-environment, 15-26 Apr 02, as well as recorded inputs for subsequent phases in the Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) environment.  Phase One will be conducted during JCIET 02 and will require passive operation of each participating MSI system (no output to the data links, no local sensor integration).  Phases Two and Three will be conducted in the JDEP environment.  Specifically, Phase Two will require passive operation, but the systems will be able to use local sensors; Phase Three will put the MSI systems into the network as active participants, enabling MSI nodes at each sensor to share data among each other.  Quantitative comparisons of the various MSI systems' composite track-file databases to the available truth data will be the criterion for determining the baseline performance.  Results from each of the three phases of this demonstration will be used to provide recommendations for operational, technical, and interoperability standards for an objective fusion/correlation capability that maps to Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated requirements. 

An Industry Day Briefing of the MSI System Demonstration will be held on Tuesday, 15 Jan 02, as part of the JCIET 02 Final Planning Conference being conducted at the Mississippi Air National Guard (ANG) Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC), Gulfport, MS.   Vendors interested in attending the Industry Briefing shall register via the JCIET website (https://jciet.eglin.af.mil).  For detailed Industry Day Briefing agenda information, vendors should contact LCDR Kevin Redman (reference contact information below).  SECRET Security clearance will be required for participants.  Submit Security clearance information as specified below.

Vendors interested in participating in the MSI System Demonstration must submit their notification of intent and both name and description of their MSI system, as specified below, for government review by 31 Jan 02.  The government will formally invite prospective-candidate MSI systems for participation via written notification not later than 15 Feb 02.  Non-candidates will be provided supporting rationale for their exclusion from this demonstration, but they may be eligible for participation in future events.  Note: The intent of these demonstrations is for data collection purposes only and will not result in a contract award.

BACKGROUND 
Multi-Source Integration (MSI) is the process that (1) performs association/correlation and fusion of target track and measurement data received over a variety of tactical and intelligence data networks (e.g., Link 11, Link 16, CEC, TIBS, and Live Radar) to create and maintain a composite track-file database, and (2) combines a priori data with dynamic data.  The MSI systems may have organic sensors that contribute to the composite track-file database, and they may also have the capability to both transmit and receive data on the various data links. 

The following are previous MSI studies that form the basis for the MSI demonstrations:
- MSI System Engineering Team sponsored by the Combat System Functional Allocation Board, 1995-7 
- Time Variant Multi-Hypothesis Correlator Assessment, ACIET 00 Theater Air and Missile Defense Interoperability (TAMD I) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration, sponsored by USJFCOM, 2000-1

Results from these studies demonstrated that fusion/correlation techniques, algorithms, and technologies were mature, but that th

Specifically, Phase Two will require passive operation, but the systems will be able to use local sensors; Phase Three will put the MSI systems into the network as active participants, enabling MSI nodes at each sensor to share data among each other.  Quantitative comparisons of the various MSI systems' composite track-file databases to the available truth data will be the criterion for determining the baseline performance.  Results from each of the three phases of this demonstration will be used to provide recommendations for operational, technical, and interoperability standards for an objective fusion/correlation capability that maps to Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-validated requirements.  An Industry Day Briefing of the MSI System Demonstration will be held on Tuesday, 15 Jan 02, as part of the JCIET 02 Final Planning Conference being  conducted at the Mississippi Air National Guard (ANG) Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC), Gulfport, MS.   Vendors interested in attending the Industry Briefing shall register via the JCIET website (https://jciet.eglin.af.mil).  For detailed Industry Day Briefing agenda information, vendors should contact LCDR Kevin Redman (reference contact information below).  SECRET Security clearance will be required for participants.  Submit Security clearance information as specified below. Vendors interested in participating in the MSI System Demonstration must submit their notification of intent and both name and description of their MSI system, as specified below, for government review by 31 Jan 02.  The government will formally invite prospective-candidate MSI systems for participation via written notification not later than 15 Feb 02.  Non-candidates will be provided supportin g rationale for their exclusion from this demonstration, but they may be eligible for participation in future events.  Note: The intent of these demonstrations is for data collection purposes only and will not result in a contract award. BACKGROUND  Multi-Source Integration (MSI) is the process that (1) performs association/correlation and fusion of target track and measurement data received over a variety of tactical and intelligence data networks (e.g., Link 11, Link 16, CEC, TIBS, and Live Radar) to create and maintain a composite track-file database, and (2) combines a priori data with dynamic data.  The MSI systems may have organic sensors that contribute to the composite track-file database, and they may also have the capability to both transmit and receive data on the various data links.  The following are previous MSI studies that form the basis for the MSI demon strations: - MSI System Engineering Team sponsored by the Combat System Functional Allocation Board, 1995-7  - Time Variant Multi-Hypothesis Correlator Assessment, ACIET 00 Theater Air and Missile Defense Interoperability (TAMD I) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration, sponsored by USJFCOM, 2000-1 Results from these studies demonstrated that fusion/correlation techniques, algorithms, and technologies were mature, but that there was a lack

<DESC>Statement of Work 	The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to Request Information about possibly establishing the terms of an ordering arrangement between the Direct Support Stock Control Section (DSSC) at MCB Camp S. D. Butler in Okinawa, Japan and an Office Supply Vendor for the acquisition and distribution of office supplies, furniture and other consumable items (beginning with approximately 14 Federal Supply Groups and approximately 1,440 Line Items). The USMC Regional Contracting Office at MCB Camp Butler would also use this Ordering Agreement.  The Javits-Wagner O’Day Act (JWOD) applies and the Vendor must have a contract with the General Services Administration (GSA).  The following steps will be executed to implement this agreement: Inventory Preparation 	Inventory preparation involves identification of ordering patterns, cross-referencing of items to  National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and stocking of items in a Vendor’s Northern California warehouse location. 	Ordering Patterns.  DSSC of MCB Camp Butler, Okinawa, Japan will provide ordering information on the items they intend to purchase from the Office Supply Vendor.  This will be used to identify initial buy-ins of stock into a Northern California location.  The intention is that the Office Supply Vendor will carry a 30-day supply on items committed for purchase by DSSC. (If DSSC determines to no longer purchase individual items or all items, the Office Supply Vendor would receive a one-month order for supplies that would be purchased before termination of the agreement.)  The Office Supply Vendor shall assist DSSC with an inventory control process/system as requested by DSSC.  This would not involve an additional cost to DSSC.   	Cross-Referencing Items.  The Vendor’s Sup ply system will accommodate the local and other NSNs to be used by DSSC for ordering.  In order to match the appropriate Vendor’s items to the DSSC stock, the Vendor will assist DSSC in cross-referencing the NSNs.  These NSNs (local and other regular NSNs) will then be set up in the Vendor’s Supply system for use by DSSC.  All NSNs will appear on the Vendor’s ordering system, on order confirmations (email or fax back) and on packing slips.  To assist DSSC, sign-ons for the Vendor’s Internet system will be provided as requested.  This will allow access to the on-line catalog.  A key process will be for DSSC and the Vendor to use both parties’ On-line catalog (DSSC U/Call, We Haul; OfficeSupplyVendor.com).  DSSC will identify all items requiring a cross-reference to the Vendor.  For example, if an item has a national stock number ( NSN ) and DSSC will utilize it, a cross-referenc e would not be needed.  All other items would require a NSN, which would be set up by DSSC and given to the Vendor. 	Stocking of Items.  As previously defined, DSSC will identify items they intend to buy from the Vendor.  The Office Supply Vendor will stock these items preferably in a Northern California warehouse.  The intention is to begin with core office supply items and furniture with possible expansion into other commodities such as janitorial supplies and tools.  DSSC has identified a benefit in utilizing a one-stop source for office supplies. 	The Vendor shall notify DSSC of any shortages of items within 24 hours.  The Vendor will also notify DSSC of new items being stocked in the Vendor’s Inventory.   An important goal of this program is for the DSSC to stock quality merchandise in attractive packaging in order to attract and retain its customer base. Ordering Pro cedures 	This section involves documentation for supporting orders, the requisition process and options for on-line ordering.  It also addresses the Points Of Contact at the Vendor to support the ordering process. 	Documentation.  A Requirements document will be utilized to direct funding to DSSC for the purpose of ordering supplies.  This will be set up by the RCO.  It will also include a separate CLIN and requirement for shipping of expedited orders

<DESC>BACKGROUND:

On October 9 2001, the Defense Logistics Agency announced public-private competitions for the selected functions of warehouse logistics at 61 Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMOs) worldwide. The functions include:  receiving, stowing and issuing property, inventory accountability and customer assistance.  This competition process follows the guidelines described in OMB Circular A-76.  Further information can be obtained at www.supply.dla.mil/a76 . This survey is to solicit ideas and opinions pertaining to this competition.  Your participation in this market research and a prompt response (preferably by December 28, 2001) is appreciated and valuable to the process.  

SURVEY:

1.  Would you be interested in submitting a proposal for the functions performed at the DRMOs?

2. If not, why?

3.  Would you prefer to see the DRMOs competed in groups?  If you prefer grouping do you have any recommendations?

4.  Do you see a potential for application of ?share-in-savings? provisions?  Share-in-savings as it applies here is the return to the contractor of a portion of any savings that can be directly attributed to the contractor?s actions.  Some examples of what might apply to the DRMOs include reductions in footprint or utilities consumption.

5.  Recent solicitations have included an award term incentive clause.  The Government may approve additional option periods as an incentive to motivate and reward exceptional performance.  What is your opinion of this incentive mechanism?

6.  It is anticipated that all sites under study may not have a need to be staffed.  Would appreciate your comments pertaining to this objective.



Responses, comments or questions may be directed to DRMS_A76@dscc.dla.mil.  If you desire to be added to our DRMS mailing list, please provide your company name and address, name of a point of contact, phone number and e-mail address.  If you respond, please indicate if you would like to see the responses (non-attribution, of course) posted at the web site.  Thank you in advance for your assistance in our acquisition planning.

<DESC>The Joint Project Office for Special Technology Countermeasures (JPO-STC) at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is seeking qualified sources to provide technical support for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) aspects of the Infrastructure Assurance Program (IAP).  The purpose of the IAP is to provide DOD decision makers, Commanders-in-Chiefs (CINCs), and operational commanders with an analysis and assessment capability to identify critical infrastructure susceptibilities and operational dependencies that, if not assured, could adversely impact mission accomplishment of military operations vital to national security.  The CIP is concerned primarily with assisting DOD agencies and organizations in characterizing business processes and interdependencies through identification of mission, functions, systems, and assets, i.e., identifying the unique ass ets that support warfighting missions and operations.     As appointed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (OASD-C3I), the JPO-STC provides CIP guidance and direction to the following ten (10) Defense Infrastructure (DI) Sectors:  Command, Control, and Communications (C3); Defense Information Infrastructure (DII); Financial Services; Health Affairs; Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Logistics; Personnel; Public Works; Transportation; and Space.  The purpose of this sources sought is to identify existing industry capabilities for providing technical support to the JPO-STC for these sectors.  These sectors, and their respective cognizant DOD agencies/offices, are:   C3 - Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Financial Services - Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Heal th Affairs - Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Health Affairs  (OASD/Health Affairs) Logistics - Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Personnel - Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) Public Works - U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Transportation - United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) DII - Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) ISR - Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Space - United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) Additional information about the JPO-STC and the IAP is available at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/iap. The JPO-STC has determined that contractor support may be required in the following top-level functional areas:  DI sector characterization and asset identification, including the identification of intra-sector dependencies as well as inter-dependencies and linkages between multiple sectors and/or other entities; development of  systems/processes to integrate, collate, and display DI sector assets; and the identification of analytical tools, capabilities and requirements unique to individual sectors.  These capabilities would be intended to assist in the definition of the unique business process relationships between and among specific/unique assets, thereby allowing comprehensive analysis and assessment of critical components and fault isolation for risk management and mitigation.   Based on responses received, an acquisition approach/strategy for fulfilling requirements in this area will be determined.  It is currently planned to formally solicit requirements beginning in the second quarter of FY02 with award(s) beginning in late FY02/early FY03.   Responders shall provide the following: 1.  Identify the specific sectors where you have existing expertise.  Describe this expertise and discus s at least in general terms how this expertise is relevant to the Government's needs as described above. 2.  For each sector, identify current/recently completed contracts (contract number, awarding activity, value, period of performance, and PCO name/phone). 3.  For each sector, describe the nature of the technical support currently being provided.  Also characterize the support being provided in terms of annual technical level of effort. 4.

<SUBJECT>66 -- GUAVA PERSONAL CYTOMETER
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE -- The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH), Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch (TMBB), HELD in Morgantown, WV has a need for a Guava Personal Cytometer (GPC) to investigate the cellular response to occupational skin exposures, cell number, viability, and induction of apoptosis for all isolated primary cell cultures for projects undertaken by the Morgantown Dermatotoxicology Laboratory under TMBB.  We specifically plan to purchase the following items from Guava Technologies, Inc., Burlingame, CA:  (1) Cat # 0500-0010, Guava PC  which includes Guave Cell Counting and Viability Software module, Protein Expression Analysis Software module, Apoptosis Analysis Software module; (2) Guava ViaCount  cell counting and viability reagents; and  (3) Guave Check Kit.   This unit is able to perform multiple assays: cell counts, cell viability assays and apoptosis assays.  The machine requires only 5,000 to 10,000 cells for each analysis, an important feature when there is a limited number of primary cells obtained from a cell isolation.  Cell count and viability use a combination of two fluorescent dyes, one which identifies all cells, the other that identifies dead cells.  The machine has dedicated software and downloads measurements into an Excel spreadsheet for easy analysis.  The equipment does not require special training,  thus providing ease of use to other laboratories within the NIOSH, TMBB.  There is no other known source available, however, if there are vendors having the capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements, they are invited to submit  appropriate documentation, literature, brochures and references  to Brenda L. Goodwin, Reference: 2002-Q-00311,  DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  Telephone inquiries or fax confirmations should be made to 304/285-5882, fax 304/285-6083.  Organizations shall respond as soon as possible, but no later than noon local prevailing time on December 28, 2001.  Information received will generally be used  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is issued for informational purposes only.
