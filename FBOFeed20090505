As Serena Dimensions software is the best value manufacturer which produces ALM software, and they have been determined to be the best value for performing the necessary customization and user training necessary to implement the ALM solution for the US Army, the RDECOM Contracting Center has decided to award this purchase order as a sole source acquisition.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - 32 Channel Data Acquisition System<BR><BR>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Aberdeen Installation Contracting Division intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, for the acquisition of a 32 Channel Data Acquisition System produced by Mars Labs of Laurel, MD for the U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center.  The requested data acquisition system, Mars EBRT 2400, is a proprietary system that integrates 32-channels of configurable signal conditioning with high speed digitization, on-board solid-state data storage, and high speed communications.  The system is also unique in that is has incorporated Aberdeen Test Centers VISION compliant software structure and command-control architecture, a feature vital to the ATC upgrade for the acquisition, processing, and storage of test data. Mars Labs owns the proprietary design and manufacturing technical data necessary for the construction of the EBRT system, and is the only supplier of the system. There are no other known systems having the required capability.  Additionally, this request is a continuation of an ATC effort to upgrade its automotive test data acquisition and processing capability. The same system has been acquired under previous contracts; W91ZLK-08-P-1476, W91ZLK-08-P-1246, and W91ZLK-07-P-0870.  Future procurements must obtain the identical system to permit interchangeability of components/modules, reduce new equipment training needs, allow physical and electrical interface compatibility, and minimize down time due to maintenance and repair requirements. Being that Mars Labs is the original equipment manufacturer, and presently is the only producer which can meet US Army needs, the RDECOM Aberdeen Installation Contracting Division has decided to award this purchase order as a sole source acquisition.  No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for issuing Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) where contractor(s) provide professional photography and videography services for fire activities across the Western U.S. for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, with four additional one-year option periods.  Contractor(s) must have attended and received a certificate for Basic Firefighter Training, S-130/190, attended Annual Wildland Firefighter Refresher Training and passed the Fitness Test at the arduous level.  The Government will provide additional optional fire fighter training as requested, but shall not compensate the Contractor(s) for time spent in training or transportation to and from the training.  Overnight lodging or camping may be required.  The Contractor(s) is responsible for meals, lodging and incidental expenses.  However, the Contractor may reside in fire camp for the duration of the assignment at no charge.  It is anticipated that the Government will award multiple BPA actions for one year plus four option years, through May 31, 2014.  BPA "call" orders for each individual job will then be offered, between those BPA contractors, as per their location, and availablility for the activity requirement and services offered. Blanket Purchase Agreements are NOT contracts, and serve only in that the contractor and government agree, that should the government request, and the contractor accept an assignment, the price for that work is predetermined by the BPA.  Solicitation L09PS00479 is scheduled to be released on or about May 6,2009.  This requirement is set-aside for small business under NAICS Code 541922 (average annual receipts for the preceding 3 fiscal years not to exceed $7 million). Product Service codes for this action are both T010 and T015. Facsimile proposals will be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http//www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award. Questions regarding this action may be directed to Patrick Lorton at (208)387-5717

<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates the award of a single Firm-Fixed Price, Construction Contract. The intent of this notice is to seek a contractor to replace the existing non-lethal/lethal fence system high voltage lead out wire at four Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities: USP Tucson, AZ; USP Pollock, LA; USP Terre Haute, IN; and USP McCreary, KY. All four project sites are existing high security United States Penitentiaries. During installation, the Offeror will be required to coordinate and cooperate with institution staff to maintain the security of the institution perimeter, including preparation and approval of security/security background checks in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 and local institution requirements for entry to the respective active USP. The Non-Lethal/Lethal Electrified Fence system consists of approximately 5500' of high voltage fence structure which is divided into zones; Concrete grade beams and sidewalks which flank the system; underground high voltage feed and return conductors, several per zone; Energizer cabinets and enclosures; Underground pull boxes; Buried rigid conduit; Computerized head end equipment; Safety interlocks and grounding system; Surge protection and riser connections. The lead-out cable is comprised of a 14 AWG steel core encased in a low density poly ethylene inner jacket coupled with a high density poly ethylene outer jacket. Due to a faulty extrusion process, the inner jacket is cracking and deteriorating, thus burning holes in the outer jacket which in turn grounds the system out.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for performing specific interrelated tasks as outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). These tasks will include, but not be limited to, 1) removing all existing non-lethal/lethal fence high voltage lead out and riser cable; 2) replacing the non-lethal/lethal fence high voltage lead out and riser cable with new cable as specified in the SOW; 3) determining wire quantity by confirming wire distances at each facility; 4) testing the cable for shorts and opens prior to the cable termination in accordance with the cable manufacturers recommendations; 5) terminating the new high voltage cable to the fence structure, surge arresters, safety relays and energizers; and 6) coordinating the non-lethal/lethal fence manufacturer for an onsite inspection and system tuning prior to re-energizing the system. The anticipated performance period of this contract is to have first delivery by July 30, 2009, after the initial notices to proceed is issued. The performance period of each installation is 30 calendar days, with coordinated staggered notice to proceed. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238210.

<DESC><p>The Office of Personnel Management oversees BENEFEDS, which is a web-based portal that currently handles enrollment and premium administration services for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) and payroll allotment services for the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS).
<p>The intent of this procurement is to first replicate the current BENEFEDS portal functionality, and then expand the Portal into a "One Stop Shop" for the insurance and cafeteria plan (Section 125) benefits OPM administers, to include FSAFEDS. This will require interfaces with multiple agencies and plan providers, and a solution that is technically flexible and forward thinking enough to accomplish this goal. In addition to the BENEFEDS portal functionality, this procurement also includes a call center and customer service component. OPM requests that offerors keep in mind the ever changing human resources environment and propose solutions that enable robust manager and employee self-service applications. OPM also requests that offerors propose solutions that enable near real-time updates to accommodate business decisions requiring immediate action. Finally, the goal of a "One Stop Shop" for benefits requires a solution that can support robust system architecture, with the potential to host many thousands of concurrent users, and provide surge capabilities with little or no interruption to the BENEFEDS community.</p>
<p>To achieve its goal of a "One Stop Shop," OPM intends to maintain and improve upon the current Portal and call center functionality by:</p>
<p>1. Replicating FEDVIP Enrollment and Premium Administration, FSAFEDS Premium <br />Administration, basic decision support tools, and call center services;</p>
<p>2. Expanding the BENEFEDS portal to include:</p>
<p>&bull; FLTCIP (Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program) Premium Administration <br />&bull; User Interface Redesign <br />&bull; FSAFEDS Enrollment</p>
<p>3. With potential future expansion to include:</p>
<p>&bull; A full suite of benefit and financial Decision Support Tools as well as individual personal health records<br />&bull; FEHB (Federal Employees Health Benefits) Program Enrollment, Premium Administration, and Reconciliation <br />&bull; FEGLI (Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance) Program Enrollment, Premium Administration and Reconciliation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available through the internet at: www.fedbizopps.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring Fed Biz Opps for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Contractors are encouraged to sign-up on the fedbizopps.gov website, for email notification of all actions relevant to this solicitation, and on the interested vendors list, also listed at the bottom of this announcement.</p>
<p>The anticipated date for release of a solicitation is June 1, 2009. Once the solicitation is released, offerors will be given an opportunity to ask questions and answers will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>Responses to this Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. Award of this requirement is anticipated by September 30, 2009.</p>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support of the Center Operations SupportServices (COSS) contract which provides operations and maintenance of all MSFC facilitiesand collateral equipment and other related functions. These activities emphasizesupporting the missions of MSFC in a safe, reliable and timely manner, with minimumdisruptions to the facility occupants/users.  Functions are performed by skilledcraftsmen/technicians.	Some MSFC employees are located at off-Center locations so theContractor is requested, from time-to-time, to support a MSFC activity such as relocatingequipment to an off-Center location for use, storage, off-Center recognition ceremonies,or other special events.The COSS contract is Firm-Fixed Price contract and consists of a base (lump sum) and anIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) instrument.  NASA/MSFC intends to increasethe current IDIQ contract ceiling by $3M for the base year which is required because thelimit has been reached and there still remains a requirement for urgent operations andmaintenance work during the remaining two months.  The request is also for an increase toeach of the four remaining option years by $10M per year.At this time, there is no intention to extend the period of performance of the currentcontract July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2013 and no new noncompetitive contract instrumentwill be awarded with approval of this action.  The contract will be modified to increasethe IDIQ ceiling value only.  Without approval of this action, the current contractceiling for IDIQ work will be expended in the May 2009 timeframe, in advance of thecurrent base year end date (June 30, 2009), and contract performance would have to stopat that time.The IDIQ ceiling increase for the COSS contract will ensure the continuation of serviceto mission critical buildings and operating systems that can be restored to ensure safeand reliable facilities that support program and mission goals.  EG&G Technical Serviceshas been the support contractor providing the critical operations and maintenance to MSFCfacilities, collateral equipment and other related functions.  As a result, EG&GTechnical Services has developed within their management staff a unique knowledge andunderstanding of the work requirements, operations, and policies across MSFC.  Use ofEG&G Technical Services existing and proven capabilities will permit timely execution ofsignificant tasks that are necessary for achieving program and mission goals.  Are-competition of the COSS contract would introduce considerable schedule risks andunacceptable delays to the program and mission goals.  This recommendation for approval is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), for the acquisition ofsupplies and services from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies orservices will satisfy agency requirements.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii),services may be deemed to be available from the original source for the continuedprovision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other sourcewould result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  Competitionis impractical for the following reasons:The ceiling value for IDIQ work for the base year has been reached with two monthsremaining.  This is largely due to work done for the Office of Chief Information Officerfor communication restorations and upgrades at Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in theamount of $2.2M that couldnt be accomplished under the existing MAF contracts.  Failureto increase the ceiling value would result in delays that would be very costly and resultin serious impact to urgent operation and maintenance activities and commitments.  Therequest for a ceiling value increase of $10M for each of the four remaining option yearsis for work that was unanticipated when the scope of work for the contract was prepared. The unanticipated workload is largely due to a significant increase in work to supportthe ARES program and the associated mission critical facilities.  The facilityinfrastructure provides institutional support for the Ares and Shuttle programs.  Themagnitude of breakdown and repair work has been steadily increasing over the past severalyears and is due to the increasing age of the mission critical buildings and thecorresponding facility systems.  The upward trend is expected to continue because thesebuildings, which average 40 years of age, have exceeded their expected design life.  Pursuant to NFS 1804.570, this proposed contract action will be published on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and pursuant to FAR 5.201; this proposed contractaction will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities.  There have been nowritten expressions of interest in this acquisition action to date.  However, if any arereceived as a result of the NAIS publication or the Federal Business Opportunitiessynopsis, they will be appropriately disposition and documented by addendum to thisdocument. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 19, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely fordetermining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

The Government intends to procure integration for interface cable/adapter sets for MV-22 Mission Auxiliary Tank System Capacitance Testing, production of H-60 cable/adapter sets, and production of P-3 cable/adapter sets to be used with the TTU-597/E Fuel Quantity Test Set (FQTS). This will accomplished under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. Ultra Electronics LTD is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole source designer, manufacturer, and integrator for the FQTS. The FQTS is a portable test set used to test fuel quantity probes and indicators of various Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to verify that aircraft fuel quantity gauges are indicating correct fuel levels.

Ultra Electronics LTD is the sole developer and manufacturer of the FQTS. Ultra Electronics LTD has the necessary workforce, technical expertise and developmental facilities to fulfill the requirement within the required schedule. In order to comprehensively complete the integrations, and fulfill the requirement in the most timely manner, it would require the contractor to be intimate with the FQTS, the associated aircraft platforms, and the relationship to other systems on the aircraft. Without this unique and specific knowledge, the work would not be accomplished in a timely or efficient manner. The Government does not currently possess the data necessary to provide for the integration of the MV-22 interface cable/adapter sets; therefore Ultra Electronics LTD is the only source who can accomplish the requirement in the necessary timeframe. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Mental Health Services (SCMHS), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Advocates for Human Potential, 490-B
Boston Post Road, Sudbury, MA 01776.

The purpose of this professional services contract is to obtain services of a contractor to provide speechwriting, speech editing and speech coaching services. The Center Director and other key Center officials give many speeches on mental health issues to inform the public, state and local officials, constituency groups, families, teachers, businesses, and a wide variety of groups about vital mental health issues. CMHS requires the services of a contractor to supplement its in-house work. Work will be performed by the contractor on an individual task basis, at the request of Director, when such services are needed. It is critical that effective speeches are given to convey the information about public mental health issues.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks:

The Contractor will perform technical and speech writing/copyediting/rewriting as well as developing PowerPoint presentations as assigned for the OD, CMHS in support of the Centers mission.

The Contractor shall research and write all speeches and talking points necessary for the CMHS Center Director and other CMHS officials as needed. Target audiences shall include culturally and geographically diverse individuals with mental disorders, family members, providers, educators, the media, professional organizations, policymakers and advocates, Federal, State and Local agencies. The Contractor shall produce all slides, charts and graphs as needed to accompany these speeches and presentations.

The Directors speaking schedule is extensive and is supported by CMHS staff and by an external speechwriter.  The speechwriter must have a nearly unique set of qualifications and characteristics.  First, the speechwriter must be thoroughly familiar with all of CMHS policies and programs, as well as be cognizant of how HHS and Administration policies affect CMHS.  Second, the speechwriter must learn and employ the voice of the Director  writing in a style which is particular to the individual who will ultimately deliver the speech.  Third, the speechwriter must tailor each presentation to the particular audience being addressed.  This latter requires knowing in advance whether the audience is professional service providers, state and/or local officials and policy makers, consumers of recovery services, the general public, or a combination of one or more of the above.  The speech writer must also tailor the words to be spoken to the size of the audience, the location, and whether or not audio visual materials will be used as part of the overall presentation.  The speechwriter is also responsible for the preparation and delivery of these materials.  

The Contractor shall be required to perform the following activities: prepare and edit for content and substance, speeches for the Director of the Center and senior staff on mental health related issues. Emphasis is on structure, content, and cohesive articulation of the issues. Bullets on the event, including the topic of the speech and audience makeup will be provided to the contractor by Office of the Director generally 30 days in advance of the event. Contractor will have 7 days to provide first draft of speech to the Director if contractor is writing speech in its entirety. Second and final drafts will be provided back to Director within 24 hours after receiving edits. When the task consists of editing rather than a full speech, the Office of the Director will provide the draft to the contractor generally 14 days in advance of the event. The contractor will have 5 days to provide the Director the completed speech. The Office of the Director will provide background material, including identification of the type of audience. Contractor shall produce a finished product tailored to reach the specific audience with clarity. The speech will contain a clear, coherent, and compelling message designed to capture and maintain the audiences attention. All drafts and final product will be double-spaced and provided in both electronic format and hardcopy (two copies). The period of performance for the resulting service agreement is twelve months.

Baseline: Contractor shall plan to provide 33 speeches/writing assignments per year.
A.  Meet with Project Officer (PO) to discuss project timetable, deliverables, scope and scale of work to be completed. (1-4 weeks from start of contract)

B. Contractor to produce and submit draft document at least (3) three weeks prior to the event date.

C. The Project Officer will have the document reviewed and will submit any changes to the writer within (1) week of receiving the draft.

D.  Contractor to produce and submit final document within 24 hours of receiving edits. Once a final product has been received and accepted by the PO, the contractor may bill for the service.

AHP is uniquely qualified for this procurement based on expertise in and in-depth knowledge of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) particularly with regard to program and policy issues, statistical analyses, budget and appropriations processes, and legislative matters.  

AHP exclusively employs an accomplished senior writer/editor with more than 30 years of experience, who for the past 20 years has researched, written, and edited documents about homelessness and mental and substance use disorders.  This particular staff member is the primary author of SAMHSAs Blueprint for Change to end chronic homelessness and of SAMHSAs Federal Action Agenda in response to the final report of the Presidents New Freedom Commission on Mental Health; helped draft SAMHSAs Report to Congress on co-occurring disorders and a guidebook for the CMHS GAINS TAPA Center on Jail Diversion called Practical Advice on Jail Diversion; serves as the principal speechwriter for the CMHS Director and is helping the agency develop a strategic forecast.

<DESC>FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT  Ivy M. Scott at Ivy m. scottfouche@us.army.mil with a copy to Felicia.D.Johnson1@us.army.mil<BR>  <BR>DESC     REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Requests For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations for a performance-based acquisition strategy that focuses on supply-chain management in support of the BETSS-C spare parts.  A future solicitation/contract would provide performance-based driven support and management services for CECOM managed BETSS-C spare parts located worldwide.  This is not a Requests For Proposals (RFP), or an Invitations For Bids (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from interested parties, to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.  <BR><BR>BACKGROUND: <BR>RDISS Description: RDISS is a fixed surveillance system that can be quickly installed with minimal training and provide the warfighter situational awareness in those activities immediately outside protective barriers.  RDISS consist of two Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras with IR illumination capability and eight fixed cameras monitored from a dual-processor workstation.  Fixed cameras have IR sensitivity for high-quality images at night and video capability of 45 frames per second at 640 X 480 resolution.  The PTZ camera provides 18x optical zoom, continuous auto zoom, 60m active IR illuminator and 360-degree continuous rotation.  The workstation supports 24-hour continuous recording with video files that can be saved and stored for later analysis.  A single Soldier can monitor 10 or more cameras at one location.<BR>FPS Description: The system includes PTZ cameras, the EOSS 250TC integrated thermal imaging system, an AN/PPS-5C Man-Portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), and Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS) Unattended Ground Sensors UGS to detect enemy activity. All of these sensors are connected to the Tactical Automated Security System for command and control.  However, spare parts for MSTAR and BAIS will not be covered under this RFI. <BR>Cerberus Description: Cerberus consists of a trailer-mounted tower with multiple detection and assessment systems, all self-contained on a single mobile platform. Cerberus uses three detection sensorsground surveillance radar (GSR), video motion detection on staring cameras, and optional UGS. Cerberus has two system configurations (standard- and long-range) to provide the Warfighter the flexibility to adjust to a variety of terrains, threats, and missions. <BR>Multiple towers can be netted for control and annunciation to a Common Operating Picture (COP). Networking multiple towers allows an operator to observe the entire perimeter through an easily understood display.  The alarm and assessment data are presented automatically on the display through data overlays and pop-up windows. <BR>Regardless of system configuration, all variants are integrated onto a MIL-STD Generator Trailer that is HMMWV towable and sling-load-certified. Each self-contained system uses MIL-STD HMMWV battery power and an on-board MIL-STD 3.0 KW diesel generator (or commercial line power) to automatically recharge the batteries.<BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: Currently, all spare parts of the above systems will be included in this RFI (Bill of Materials will be provided upon request).  All spare parts are consumable items and are currently maintained by Forward Support Representatives (FSR) in theater.  The intent of the RFI is to provide a forum to identify opportunities to provide a performance-based approach for the acquisition of these spare parts.  An approach that focuses on supply-chain management, requisition wait time, sustainment readiness; and sustainment costs without adding a strain to the Warfighter.  The strategy must also provide visibility to the CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC).  Management of suppliers and spare parts within the BETSS-C supply-chain (including forecasting, stock, store, issue and transportation) will be addressed.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at a future date, another notice will be published. <BR>Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.  If the proposed acquisition strategy utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  The proposed acquisition strategy may consider, but it is not required, the use of FAR 51.000 for the use of DLA as a source of supply.    <BR><BR>RESPONSES: Response will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this performance-based effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry day.  The second step will be participation in the question and answer session at the Industry Day.  The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 20 calendar days after Industry day.  Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font. Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space.  Tables, drawings and header/footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  For tables and drawings, landscape orientation is permitted.  Microsoft Office Professional 2000 and PowerPoint 2000 or later shall be used to create the files.  All graphics shall be compatible with MS PowerPoint 2000.  If any of the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Responses should include, but are not limited to the following:<BR>(A)	Company History: A one page history to include previous major products and primary customer base.  Additionally, RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Governments consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for supply support, field support, and other services including handling of the classified information up to SECRET.<BR>(B)	Acquisition Strategy:  Propose an acquisition strategy explaining how the spare parts supply chain would be managed.  The strategy should include, but is not limited to, forecasting methods (including ramp-up and draw-down in response to surge requirements), locations to stock, store, issue parts, potential partnerships (commercial and government), and transportation methods (for CONUS and OCONUS).  Also, include any foreseen constraints and/or issues that may arise with a performance-based acquisition strategy.  <BR>(C)	Metrics: Propose methods to create and maintain a metrics database for monitoring the performance of the contract.  Discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive based contract award and propose a reporting method that ensures transparency and accountability.  <BR>(D)	Supply Chain Management Knowledge and Experience: Express any knowledge of the identified BETSS-C systems that would demonstrate a technical/logistics capability to support the supply-chain management of the spare parts.  Demonstrate extensive experience and successful track record in sustainment and supply chain management services both for individual systems and within a systems of systems or family of systems framework such as BETSS-C. Also, demonstrate experience and knowledge with providing supply chain services with a quantity of varying individual components or products comparable to BETSS-C (reference BETSS-C Bill of Materials). <BR>(E)	Interoperability: Propose a method that ensures the interoperability of provided spares covered under this RFI with the original and change management strategies necessitated by possible modifications in future configurations.  Focus on the maintaining system reliability and compatibility and demonstrated knowledge and experience in configuration control, specifically in regard to sparing and supply chain management.  <BR>(F)	Cost: Vendor should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost of its recommended performance-based acquisition strategy.<BR>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: RFI responses shall be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after Industry day to US Army CECOM LCMC, IEW&S Directorate, Attention: Ivy M. Scott, AMSEL-LC-IEW-R-SN, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.  Also submit via electronic mail to Ivy m. scottfouche@us.army.mil with a copy to Felicia.D.Johnson1@us.army.mil.  <BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by an industry response to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Propriety will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.<BR><BR>EMAIL ADDRESS Ivy m.scottfouche@us.army.mil

This system must have the capability to deliver real-time data to a monitoring station via a Radio Frequency (RF) path, the monitoring station must have the capability to store, retrieve and forward any date received to higher and adjacent commands via organic communications systems.  The requirement's estimated minimum and maximum ordering units are a minimum of five (5) and maximum thirty-five (35) systems to be used at Infantry ! and Reconnaissance Battalions respectively. All acquired systems will be delivered to continental United States government sites for system content/operation testing before being shipped via United States Marine Corps (USMC) conveyance for ultimate use in Iraq and/or Afghanistan.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  The Government is likely to allow contractor teaming arrangements in any solicitation expected to result from this synopsis. A contractor teaming arrangement is when the offeror submitting a proposal will significantly depend on the products, capital contributions or expertise [in whole, or in part] of another company(or companies) to successfully complete the terms of any contract that may result from the solicitation. If, after reading the requirements listed in this synopsis, a company cannot meet all of the requirements at this time, you are highly encouraged to: 1) register your firm on the interested vendors list for this solicitation at this www.fbo.gov website, and 2) submit a capabilities package to the DeCA contracting office describing the work your company is capable of providing, even if your firm cannot at this time meet all of the requirements exactly as stated below.

This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation or additional information available at this time. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small business HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN, or SMALL DISADVANTAGED sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to each of the thirty (36) Area 5 military commissary store locations assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

DeCAs military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCAs commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns who qualify as HUB Zone (certified or non-certified), Service Disabled Veteran, and Small Disadvantaged Businesses who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to 36 military commissary stores geographically located in the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Puerto Rico.  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from all the commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCAs existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractors own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.  The contractor will be required to deliver FF&V destined for Puerto Rico to the Government's designated export location.  

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Distribution is a key factor in a successful FF&V program. A successful distribution system relies on two main factors, a large volume of product movement and a sufficient number of well-placed distribution centers. When these two factors are present, customers will receive the freshest products available.  Each consolidation and/or distribution center utilized by the contractor in performance of the resulting contract shall have multiple temperature-controlled areas in order to meet the different recommended temperature requirements for the various products in order to maintain shelf life and ensure the FF&V received at each location is of the freshest and highest quality. The lead-time from order placement to product receipt at the store level for CONUS locations (Continental USA) will not exceed 24 hours, and will not exceed 48 hours for order placement in Puerto Rico.

USDA INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall work with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to ensure that all products are inspected, received, stored, staged, and shipped in accordance with USDA standards.  

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall provide additional support and promotions to each commissary store in Area 5.  Additional support includes point of sale material, recipe cards, pamphlets, coupons, seasonal dcor, and/or other material that is often available from produce commissions.  Additional support also includes value added services that are designed to enhance the overall produce program and increase customer satisfaction through a well-merchandised produce department.  Further, additional support includes weekly merchandising visits to each commissary store location, and periodic merchandising support during promotions, resets, and/or grand opening events that provide show-stopping merchandising techniques and SUPER sale priced items.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:

Interested sources are required to respond to this sources sought synopsis by submitting a capabilities package to the contracting office NOT LATER THAN FRIDAY, MAY 22, 2009.  The capabilities package should include:
(1)  Business Size:  HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) SERVICE, DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS, and SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has a requirement  to perform an Organizational Alignment (OA) study to determine options for DESC to implement an Alternative Fuels/Renewable Energy (AF/RE) Office/focus in support of ongoing and newly emerging AF/RE mission requirements.  In addition to the OA for the AF/RE Office, phase II will be performed to review/assess the current DESC organizational structure to determine the best alignment to meet current/future requirements.  The OA is to be utilizing the following phased approach:  

Phase I will provide a recommended office structure that supports meeting alternative fuels and renewable energy requirements for DESC in the short-term.  

Phase II will address options pertaining to how DESC will align itself organizationally to support current and emerging energy related mission requirements as well as determine the best organization fit for supporting DESCs planned migration into the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) scheduled FY 2112.

New mission requirements will require DESC to perform an enterprise-wide organizational alignment (to include the DESC Region Offices) to determine where gaps and seams exist between current organization capability and the future requirements.  This requirement must be developed in accordance with the DLA One Book Guidance for Enterprise Organizational Alignment (EOA). These techniques will include, but not be limited to, eliminating obsolete practices; consolidating functions or activities; reengineering and restructuring organizations, functions, or activities; and adopting industry best business practices.

DESC invites expressions of interest from offerors in writing by May 12, 2009.

At the time, PPMI focused on a series ofcourses to provide a baseline of knowledge for NASA Project Managers who staffed thelong-duration programs and projects characteristic of NASA prior to 1992.  As NASAevolved, the process of project management required a greater level of formal knowledgefor mission success.  PPMI then had to provide more than a baseline of knowledge andneeded to support the wide variety of Program and Project Management (PPM) competencies. Due to the increased scope of the program, the PPMI was renamed the Academy of Programand Project Leadership (APPL) in 1997.	In parallel with APPL, the agency conductedtraining and development activities for engineering practitioners.  This was accomplishedthrough the NASA Engineering Training (NET) Program, whose role was to provideengineering training and tools to assist and enable NASA employees to perform theirresponsibilities.  In 2005, APPL and NET were combined and renamed NASA APPEL.APPEL is a research-based organization that serves the PPM and Engineering practitionercommunities. It supports NASAs mission and governance by promoting individual, team, andorganizational excellence in program/project management and engineering through theapplication of learning strategies, methods, models, and tools at the executive level andprogram/project system, subsystem and element level.

<SUBJECT>Automate an Enterprise Services Catalog
<SOLNBR>ch3388
<RESPDATE>052009
<CONTACT>Donna M Hutzelman, Contract Specialist, Phone 5093752214, Fax 5093726444, Email donna.hutzelman@pnl.gov
<DESC><p><strong>Sources Sought</strong></p>
<p>PNNL is looking for a low maintenance solution to easily automate an Enterprise Services Catalog in order to provide a centralized front-end to a well-defined set of services with clear service levels, pricing and support services requests.</p>
<p>Description<br />Utilizing the Wikipedia definition a service catalog (or catalogue), as defined in ITIL Service Delivery, is a list of services that an organization provides, often to its employees or customers. Each service within the catalog typically includes:</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the service <br />&bull; Timeframes or service level agreement for fulfilling the service <br />&bull; Who is entitled to request/view the service <br />&bull; Costs (if any) <br />&bull; How to fulfill the service</p>
<p><strong>A User's Perspective</strong><br />A user goes to a website to search for a specific service, such as a requesting a new laptop, requesting a change in benefits, or adding a new employee to a department. The service catalog site groups services by category and allows for searching (especially when hundreds or thousands of services are available). The user selects a desired service and sees the description and details. The user enters any pertinent information (contact information, service-specific questions) and submits the request for service. The request requires approval, and goes through routing, service-level management, and other processes necessary to fulfill the request. The user may return to the site later to check on the status of a request, or to view overall metrics on how well the organization is performing the services it provides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Required Features</strong><br />&bull; groups services by category<br />&bull; allows for searching (especially when hundreds or thousands of services are available)<br />&bull; select a desired service and sees the description and details<br />&bull; enters any pertinent information (contact information, service-specific questions) and submits the request for service</p>
<p><strong>Desired Features</strong><br />&bull; approvals and routing - service-level management, and other processes necessary to fulfill the request<br />&bull; allows user to check on the status of a request<br />&bull; provides view of overall metrics on how well the organization is performing the services it provide</p>
<p><strong>Summary<br /></strong>PNNL desires a solution which is clear to the user, easy to maintain, and simple to automate including automation via integration with our enterprise building blocks. The goal is to achieve an easy way to build, duplicate, maintain, and control services by leveraging tools, processes, and mechanisms that reduce the effort in the creation and maintenance of each service. The service catalog concept must be extended beyond typical IT services to include other services offered by each of the functional support areas.</p>
<p><strong>User Stories</strong><br />The following user stories provide insight into how an Enterprise Service Catalog would be implemented at PNNL.</p>
<p><strong>General<br /></strong>1. As an employee I would like to provide the necessary information to have a logon account for a server setup <br />2. As an employee I would like to set up a video meeting.<br />3. As an employee I would like to request access to data so that I don't have to chase down people in order to complete my reports.<br />4. As an employee I would like to have the temperature changed in my office.<br />5. As an employee I would like to order software.<br />6. As an employee I would like to see the status of services requested so that I can review all of my pending requests and see where they are in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Research Staff<br /></strong>7. As a research employee I would like to request equipment be calibrated each month to prevent my research from being interrupted.<br />8. As a research employee I would like to request access to a restricted lab.</p>
<p><br /><strong>System Administrator</strong><br />9. As a system administrator I would like to reorganize how services appear in the catalog.<br />10. As a system administrator I would like to upgrade the system.</p>
<p><strong>Managers<br /></strong>11. As a facilities manager I would like to arrange for construction of a new building.<br />12. As a manager I would like to have the office door re-keyed. (restricted visibility to this request)<br />13. As a facilities manager I would like to have trees removed or trimmed.</p>
<p><strong>Service Provider</strong><br />14. As a service provider I would like to provide a new service via the catalog.<br />15. As a service provider I would like to integrate with existing role based access control system for my new service.<br />16. As a service provider I would like to integrate with existing routing and approval system for my new service.<br />17. As a service provider I would like to collect data from the requestor and pass it on via web service to my existing business system.<br />18. As a service provider I would like to limit access to particular services to prevent foreign nationals from requesting access for other foreign nationals.<br />19. As a service provider I would like to stop providing a service.<br />20. As a service provider I would like to modify how a service is provided.<br />21. As a service provider I would like to override the standard service workflow and route for additional approval.<br />22. As a service provider I would like to override the standard service workflow and reassign the work.</p>
<p><strong>Example Services</strong><br />Examples include but are not limited to the following types of services. These are not limited to just IT services, but rather include business office, facilities, communications and other business units.<br />&bull; Access Requests<br />o Access Control Enterprise System<br />o Badge Request<br />o Classified Visit Request<br />o Clearance Request<br />o Data Access Request<br />o Foreign National Visits and Assignment Request<br />o Identity and Account Management<br />&bull; Business Services<br />o Advance Travel Request<br />o Cell Phone Request System<br />o Request For Foreign Travel<br />&bull; Facility Services<br />o Electronic Craft Turndown System<br />o Facilities Electronic Service Request<br />o Move Request System<br />&bull; Collaboration Services<br />o Instant Messaging Account Request<br />o Live Meeting Accounts<br />o Streaming Video Services<br />&bull; IT Services<br />o Configuration Management Board Request<br />o Help Desk Service Request<br />o Information Technology Review Board<br />o Managed Hardware Program<br />o Managed Software Program<br />o Request for site/share<br />o Risk Assessment Sensitivity Determination<br />o Software Change Request<br />o Web Site Hosting Request<br />o Workstation Backup and Restore<br />&bull; Other Services<br />o Chemical Request System<br />o Duplicating Requests<br />o Electronic Records and Information Capture Architecture<br />o Radiological Control Technician Scheduling</p>

<DESC><p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide:</p>
<p>The environmental SEM (ESEM) along with the focused ion beam capability functionally includes computer-controlled ion-beam micromachining based on a liquid-metal ion source and high-resolution SEM imaging based on a field-emission-gun (FEG) electron source in various gas environments. Full functionality is required for automated sample sectioning with access to electron beam, ion beam, stage positioning (patterning) and gas injector control. The instrument shall be configured to perform these operations either simultaneously or independently, attended or unattended, at the operator's will. Typically, the electron and ion beams shall be integrated in one chamber to achieve this.</p>
<p>ESEM/FIB scanning microscopes specifically designed to study wet, oil bearing, or insulating materials. Polymers, biological cells, plants, soil bacteria, concrete, wood, asphalt and liquid suspensions have been observed in the ESEM without prior specimen preparation or carbon, gold coating. Samples may be examined in water vapor or other gasses such as CO2 or N2 at near atmospheric pressures due to the unique vacuum system of the ESEM. Dynamic experiments should be able to be performed with the ESEM in wet mode with the heating capabilities up to at least 1500 degree C. The studies should be able to be conducted in pressures up to 5-10 Torr with various gases including air, O2, H2, NO, CO, CO2, etc.</p>
<p>The system shall be fitted with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDXS), wavelength dispersive spectrometer and EBSD Camera and software which are similar to Oxford Synergy 350 Premium and EBSD Software or EDAX and 3D OIM software system. This system shall possess the following mandatory specifications. Incorporation of this system with the FIB/SEM instrument is a must with the EDXS software should be able to generate phase maps and quant maps following the elemental mapping of a specific material (arbitrary line scans). The software should allow post-data collection re-processing and analysis of the spectral image data. Elemental maps should have the ability to be colored, as specified by the user, and software should be able to generate maps based on the raw data, net intensities, or background subtracted semi-quantitative data.</p>
<p>Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:</p>
<p>1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.</p>
<p>2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please provide your expression of interest to the attention of the points of contact listed above.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional information, they must also be submitted in writing to the points of contact.</p>

<DESC>High-Payload, One-Side Expandable, ISO Compliant, CSC Certified Shipping Container<BR><BR><BR>Product Manager, Sets, Kits, Outfits, and Tools (PM-SKOT), a component of the U.S. Army Tank, Armament, and Automotive Command (TACOM) is seeking suppliers for a high-payload, one-side expandable, ISO compliant, CSC certified shipping container in two configurations.  The detailed requirements of these containers are described below. <BR><BR>1. General Requirements.  The proposed containers shall be similar in design and function to the current Army Standard Family of expandable shipping containers; construction is not limited to aluminum.  The containers shall be sized to ISO specification 668 for an 8 x 8 x 20 shipping container when fully secured and prepared for transport.  The containers shall meet the full requirements of the most recent version of the Container Stacking Convention for surface transport on container ships.  The walls and roof of the expanding section shall be rigid and weather tight; they shall not be formed of any natural or synthetic textile.  The containers must have an integrated flat-rack loading fixture for use with the M1120 HEMMT Load Handling System (LHS).  The container must have a maximum tare weight of 9000 pounds and a payload rating of not less than 12,500 pounds.  The containers must have fixtures or mechanisms to enable leveling on un-even ground.  The containers shall require 2 persons not more than 90 minutes to level and expand.  Powered or power-assisted expansion is encouraged, but not required; no waiver of the 9000 pound tare weight can be granted for powered or power-assisted expansion mechanisms.  The containers shall be suitable for use in all phases of military transport including ground (including but not limited to travel on primary and secondary roads, unimproved trails, and cross-country travel, as well as washboard, and cobblestone surfaces), rail, CH-47 helicopter, C-130 aircraft, and surface container ship<BR><BR>2. Type I.  <BR><BR>2.1 Reinforced Floor Sections and Interior Bulkheads. The container will be required to support and retain several pieces of industrial machinery.  Each container shall, at the end opposite the LHS bail-hook in the non-expanding section only, have a reinforced floor capable of supporting a 4100 pound load.  This reinforced floor section shall extend not less than 65 inches from the interior wall along the long axis of the container.  For reference, this section of floor will support a metal lathe very similar in size and construction to the Haas model TL-1 toolroom lathe (lathe footprint is 83L x 55W).<BR><BR>At the end nearest the LHS bail-hook, the floor will be required to support an MEP-805 30kW Tactical Quiet Generator (genset).  The empty weight of the genset, with winterization kit, is 2946 pounds; its nominal dimensions are 79.7 L x 35.7W x 55H.  The genset will be mounted in such a way that it can be moved out the side of the container through a hatch made for that purpose.  Provisions for fueling the genset and venting exhaust fumes must also be included.  The genset area shall be completely segregated from the rest of the container by an insulated bulkhead.  No access through the bulkhead is required.<BR><BR>The remainder of the floor may be constructed of materials similar to the Army Standard Family of expandable shelters.  The remaining floor construction shall not inhibit the installation of light-duty anchors or other fixtures.<BR><BR>2.2 Doors and Hatches.  All doors and hatches must be weather-tight.  All doors and hatches shall include provisions for locking using U.S. Army approved padlocks.<BR><BR>In addition to the generator access hatch from paragraph 2.1, the container shall have the following:<BR>(2) maximum-height entry doors, no less than 6 feet in width.  These doors may be one or more sections, so long as the 6 width is maintained.  These doors shall open to the outside and shall be located along the long sides of the container, one in the expanding section and one in the non-expanding section.<BR>(1) lathe maintenance hatch, no less than 4.5 feet tall and span the entire width of the container, not including the corner posts.  This hatch shall be located in the end of the container opposite the LHS bail-hook and shall be hinged to open upward and will have a mechanism to hold it open.<BR><BR>Other hatches.  There will be other hatches in the design.  Their exact locations and sizes are not known at this stage of design; however, they will be significantly smaller than the doors and hatches listed above.  The container construction shall not require unreasonable technical knowledge or significant re-design to accommodate the addition of hatches.<BR><BR>2.3 Roof and Floor Load limits.  In the non-reinforced portion of the main section, the shelter floor shall support an evenly distributed load of not less than 100 pounds per square foot.  The expandable section floor shall support an evenly distributed load of not less than 2000 pounds.  The roof of the main section shall support a uniform load of not less than 75 pounds per square foot.  The expandable section roof shall support a uniform load of not less than 40 pounds per square foot.<BR><BR>2.4 Operational Temperature Ranges.  The container shall be suitable for operation in temperatures between -40F to 125F and storage in temperatures between -65F to 160F.  The container shall be insulated to provide a heat-transfer coefficient of 0.35 or better.<BR><BR>2.5 Service Life.  The container shall be designed to provide an anticipated service life of not less than 15 years in service or 20 years in storage.<BR><BR>3. Type II.  <BR><BR>The Type II container shall be exactly the same as the Type I container except that the interior bulkhead, the genset access hatch and the floor reinforcement for the genset shall be omitted.<BR><BR>4. Existing Designs and Production Feasibility<BR><BR>It is requested that contractors provide information on containers they currently have or indicate they could build such containers.  Information requested may be in the forms of product literature, spec sheets, illustrations, and simple written responses.  In addition, contractors are requested to provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) as to the expected cost for which this shelter design would involve.  Costs are only requested to assist the government in its preparation of budgets.<BR>

This will be a requirements type contract with one (1) base year and one (1) option year.  This will be other full and open competition using OEM Carrier    equipment; Keep Right and MSA equipment only.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Carrier, Keep Rite and MSA are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEMs.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition as they are available from this source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the equipment for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves equipment being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer and/or its actual suppliers or authorized dealers.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussion such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the equipment for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  It is the Governments belief that only Carrier, Keep Rite and MSA, the manufacturers of the equipment and/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required equipment to ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.

<a href="mailto:michael.barnes8@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>VA-797-08-RI-0115 Amendment 0001PAPS- Response to vendors' comments- KEY TO COLORSRED is VA original documentBLUE is contractors commentsBLACK is Contracting Officers answerGREEN is Integrated Product Team (IPT) answerThe VA is seeking comments from Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) vendors.  Please send comments, questions and concerns on the information and specifications listed below.DO NOT SEND QUOTES, OR SAMPLES-This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, NOT A SOLICITATION.B.2 SCOPE OF CONTRACT and STATEMENT OF WORK1.0 INTRODUCTION1.1 Background.  The Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Prosthetic Clinical Management Program (PCMP) Integrated Product Team has identified Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Devices as a uniform preferred product for potential consolidated contracting.  PAP devices are issued through local prosthetic activity.1.2 Purpose and Objectives.  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain user uniformity, and quality products at competitive prices.  The objectives are to standardize PAP devices to ensure that all veterans are receiving comparable treatment across the nation, and to consolidate VA requirements to achieve better pricing.What are the stipulations for this? The stipulations of this make it seem like a BPA.How is it different than a BPA?A BPA is not a contract, it is an agreement.  A BPA would require a vendor to have the particular offered products on FSS contract.  This contract will not require the vendor to have the offered products on FSS contract.Is the contract guaranteed for just one vendor, or can multiple companies receive thiscontract?There will be one contract awarded.Is this contract truly a "Sole Source" contract or just a mechanism to truly "formalize"the procurement process?There will be one contract award made to the successful offeror.  One award does not mean Sole Source.  FAR definition- Sole source acquisition means a contract for the purchase of supplies or services that is entered into or proposed to be entered into by an agency after soliciting and negotiating with only one source.1.3 Contract Duration.  The base contract period is for one year, with two one year option periods that may be exercised by the Government.These terms are fine. To get better pricing from manufacturers, we would prefer that itbe a two year contract with two one-year options. However, we understand that keepingit at one year gives the V.A. the ability not to renew or to competitively bid it out again.The one year base with two one year options was determined to be in the Government's best interest.1.4 Contract Effective Date.  The effective date of the contract shall be 45 days (or sooner upon mutual agreement) after the award date.1.5 Product Samples and Demonstration.  This solicitation requires that all contractors submit product samples before or by solicitation due date. Any samples received after solicitation closes will not be evaluated and offer will be considered non responsive. The exact makes and models of product listed in offers shall be submitted to be evaluated.  Information regarding the demonstration is set forth in the "PROPOSAL ORGANIZATION" section that follows clause FAR 52-212-1, "INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS" and in FAR 52-212-2 "EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, which are included elsewhere in this solicitation.We like this idea. This clause will give an advantage to vendors (like ourselves) whoprovide higher quality product(s) which meet the specifications in the table below.Requiring samples is the standard procedure for VA standardization programs.2.0 EXTENT OF OBLIGATION2.1 Government Participants. The contractor shall provide the products specified in the contract directly to VAMCs throughout the United States and Puerto Rico at the prices awarded herein and under the terms and conditions set forth in the contract upon receipt of a delivery order/purchase order signed by a person with purchasing authority on behalf of a VAMC.  Individual VAMCs shall issue delivery/purchase orders to the contractor which shall indicate the specific items ordered, item quantities, and all necessary delivery and payment procedures.  2.2 Estimated Quantities.  See Schedule of Supplies for estimates by line item.  There is no expressed or implied guarantee that the estimated quantities will be purchased under this contract.  Actual quantities may exceed or be less than those represented.  What is your current estimation as to what the total volume would be annually in unitssold? The annual estimated quantities for each line item will be on the RFP (Request For Proposal)..2.3 Report of Sales. Successful offerors shall be required to provide a Report of Sales to the Department of Veterans Affairs National Acquisition Center on a quarterly basis as required by the Contractor's Report of Sales clause contained in this solicitation.Will the "Report of Sales" be on [Form 72] like it currently is? Or is there anothermechanism for reporting?The Report of Sales will be made on an electronic template.  The template will be provided to the awardee.Will electronic report be acceptable?Electronic is the preferred method of sales reporting.Is there/Will there be an "Internal Funding Fee" of some kind, similar to the .05% that iscurrently in place?Yes, there will be a .05% CRF (Cost Recovery Fee).  The CRF is to be included into the vendors offered pricing.  The instructions will be in the RFP.3.0 Delivery 3.1 Ordering/Delivery Requirements.  The successful contractor(s) should be capable of receiving orders from the Medical Centers via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), if the contractor has this capability, or via facsimile.  Delivery shall be made to any VAMC within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, and Puerto Rico upon issuance of a delivery order.  Delivery shall be in accordance with the following time frames:  Regular delivery shall be made within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a delivery order, expedited delivery within 3 days, and emergency delivery within 24 hours.  The Government agrees to pay the difference between normal/regular and expedited freight for expedited and emergency delivery.  4.0 Technology Refresh.A.  All devices offered shall be state-of-the-art technology.  "State-of-the-art" is defined as the most recently designed components that are announced for marketing purposes, available, maintained and supported in accordance with requirements specified in the solicitation.  Components and products with a manufacturer's planned obsolescence within the first year of contract award are not acceptable.  B.  If upgrades become available after award of this contract, the contractor will substitute them for the awarded items per paragraph C below.C.  The contractor will provide to the contracting officer the following information:(1) A list of specific awarded items that shall be updated.(2) Product literature for the new items and a detailed description of the differences between the awarded items and the new items, and a specific analysis of the comparative advantages/ disadvantages of the items involved.	D.  The Contracting Officer will provide the information to the IPT for approval.  Upon approval, the contract will be modified to acknowledge the updated items.What is "IPT"?IPT is Integrated Product Team.  This is a team of VA deemed subject matter experts that write the specifications, evaluate the samples, and work on other aspects of standardization programs.E.  All new technology must support all units purchased under the awarded contracts for a period of three years.We like this clause. This will cause all contractors to abide by all updated CMS and FDAstandards for the respective equipment.The clause ensures that the VA PAP machines will not be quickly obsolete.B.3 SPECIFICATIONS Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Machine.  The following specifications are required.  Failure of the product literature or product samples to show that the offered items conform to the required specifications will require rejection of the offer.  If the offered items are rejected, they will not receive further evaluation.	 1	PAP machine must have selectable pressure between an inclusive lower pressure of 5 and an inclusive upper pressure of 20 cmH2O in increments of 1 cm or less.An additional clause should be that "pressure can only be adjusted by clinician". The VAMC should prohibit machines with "manualpressure changes" (which are in many lower quality and oldermodels). Machines with pressure that can be manipulated by patients compromise clinical care as the standard is for patients to decrease air pressure level for their personal comfort.What is the thought process behind the VA wanting to have a selectable and inclusive lower pressure of 5?Can a machine that is submitted for the RFP have a selectable pressure at an inclusive lower pressure starting below 5?1. THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD THAT THE PRESSURE CAN ONLY BE ADJUSTED BY A CLINICIAN. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE MANUFACTUERER TO SUBMIT AND OFFER.2. MACHINES CAN HAVE PRESSURES LOWER THAN 5. MACHINES, HOWEVER, MUST BE ABLE TO HAVE A LOWER PRESSURE AS LOW AS 5	 2	Airflow must keep the mask pressurized with a positive pressure needed to maintain airway patency.	 3	Machine must be able to use standard size tubing.  Length 6-12 feet, diameter 22 mm with a female connector compatible with standard PAP machines, PAP masks, and humidifiers (if humidifier is not built in).Does the sited length of 6-12 feet represent the required lengths of tubing the device must able to accommodate? Or is it rather the range of length of tubing the unit can accommodate - anywhere from 6 feet to 12 feet.1. THE MACHINE MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE TUBING RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 6-12 FEET.	 4	Machines must include tubing and have a carrying case that accommodates the machine, interface, tubing, and humidifier (if appropriate).	 5	Machines must have ramp capability.  "Ramp" is a feature that allows positive pressure to gradually increase over time (maximum pressure increments 2cm H2O, total ramp time must be adjustable between 0 and 15 minutes or more.	 6	Machine must accept and work properly with mask interfaces from at least three different manufacturers.The amendment which states that, CPAP machine "must accept and work properly with mask interfaces from at least three manufacturers." One could surmise, rightly or wrongly, that this amendment was written to not only protect the incumbent, but to eliminate the incumbent's competition. Since there are only a limited amount of companies in America that manufacture these products, one could interpret the clause as being written to make sure that any CPAP machine would be compatible with the products made by the incumbent.This is required so that we do not have to use proprietary masks for a particular machine. At least some masks (or nasal pillows) from other manufacturers must be usable with the machine. We do not want to get locked into only using their patient interface.Having received other similar comments on protecting "the incumbent" please note that there are currently 5 contractors with PAP equipment BPAs:Jordan Reses Supply Company     VA797-BP-0064Dimensions Medical Supply Group (DMSG)  VA797-BP-0068Medical Place, Inc.      VA797-BP-0088Vaughn Medical           VA797-BP-0103 Sunrise Medical HHG dba DeVilbiss VA797-BP-0138 	 7	When operating and producing 10cm H2O pressures, noise must be below 40 dB.The noise level threshold of 40 dB is fairly high. We would recommend lowering this to 30 dB's to produce a quiet sleep environment.1. THE MANUFACTURER CAN MAKE A MACHINE THAT HAS 0 DB AND THAT WOULD BE GOOD. OUR SPEC IS 40 AT 10CM. THERE IS NO NEED TO CHANGE THIS SPEC; WE ARE NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE MANUFACTURER.	 8	Machine must store a minimum of 90 days of "time on mask" machine usage data downloadable using a memory-card, flash-disk, or direct connection.  If system requires a reader, up to six will be provided with software to each facility that issues PAP machines at no additional expense.  Software will either be unlicensed or nationally licensed and updates to software will be provided free of charge for the duration of the contract.We would ask that you in include "visual indication" to the description of machine usage data.  We recommend the first sentence to read "Machine must store a minimum of 90 days of "time on mask" machine usage data downloadable using a memory-card, flash-disk, direct connection or visual indication of encrypted code."  Our device enables you to read a code off the display screen, enter it into a decryption tool via a pc and generate while-breathing usage data.  In addition, we have an on-board Adherence Score which objectively reports the percentage of compliance as per the newly published CPAP LCD. By adding this option to the specifications it would allow yet another convenient method to monitor usage and trouble-shoot therapy. I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE THIS REQUIREMENT. 	 9	PAP machine (without humidifier) must weigh 7 pounds, or less.Love this clause. It will require that only the newer generation devices be put on the list. This will be great for the patients.OK. I'M GLAD YOU LOVE IT	10	Machine must use either washable or disposable filters and accept optional pollen, ultra-fine, or hepa filters. 	11	Machine must operate on 115 VAC, RMS 60 Hz, comply with electrical safety standards for biomedical equipment, be FDA approved, and meet all government standards by appropriate laboratories such as UL, ASTM, and CSA.	12	Machine, or any ancillary electrical equipment used with the machine (e.g. heated humidifier) that needs to be plugged into 115 VAC, RMS 60 Hz, must have double insulated, 2 prong AC plugs for home use.	13	Machine must include 2 year warranty including parts and labor.  For warranty repairs contractor is responsible for freight to and from the medical center or patient's home.Love this clause. It will require that only manufacturers with highquality warranties are offered.THAT WAS THE POINT	14	Machine must have or accept humidifier that can be used in heated or unheated mode.  When the PAP machine is used with humidification, it will be compatible with a variety of breathing circuits.  The vendor must submit a list of compatible breathing circuits."When PAP machine is used with humidification, it will be compatible with a variety of breathing circuits."  Please define breathing circuits.BREATHING CIRCUITS ARE PATIENT INTERFACES (MASK, NASAL PILLOWS ETC) AND TUBING AND HEADGEARBiPAP ONLY	15	Inspiratory and expiratory pressures must be independently adjustable.The reference is BiPAP only.  BiPAP is a single manufacturer's trademarked name, the generic term is Bi-level.WE SHOULD USE BILEVEL PAP (BPAP) IN THE SPEC, IF WE SAID BIPAP, IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.APAP ONLY	16	The high and low pressure range boundaries must be independently settable.	17	Machine auto-adjustment must not be based solely on snoring or vibration. We would recommend that the machine adjust based on at least 2 out of 3 criteria: snore, flow limitation and apnea.THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION. BUT NO, KEEP IT THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN.	18	In addition to "time on mask", the machine must provide delivered pressure levels, pressure x time analysis, and mask leak data.  Summarized data must be provided 4 weeks, or more, and full disclosure data for 3 nights, or more.Like the current BPA categories, this makes it seem like you are segregating the PAP products into the 3 current categories of CPAP, APAP and BiPAP.CORRECT - CPAP; BI-LEVEL & APAPB.4 GLOSSARYThe following set of definitions is offered to clarify some of the terminology used in this document. These definitions are not meant to be standard definitions of usage but rather are offered here for guidance and elucidation of what is meant within the context of this specification. Usage (adherence/compliance) data: Specific information about how much a patient is using the positive airway pressure device. The usage data for these machines must provide day-by-day statistics for hours (or clock times) of use, determined by time-on-mask. A minimum of 30 days must be either stored or be available by other means.We would like to challenge the definition of Usage (adherence/compliance) data:  "day-by-day" data may be overwhelming to collect, manage and review.  Compliance and an improvement in condition can be satisfied via a data set collected over a period of time. In addition statistics by hours may also be redundant and difficult manage and review. We would ask that you change this definition to read "Specific information about how much a patient is using the positive airway pressure device.  The usage data for these machines must be objective and provide while-breathing usage statistics, determined by time-on-mask. A minimum of 30 days must be either store or be available by other means.DAY-BY-DAY DATA ARE NOT OVERWHELMING TO COLLECT, MANAGE, AND REVIEW. WE DO IT ON EVERY CLINIC FOLLOWUP VISIT. KEEP AS IS.Downloadable usage data: This is when usage data are transferred to a personal computer system either by direct connection via a port (serial, parallel, or USB) or with a memory device on which data are written and can be read by the computer using a reader or port physical device handler.We would like to challenge the definition of Downloadable usage data: as described above our machines will generate an encrypted code which is displayed on the CPAP display.  The code is obtained from the IntelliPAP by the patient and relayed to the provider who can then decipher to code and generate a comprehensive compliance report via a pc.  This system works much like a barcode.  We would ask that the definition be changed to read "This is when usage data are transferred to a personal computer system either by visually indicated encrypted code, direct connection via a port (serial, parallel, or USB), with a memory device on which data are written and can be read by the computer using a reader or port physical device handler.THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS ADDITION. THIS IS ONE MANUFACTURER'S FEATURE, NOT A GENERAL REQUIREMENT OR DEFINITION.Usage data full disclosure: Usage data full disclosure refers to detailed daily information about usage, pressure and leaks, with temporal resolution to 0.1 hours.Ramp: Ramp is a feature that allows positive pressure to gradually increase to the set pressure over time in order to presumably improve patient comfort.Time-on-mask: The amount of time the patient is actually using the positive pressure machine. Time-on-mask is determined by sensing a backpressure and/or pressure oscillations indicating that the mask is in place and the patient is breathing.Memory-card, flash-disk, or direct connection: This represents several techniques available to transfer usage data from a positive pressure machine to a personal computer. Memory-cards, "smart-cards", memory devices that emulate disk drives, direct wire connection to a computer port, or a wireless connection to a computer port are included.Built-in or Integrated humidification: This refers to systems in which the humidifier is part of the PAP machine, is part of a system in which the PAP machine and humidifier connect on an integrated platform, or when the humidifier is designed to attach to a specific PAP machine.  Respiratory events: Respiratory events include apneas and hypopneas. Flow limitations and oxyhemoglobin desaturations may also be included52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999)(a) The Government shall award one contract, from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   The Government shall evaluate the proposed devices to determine whether they meet the minimum specifications as described in the Schedule of Supplies and Specifications.  The Government shall make this determination on the basis of information obtained from the offeror, such as descriptive literature and product samples.  Failure of any offered items to conform to the specifications and definitions will require rejection of the offer.  Offers from distributors/dealers must contain a letter of commitment from the manufacturer. The letter must be on manufacturer letterhead, signed by person with authority to commit manufacturer to supply product to VA and the manufacturer contact information. Any offers from distributors/dealers that do not contain a letter of commitment adhering to the above mentioned requirement will be rejected.These are the same terms as that to currently get new product onto the price list. ThisShouldn't be a problem.The VA wants to ensure that this letter of commitment is signed by an authorized manufacturer representative that has authority to commit the manufacturer.  It is a standard requirement for distributors to provide a manufacturer letter of commitment.This clause will also prevent contractors who don't have a LOC (Letter of Commitment)from buying third-party to sell to the VAMC.Distributors/dealers that do not submit a valid manufacturer's letter of commitment will have their offers rejected.We agree that Offers must hold and submit a letter of commitment from the manufacturers.  As part of that letter, the issuer of that letter must include contact information for the signee to be verified by the solicitor.    We would recommend that the commitment letter be current reflecting the manufacturer's intent for this solicitationManufacturer letters of commitment must state that they will provide the distributor with the products listed on the solicitation for the contract duration.The RFI states that one contract will be awarded for PAP equipment.  Does this mean a single contractor will supply all categories of CPAPS, APAPS, and BIPAPS equipment?Yes a single award will be made covering all line items all categories.How many awards will be made?  In the document it references one contract but it also states throughout the document language such as "successful offerors" and successful contractor(s), implying more than one.   Does this mean that there will be an award in each category and possibly to different vendors in each?One award will be made to cover all categories all line items.  There will not be awards made for categories or line items.  The VA intends to have one contractor provide all of the required products. Will correct language that suggests multiple awards.The VA should not consider a procurement strategy wherein only one vendor is selected to provide the products and services envisioned by this contract. The best procurement method for the VA would involve having multiple awardees. The GAP BPA has proved that multiple vendors provide an invaluable benefit to the VA by giving them a choice of vendors and choosing the one with best service and the best price. The GAP BPA not only works in such a matter, but it also provided the VA with the ability to choose among competing vendors for cost savings and better service. From what we have seen of the draft solicitation, however, including its recent amendments, we are very concerned that VA might be intending to go back down that dark road of "one vendor takes all." If so, it would be a costly mistake for the agency.VA acquisition strategy is not developed by determining what is in the best interest of a contractor.  VA strategy is determined by what is in the best interest of the Government.Once a preliminary determination has been made that all of the offered line items meet the specifications, the following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance will be applied:1)  Technical Evaluation - Technical evaluation factors consist of Patient-relevant factors, Clinician-relevant factors, and Machine-relevant factors.  The three factors are listed in descending order of importance.  These three factors are listed below with their significant subfactors.Patient-Relevant Factors:  The subfactors are listed in descending order of importance.1. Ease of assembly/disassembly (for routine cleaning & maintenance, not repair)2. Ease of operation for patient3. Mechanism to reduce pressure spike when patient begins exhalation**For clarification, can you please reference the ISO 17510 CPAP Standard in this item of the solicitation. The standard requires a measurement of CPAP pressure swings and will ensure that this requirement will be met by all manufactures who submit a bid.Machine-Relevant Factors "Mechanism to reduce pressure spike when the patient begins exhalation", Can you define further?  Is this a pressure relief mechanism?**1- ISO 17510 STANDARD IS BEING REVIEWED. THIS QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED AND POSTED AS SOON AS THE REVIEW HAS BEEN COMPLETED.2- THIS IS A PRESSURE RELIEF MECHANISM.4. Clarity and "user-friendliness" of operators manual supplied to patientClinician Relevant Factors:  The subfactors are listed in descending order of importance.1. Ease of programming by clinician2. Ease of accessing utilization (adherence) data3. Accessibility of technical support and quality of serviceMachine-Relevant Factors:  The subfactors are listed in descending order of importance, with the second and third being of equal importance. 1. Overall integration of machine and its accessories (e.g. humidifier).2. Length of time for which usage (adherence) data is available3. Total size of footprint4. Length of warranty (indicate percent longer than specification)5. Measurement of respiratory events which may include mask leakAre standard, non auto-adjusting, CPAP units required to provide measurement of respiratory events?THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED BUT IT WOULD ADD VALUE FOR THE CLINICIAN EVALUATION FACTOR6. Automatic altitude adjustment2.  Price.  Price will be evaluated by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Offers that do not include a price for all line items (1a thru 3i) will not be considered.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).Would it be possible to obtain a copy of all line items (1a-3i) referenced?  We would like to understand how configured products will be bid.The 1a thru 3i mentioned above under Price was inadvertently left in this RFI.  The actual line items will be listed on the RFP with estimated quantities for each line item.This is great. We believe that price/value is something that isn't totally being consideredright now of all the items in the A-46 category.We cannot speak to any particular SIN (e.g. Special Item Number A-46) categories, but the VA is aware that there is more to value than just price.3.  Quality/Past Performance.  The Government shall evaluate the offeror's reputation for quality and past performance.  By quality and past performance the Government means the offeror's reputation for conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's reputation for adherence to contract schedules, including both technical and administrative aspects of performance.  The Government shall evaluate quality/past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the offeror, such as previous commercial and Government contracts.  (See Attachment A).  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.What is unclear is what is meant by "quality"?Webster's defines quality as "degree of excellence".  Quality in this context is tied with Past Performance.  The Government evaluates a contractor's delivery history, customer service, resolution of issues, billing issues, etc.  Is there a metric to determine this?No, but a substantial part of Quality/Past Performance evaluation is based on references that the contractor provides.Our fear is that "quality" is a subjective decision and not an "objectivecalculation"Yes it is subjective decision, but is based on objective information.Our only concern here is "length of time" as an offeror and not simply "quality/pastperformance" be taken into consideration. We do not want to be selected against justbecause we do not have the tenure of some other contractors/offerors.Length of time in business is not the factor.  What a business has done during that length of time is the factor.Past Product Performance -We request a past performance review of previously awarded 'PAP devices in terms of percentage of defects, returns of the equipment, and replacement of defective or return equipment. Past Contractor Performance -We request a past performance review of previously awarded 'PAP devices contractor in terms of service of contract (i.e. timeliness of shipment, % of incorrect shipments, unauthorized substitution of products, and invoicing).The past performance review encompasses past performance of all aspects of a contractorsperformance, not just on previous PAP devices contracts.  There are contractors that will be making proposals that have not had previous awards on these specific products. 4. Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation (See 52.219-24 and Attachment C)  Evaluation of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation will be a subjective assessment based on the offeror's SDB Participation Targets (expressed as dollars and percentages of the total value of the offer), and the extent to which the SDBs are specifically identified in the offeror's proposal.  This evaluation factor will also take into consideration the complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform under the contract.Small Disadvantaged Business Participation applies to Large and Small business concerns.5. SDVOSB and VOSB must be registered on vetbiz.gov to receive this factor.Will "non-verified" SDVOSB concerns be eligible to submit offers? This is a full and open competition.  Any contractor is eligible to submit a proposal, but the claimed socio-economic status will be verified on vetbiz.gov before award.  Even non verified SDVOSB or VOSB are eligible to submit proposals, but unverified will not receive the SDVOSB or VOSB evaluation factor preference.If your firm is a SDVOSB or VOSB please ensure that your firm is not just self certified on vetbiz.gov but is VA certified on vetbiz.gov.  Check to see that the certified logo is displayed by your company name.We feel that this is an ideal requirement to place under the VA's "Veterans First" Program. The VA would not be sacrificing quality or cost of products by setting this requirement aside for veteran owned businesses.The Veterans First program is the first consideration in developing acquisition strategy.  A set-aside requires the Buy American Act, which requires the non-manufacturer rule.  The non-manufacturer rule requires non-manufacturers to distribute for a SMALL domestic or outlying area manufacturer.  Market research did not find small domestic manufacturers of all the required PAP devices.The non-price factor of Technical is significantly more important than price.Quality/Past Performance and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation when combined are significantly less important when compared to price.  Price is significantly more important than SDVOSB & VOSB status.  All evaluation factors other than price, with the exception of SDVOSB & VOSB status when combined, are significantly more important than price.We know that items 1-5 from above are in descending order of importance. Is thereactually a formula or weighted average where you can tell us what each category is"worth" in your calculation of an overall score for a respective vendor.There is an actual weighted formula.  This is proprietary information.Can you further clarify the last paragraph of the draft dealing with the significance of factors such as technical, price etc. in the award process?  It would be beneficial to be more specific as to the degree of importance each factor has with the factor being most important listed as #1 with factors listed in decreasing order of importance.The factors listed above are in descending order of importance. See VA answer above in RED discussing the specific degree of importance.How many responses have you received from 8a, Hub Zone, WO, SDB, SDVOSB and VOSB concerns? The number of responses is proprietary information.Will PL 109-461, CFR 38.125, VA IL 049-07-08 and other veteran's friendly contracting procedures be utilized to evaluate offers? SDVOSB and VOSB are given an evaluation factor that increases their chance of winning the award, with SDVOSB status being higher than VOSB status.Will VA require SDVOSB concerns to be "verified" before they can submit offers?No.  The verification of claimed SDVOSB status will be determined after receipt of proposals.  Will SDVOSB and VOSB offers be evaluated equally or will other criteria be used?SDVOSB status receives more preference than VOSB status.Will the SDB category be omitted from the evaluation criteria?There is not a SDB category.  There is a SDB Participation factor which applies to both large and small businesses (see 4 above).How will the contracting priority for SDVOSB and VOSB concerns be determined under Sec 8128, 109-461 guidelines?The veterans first under 109-461 was the VA first consideration.  This procurement was determined to be a full and open competition with concurrence from OSDBU (Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization) and the SBA (Small Business Administration).We feel that this is an ideal requirement to place under the VA's "Veterans First" Program. The VA would not be sacrificing quality or cost of products by setting this requirement aside for veteran owned businesses.Answered above.If there are 2 or more responsible SDVOSB concerns, will you consider a SDVOSB concern set-aside?No.  This is a full and open competition under FAR part 12 and 15.  A SDVOSB set-aside is under FAR part 19 and requires the non-manufacturer rule which requires the contractor to provide either its own product or that of another domestic (or outlying area) small business manufacturing or processing concern.If there is only 1 responsible SDVOSB offer, will you consider a SDVOSB concern sole-source award?No.  The contract will be awarded to the winning proposal regardless of the contractor socio-economic status.  Sole source award means a contract for the purchase of supplies or services that is entered into or proposed to be entered into by an agency after soliciting and negotiating with only one source.What is your rationale for not awarding a separate contract for each category of equipment?This procurement is for VA standardization of PAP devices.  One requirements contract for all PAP devices ensures standardization, and one PAP products source is what our VHA customers required.Why do SDB concerns rank higher in order of importance than a SDVOSB concern under the evaluation factors?SDB concerns do not rank higher than SDVOSB or VOSB concerns.The factor is SDB Participation, not SDB concerns.  Any proposals that utilize SDB Participation (see 4 above) receive this evaluation factor.  The VA encourages all proposals from large or small businesses to achieve this factor.This acquisition represents a gateway for VA to increase procurement opportunities for veterans. I encourage you to consider the use of restricted competition (set-aside) procedures pursuant to 38 U.S.C 8127 for this requirement provided you obtain 2 or more responsible SDVOSB concerns who submit offers.A SDVOSB set-aside was considered first, but market research dictated a full and open competition.  A SDVOSB set-aside is under FAR part 19 and requires the non-manufacturer rule which requires the contractor to provide either its own product or that of another domestic (or outlying area) small business manufacturing or processing concern. Market research did not find small domestic manufacturers of all the required PAP devices. OSDBU (Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization) and the SBA (Small Business Administration) concurred with the decision of full and open competition.  OTHER CONTRACTOR COMMENTSTAA Compliant -Awarded 'PAP device manufacturer should be required to manufacture interface masks, component accessories and replacement parts in a designated country in accordance with the Trade Agreement Act. The interface masks, component accessories and replacement parts are necessary products and are supplied in conjunction with the 'PAP device and should be required to abide by the Trade Agreement Act.All products required on contracts that are designated for full and open competition must be TAA (Trade Agreement Act) compliant. Masks and component accessories are not part of this contract. National contracts can only dictate TAA compliance on products that are to be covered by the contract and not open market items.

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Command and Control System - Consolidate (CCS-C) Program Office intends to modify the existing CCS-C contract, F04701-01-C-0012, to add two 12-month sustainment option CLINs, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2). If exercised, the sustainment CLINs will extend the current contract up to two years with periods of performance from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 and 1 January 2012 through 31 December 2012.<br />The modification for continued CCS-C sustainment support will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Integral Systems Inc., 5000 Philadelphia Way Lanham MD 20706-4419.
<p>The system sustainment effort includes organizational level hardware, software, and database maintenance; depot level hardware maintenance through either extended hardware warranties or purchase of support to repair failed hardware components; depot level software maintenance for approximately 600,000 source lines of custom and reuse code; depot level database and command procedure maintenance; software integration and test; and software installation and configuration management.</p>
<p>A two-year extension to the current CCS-C contract is the only viable option to avoid a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in meeting mission requirements. No qualified interested parties exist or can exist outside of ISI to maintain the ISI MILSATCOM CCS-C system as will be required by CCS-C Block II unless sufficient CCS-C program documentation and plans are generated and made available to potential offerors. Due in part to the acquisition environment when the current contract was let, the Government did not envision a need for reprocurement data and did not purchase it. It is anticipated no less than two years is required to allow time to generate and obtain sufficient CCS-C program design, development and sustainment documentation. Upon receipt of this system documentation it will be provided to potential offerors to enable a source selection for the longer term Block II contract. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for a competitive CCS-C Block II contract is expected to be released in the 1st Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012.</p>

<SUBJECT>Development of Software Coupling Tools for Efficient and Effective MULTI-MATERIAL Design and Integration Demonstration Propulsor
<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-09-33
<RESPDATE>060409
<ARCHDATE>06052009
<CONTACT>CAPT DUANE ASHTON, Email DARPA-SN-09-33@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-33: Development of Software Coupling Tools for Efficient and Effective MULTI-MATERIAL Design and Integration Demonstration Propulsor;<br />Request for Information; SUBMISSION DEADLINE: June 4th, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: CAPT Duane Ashton, DARPA/DSO, Email: DARPA-SN-09-33@darpa.mil</p>
<p>DARPA has an interest in developing engineering tools and approaches for the DoD community to take advantage of MULTI-MATERIAL engineering solutions across a wide range of applications. DARPA's overarching goal is to develop and utilize a coupled, multi-physics, computational engineering tool-set within applicable programs to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of those programs. This tool-set involves military aircraft and ship design and analysis efforts for DoD land, sea, air, and space platforms. This RFI pertains specifically to the computational coupling of existing special-purpose codes and algorithms for optimized structural and hydro-acoustic design of US Naval Propulsors.</p>
<p>Propulsors are an integral part of a ship system and its operational capabilities. They perform critical functions and are currently designed using proprietary special-purpose computational codes and algorithms that must simultaneously address multiple demanding maritime operational environment requirements. The current uncoupled nature of the existing design and analysis tool-set has been identified as an impediment to shortening the design cycle and also to rapidly and accurately assess off-design maneuvers. The design of propulsor systems is increasingly more challenging as they have become more complex, heavy, and hard to maintain in order to cost-effectively counter increasing advanced threats. Significant improvements in the US Government propulsor analysis capabilities are needed to field high-performing, lighter weight, and easily maintained systems. The US Government plans a phased cycle for the tool-set development. The coupled tool-set operational requirements will be validated and tested at the beginning of every development cycle by DoD stakeholders.</p>
<p>The vision is to develop and transition coupled structural and hydro-acoustic tools based on the existing uncoupled special-purpose, open-source, and commercial codes to support rapid MULTI-MATERIAL designs and integration into various structures of the DoD interest, including air, sea, land, and space-based platforms. The validated tool-set must be extensible and fully documented, and all source-code must be provided and controlled using modern software tools such as svn or git. It is envisioned that the software will be developed and distributed using a collaborative DoD service such as FORGE.MIL (www.disa.mil/forge). Finally, the US Government plans not only to lead this project, but also to participate in the development and testing of the various components of the tool-set.</p>
<p>This current Request For Information (RFI) and applicable sources is to identify companies and organizations that are capable of coupling the various existing codes, determining the relative merits of the various approaches, and participating in the implementation of the coupling efforts. Examples of existing codes include implicit and explicit finite element analysis (FEA), Steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS), Unsteady RANS, Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), Lagrangian bubble dynamics, acoustic boundary element methods (BEM), and models for various acoustic forcing functions, among others.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that approaches to be considered will include, as dictated by the physics, either partitioned or fully-coupled methods. Examples of the former include MpCCI (the Mesh-based parallel Code Coupling Interface), a code-coupling interface from the Fraunhofer SCAI in Germany, and the Simulia Direct Coupling Interface (DCI), which provides a tighter integration between ABAQUS and certain third-party CFD solvers. It is also anticipated that open-source libraries, utilities, and solvers will be leveraged wherever possible. (e.g., OpenFOAM, PETSc, Overture), and that Mesh generation and CAD modeling will be tightly integrated in the final solution. A US Government organization will conduct independent verification and validation of the tool-set development across the phases.</p>

<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-35: Physical intelligence (PI);<br />Proposers' Day Workshop, DATES: June 9th and June 11th, 2009; <br />REGISTRATION DEADLINE: May 29, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Todd Hylton, DARPA/DSO, Email: Todd.Hylton@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm
<p>In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Physical intelligence (PI), DARPA is hosting two Proposers' Day Workshops that will provide critical information on the program vision, the milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The Physical Intelligence program aspires to understand intelligence as a physical phenomenon and to make the first demonstration of the principle in electronic and chemical systems. A central tenet is that intelligence spontaneously evolves as a consequence of thermodynamics in open systems. The program plan is organized around three interrelated task areas: (1) creating a theory (a mathematical formalism) and validating it in natural and engineered systems; (2) building the first human-engineered systems that display physical intelligence in the form of abiotic, self-organizing electronic and chemical systems; and (3) developing analytical tools to support the design and understanding of physically intelligent systems. If successful, the program would launch a revolution of understanding across many fields of human endeavor, demonstrate the first intelligence engineered from first principles, create new classes of electronic, computational, and chemical systems, and create tools to engineer intelligent systems that match the problem/environment in which they will exist. Concepts relevant to the objectives of the Physical Intelligence program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including statistical physics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative systems, group theory, collective behavior, complexity theory, consciousness theory, non-linear dynamical systems, complex adaptive systems, systems analysis, multi-scale modeling, control systems, information theory, computation theory, topology, electronics, evolutionary computation, cellular automata, artificial life, origin of life, microbiology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary chemistry, neuropsychology, neurophysiology, brain modeling, organizational behavior, operations research and others.</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host two similar PI Proposers' Day Workshops, one on each coast of the United States. The workshop goals are to: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the PI program vision and goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort; and (c) promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the PI program goals. The workshops will include overview presentations by Government personnel and poster sessions to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas described in the forthcoming BAA will be critical to the success of the PI program. DARPA will not be funding partial efforts that address only a subset of the goals listed in the PI solicitation. Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session. Additionally, a teaming website has been established to facilitate these interactions at http://www.sainc.com/PITeaming.</p>
<p>There is no fee for the PI Proposers' Day Workshops. Registration for each workshop is limited (maximum 100 people; 2 persons per organization) by the venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended. The Poster Session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 40 posters total. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, May 29, 2009. Organizations wishing to register more than 2 participants, bring more that one poster, or attend both workshops should request to do so by e-mail to Dr. Hylton as early as possible (expect replies during the week of May 25, 2009).</p>
<p>Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>East Coast Workshop<br />Time: June 9, 2009, 7:00am-5:00pm<br />Location: Hyatt Regency Reston<br />1800 Presidents Street<br />Reston, VA 20190<br />Registration website: www.sa-meetings.com/PIEast<br />(Password = pieast).</p>

U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION:   Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for (Product Service Code (PSC) 9130  Liquid Propellants  Petroleum Base.
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for PSC 9130  Liquid Propellants  Petroleum Base.   According to a request, no small business manufacturers supply these classes of products to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified nonmanufacturer to supply the products of any manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or participants in the SBAs 8(a) Business Development Program.  DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].  ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Pamela M. McClam, Program Analyst, Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Ms. Pamela M. McClam, by telephone at (202) 205-7408; by FAX at (202) 481-4783, or by email at Pamela.mcclam@sba.gov
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), and SBAs implementing regulations provide that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or participants in the SBAs 8(a) Business Development Program must provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.   13 CFR  121.406(b),125.15(c).   Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market. 
      In order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.  13 CFR  121.1202(1).   The SBA defines "class of products" based on a six digit coding system.  The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  In addition, SBA uses product service codes to identify particular products within the NAICS code to which a waiver would apply.
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule under NAICS code 324110, for Petroleum Refineries,  PSC 9130  Liquid Propellants  Petroleum Base.
      The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of products within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.

<a href="mailto:helene.s.mitchell@sam.usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The contractor will:  1) De-water, clean, inspect, and repair locks at Coffeeville, Selden, and Bankhead Locks, and 2) De-water, clean, inspect repair, and paint spillway gates at Coffeeville, Holt, and Bankhead Dams.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  The modification will also incorporate contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

<DESC>This is sole source procurement for an emergency interim contract under the: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1) and Unusual and compelling urgency (Far 6.302-2). The associated NACIS code is 621610. The West Palm Beach Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center (WPB VAMC) intends to award an interim contract as a sole source contract for 90 days with one (180 days) option to extend to Gentiva Health Services to avoid interruption in patient care and a severe backlog of services until a new contract solicitation is issued and new contract award to one or more possible bidders is awarded. WPB VAMC has a need for continuity of Skilled Home Health Services in accordance with Health Care Resources Contracting-Buying Title 38 U.S.C., as outlined on VA Directive 1663. WPB VAMC is currently providing care to eligible and entitled veterans requiring approximately 1,900 Skilled Nursing Home care visits and 131 Physical Therapy visits per quarter. Skilled Nursing Care Services is provided to our patients in the community who require continued medical attention, but are not at the level of needing inpatient treatment. The current contractor, Gentiva Home Health Services is able to supply the staff and resources required for the completion of the required services. The WPB VAMC and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (COBC) do not have sufficient staffing to handle the present and growing volume of patients needing the required services. The contractor provides the needed staffing, scheduling and supervision to handle the extra load. Gentiva staff have completed the required background security checks, signed a BAA as well as any all statue security requirements. Gentiva is found to be the only source that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements, should monitor this website for an announcement that will be posted within 90 days requesting competitive bids for these services. Written responses will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete this interim contract based on responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.The Points of contacts for this requirement are Adalberto Afanador at (Adalberto.Afanador@VA.Gov) or Yamil Rodriguez at (Yamil.Rodriguez@VA.Gov).

Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract.

CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Franklin County, Missouri, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,213 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4,739 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by August 1, 2009. The delineated area is bounded on the North by Independence Drive to Williams Road to West Park Road; on the West by Independence Drive to Main St to Old Highway 50; on the South by Highway 50; and on the East by Highway 47 to Rock Road to Highway V to Independence Drive. Other applicable requirements include:

- Forty (40) surface parking spaces with ample space for trucks with trailers 
- Specific information technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  Anyone interested should call Sheria Yancey at (636) 583-2303.  Final date to inquire about the advertisement is May 29, 2009.

Statement of Work
2/10/09
1	Introduction
1.1	Background
Air National Guard bases around the country are home to high dollar assets such as fighter and cargo aircraft.  Due to the current defense budget, the Air National Guard has insufficient funding to adequately guard these aircraft.  Radar and camera systems have been installed at some facilities in an attempt to multiply the force to better secure these assets.  Unfortunately, radars and cameras are insufficient to completely guard most bases.  Blind spots such as hills, valleys, trees and buildings create vulnerabilities in the defenses that can be exploited by terrorists.

To plug these holes an Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) system is required.  The selected system must detect personnel and vehicles, have a naturally low false alarm rate, be self forming and self healing, be easy to use, be easy to integrate with radar and camera systems and must have low maintenance costs.
1.2	Purpose
The Air National Guard desires to integrate such a UGS system into one of its bases to test the viability of such a system in helping protect its flight line assets.  In particular the purpose is to install a system that will provide surveillance of rugged terrain that is difficult to observe with radar or cameras.  If successful, this system could form the template for protecting all bases across the country.
2	General Requirements
2.1	Program Management
The contractor shall perform administrative, technical, and financial management functions during the course of this effort and shall maintain a status of their effort towards achieving the objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, problems/deficiencies, impacts, and recommended solutions.  Documented management processes and practices will be utilized to perform the program work.

<SUBJECT>Biospecimen Contributing Institutions for Research Studies in Cancer Tissue Pre-Analytical Variables 
<SOLNBR>S09-148
<RESPDATE>061809
<CONTACT>Victoria Barron, Sr. Subcontract Specialist, Phone 301-846-5825, Fax 301-228-4037, Email barronvl@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The purpose of this procurement is to subcontract with hospital centers, hereafter referred to as the BRN Biospecimen Contributing Institution (BCI), to collect, process, and annotate post-surgically removed tissue and blood biospecimens under defined protocols. The BCI will be the first component of a larger multi-center overall plan for biospecimen research as described below.
<p>Further, the goal of this research is to systematically analyze the effects of biospecimen pre-analytical variables on molecular analysis. To this end, up to 1200 case-matched tumor and 1200 control samples per subcontract year will be analyzed to achieve a statistically significant dataset for each cancer type in the project. It is anticipated that several hospital centers will be subcontracted over a 5 year period to each produce up to 300 case-matched tumor and 300 control samples per subcontract year. SAIC-Frederick (SAIC-F) will engage with clinical sites capable of meeting the case accrual rates, along with specific protocol, data, and biospecimen requirements of the project. The subcontract(s) that results from this procurement will be designated as a BCI. The collection, processing, storage, and shipment of biospecimens obtained for analysis in the intended research project must be performed under well-documented and rigorously quality-controlled procedures. Intra-operative variables must be well documented and post-operative pre-analytical variables must be thoroughly controlled. Biospecimens must be extensively annotated with regard to acquisition and processing variables, beginning with intra-operative and post-operative variables. Electronic histologic images must be provided for the purposes of pathology verification.</p>
<p>The hospital subcontractors must ensure that only the highest quality biospecimens are obtained. It is important to note that "high quality" refers not only to biological quality of the samples (i.e., histological and molecular integrity) but also to the related clinical annotation and the status of ethical and legal documents associated with the samples (i.e., institutional review board [IRB] protocol review, appropriateness of the informed consent process, and presence or availability of material transfer agreements [MTAs]), the quality of the associated data (i.e., the extent of donor clinical and biospecimen annotation), and the degree of process documentation (e.g., sample handling and storage protocol detail, QA and QC). It is essential to this research that any variation in molecular analysis data be traceable to the handling variables or intrinsic biologic differences between biospecimens, rather than to undocumented variations in biospecimen handling protocols or other technical/operator differences. <br />In actual execution, the work performed under this subcontract will resemble a complex clinical trial with all the appurtenant human subjects protection, study and cohort management, and data collection issues, layered on top of stringent workflow and laboratory protocols required for the collection of biospecimens of high biological quality. Subcontracted BCIswill be expected to view this statement of work as a clinical trial in which the purpose of the protocol is to collect and process biospecimens under defined experimental conditions.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-09-T-0113 applies and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a firm fixed price contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to National Instruments Corporation (NIC). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This acquisition is for test and measurement!  equipment to replace the Intermediate Scale Measurement System (ISMS) model acquisition system at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD), Bayview, ID. This equipment must integrate seamlessly with existing custom acquisition software and with over 560 channels of existing NIC hardware currently utilized at ARD.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32 as well as DCN 20090115. The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334119 with an applicable size standard of 1000 employees. SEE ATTACHED FILE FOR CLAUSES.

If either electronic mail or facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail.

Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (e) of this clause.   

(d) Upon receipt of contractor invoices, FinCen will electronically route invoices to the appropriate TSA Contracting Officers Technical Representative and/or Contracting Officer for review and approval.

Responses that fail to furnish the required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of this solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:   All Offerors shall ensure that their submission includes, at a minimum, the following information in response to this solicitation:
1)	Letterhead  (See FAR 52.212-1 above), 
2)	Reps and Certs (See FAR 52.212-3), 
3)	Technical Narrative and Relevant Supporting Documentation (Volume I) 
4)	Past Performance Information (Volume II), and 
5)	Price for each CLIN (0001  0002b)

TECHNICAL NARRATIVE AND RELEVANT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:   The Offeror shall submit a narrative explaining how the proposed product meets or exceeds the stated minimum requirements of this solicitation.  The Offeror shall also submit supporting documentation which may include but is not limited to manufacturers product information, specifications, laboratory test results, environmental fact sheets, graphic representations of proposed products, etc.   The narrative description shall address, but is not limited to the following aspects of their proposed product for evaluation purposes: 
	Availability 

PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:     Past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Governments confidence in the Offerors ability to successfully deliver the product proposed. 

Offerors shall provide a list of not more than five (5) projects/contracts/orders where the offeror has successfully contracted for similar requirements in the past two (2) years. These projects/contracts/orders can include those performed for the federal, state, and local governments, commercial industry and those performed for private organizations.  For each project/ contract/order that meets this description, the offeror shall provide the following information:
1.       Customer Name (agency, bureau, private organization, etc.)
2.       Customers Address
3.       Project/Contract/ Order number
4.       Period of performance of Project/Contract/Order
5.       Point of Contact for Project/Contract/Order
6.       Point of Contacts address, Telephone Number, and email address
7.       Quantities of the products delivered       

	It is the offerors responsibility to ensure that all past performance information is accurate, current, and complete.  The information provided by the Offeror may not serve as the sole basis of evaluation of past performance. The Government reserves the right to obtain and utilize information from sources other than those identified by the Offeror.  

PRICE FOR EACH CLIN (0001  0002B):  Offerors shall provide total firm fixed price per unit for each CLIN. Prices quoted shall be FOB destination and must reflect the total cost to the Government.  The Government shall conduct its price analysis using one or more of the techniques specified in FAR 15.404-1(b) in an effort to determine price reasonableness.

The factors importances are listed in descending order (from the most important to least important):

1. Technical Narrative & Support Documentation
2. Past Performance 
3. Price Information

Price is less important than any non-cost factor. However, if ratings among the other factors are similar (i.e. multiple offerors receiving the same rating for the technical criteria) then price will increase in its importance as a factor. Cost/price may become the determinative factor in the final source selection decision when making the best value trade-off determination. 

SOURCE SELECTION:  The Government intends to award a competitive Blanket Purchase Agreement to the Contractor whose proposal, conforming to the combined/synopsis, represents the best value solution using a Trade-Off analysis. The Best Value Approach is a method of selecting the proposal that presents the best value to the Government, based on evaluation of each offer in the areas of Technical Narrative, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) may determine that a superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The SSA, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposals relative capability.

The Government may: 
(1) Reject any or all submittals if such action is in the public interest; 
(2) Accept other than the lowest price submittal; and, 
(3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 

Proposals that do not respond to all requirements in the solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be significantly not compliant with the solicitation requirements, unrealistically high or low in price, or reflects a failure to comprehend the requirement. 

The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors. If the government determines that discussions are necessary, the government reserves the right to establish a competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306(c). The government reserves the right to limit the competitive range for efficiency.

<DESC>The NAICS code for this action is 541990.  The SSP is a joint, multi-agency activity sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to meet increased customer demands for signature data. The SSPs overarching goal is to facilitate the access to high-quality signatures to a diverse customer base. To do this, the SSP leverages the full spectrum of signature related activities (initial collection, processing, development, detailed analysis, and production) within the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community (IC), and various other U.S. Government agencies. The program addresses a host of signature types, including, but not limited to, acoustic, biological, chemical, seismic, radio frequency, infrared, radar, nuclear radiation, electro-optical, and biometrics.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense.
Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).  
3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under "business access."  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor's expense.
4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.
7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer. 
8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractor's employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.
9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  
Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror's submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror's.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if ! any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.  
EVALUATION:The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, will be lowest price technically acceptable considering the following factors:  
1) Price2) Technical (Brand Name Only)
The Contractor shall certify that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Channel Partner as of the date of the submission of their offer, and that it has the certification/specialization level required by the Manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable Manufacturer certification/specialization requirements.

This justification is for continuation of previous years services and tags garnered through the same contractor. This would be a Phase 2 implementation, and as DSD is slated to begin with in-scope IT Asset consolidation immediately post the March 15, 2009 DoS reconciliation deadline, we are in an urgent situation and imminent to fall-behind with the IT Consolidation schedule. Thus, the ability to continue with an industry-recognized contractor that has already helped us implement the first phase seems to be the best and most efficient avenue to pursue. Lastly, their quote was vastly less than other competitors we contacted.<BR><BR>

<p>Q:&nbsp; To which items do the service packs listed in the Minimum Specs document apply?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What is an MPIN? Where can I locate or assign my MPIN?</p>
<p>A: A Marketing Partner ID Number (MPIN) is a personal code that allows you to access other government applications such as the Past Performance Automated System (PPIRS) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). The MPIN acts as your password in these other systems, and you should guard it as such. The MPIN is created by the registrant and must have nine characters, containing at least one alpha character (can be entered in upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted.</p>
<p>If you are not registered in CCR and need an MPIN, please view our CCR User's Guide for instructions on what is needed for registration and details on how to register.</p>
<p>If you need individual help in finding your MPIN, you can reach the CCR Helpdesk at 888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757 (DSN: 661-5757) internationally.</p>
<p>The MPIN is a mandatory data element, so every active CCR registration must have an MPIN.</p>
<p>To view your company's MPIN:</p>
<p>Go to the CCR Homepage: www.ccr.gov. <br />Click on "Update or Renew Registration". <br />Select an entity type and then click "Continue". <br />Enter your user ID and password, then click the "Log In" button. <br />Select "Edit" for the DUNS number you are looking for. <br />Click on the "Points of Contact" menu option. <br />Scroll to the bottom of the Points of Contact page to view your MPIN. <br />If you choose to change your MPIN, please keep in mind that it may take 24-48 hours for other government systems to recognize your new MPIN.</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has a requirement  to perform an Organizational Alignment (OA) study to determine options for DESC to implement an Alternative Fuels/Renewable Energy (AF/RE) Office/focus in support of ongoing and newly emerging AF/RE mission requirements.  In addition to the OA for the AF/RE Office, phase II will be performed to review/assess the current DESC organizational structure to determine the best alignment to meet current/future requirements.  The OA is to be utilizing the following phased approach:  

Phase I will provide a recommended office structure that supports meeting alternative fuels and renewable energy requirements for DESC in the short-term.  

Phase II will address options pertaining to how DESC will align itself organizationally to support current and emerging energy related mission requirements as well as determine the best organization fit for supporting DESCs planned migration into the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) scheduled FY 2012.

New mission requirements will require DESC to perform an enterprise-wide organizational alignment (to include the DESC Region Offices) to determine where gaps and seams exist between current organization capability and the future requirements.  This requirement must be developed in accordance with the DLA One Book Guidance for Enterprise Organizational Alignment (EOA). These techniques will include, but not be limited to, eliminating obsolete practices; consolidating functions or activities; reengineering and restructuring organizations, functions, or activities; and adopting industry best business practices.

DESC invites expressions of interest from offerors in writing by May 12, 2009.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site located approximately 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, Idaho. CWI is requesting an expression of interest (EOI) from prospective Vendors or Consortiums to provide equipment and services to perform subsurface grouting of waste located at the INL. This expression of interest shall serve only as a method of establishing technical capabilities and commercial interest.&nbsp;Previous DOE experience is favorable. Evidence of a qualified work force, regularly engaged in the trades required to complete such work, is required. Qualified candidates may be invited to participate in follow-on technical or business discussions which may include on-site visit(s) from CWI technical staff to examine drilling/grouting hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The INL is located in southeastern Idaho and occupies 890 mi<sup>2</sup> on the northeastern region of the Snake River Plain. Within the boundary of the INL, the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) was created in 1952 for the disposal of radioactive waste. Waste was disposed of in pits and trenches. Historically, waste containing radioactive and hazardous substances was managed in accordance with laws and disposal practices current at that time. Present day operations involve the remediation of these sites. The waste targets associated with this EOI are located in the RWMC's Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA). The treatment area comprises up to 20 discrete disposal locations (totaling approximately 0.2 acres) in SDA trenches and soil vault rows. Treatment will be performed via pressure grouting utilizing a preferred cement based grout formulation. The work scope includes furnishing all necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, operating documentation, supplies, and tools to perform all operations necessary to emplace the selected grout. Chemically, and/or radiologically contaminated soil and debris may be encountered during the remedial action activities. The subcontractor will be required to integrate their work with Contractor facility operations and oversight and monitoring organizations (e.g., Safety, Industrial Hygiene, or RadCon personnel monitoring and material sampling, etc.). Work will be performed in compliance with the applicable sections of 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1910, 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1926, and the CWI Subcontract Requirements Manual. Involvement with small business firms is recommended and all work must be performed under the requirements of the Davis Bacon Act. Additional information </span></p>

<DESC><p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - SUBSURFACE GROUT STABILIZATION OF SPECIFIC WASTE TARGETS LOCATED&nbsp;AT THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPLEX AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY </strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site located approximately 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, Idaho. CWI is requesting an expression of interest (EOI) from prospective Vendors or Consortiums to provide equipment and services to perform subsurface grouting of waste located at the INL. This expression of interest shall serve only as a method of establishing technical capabilities and commercial interest.&nbsp;Previous DOE experience is favorable. Evidence of a qualified work force, regularly engaged in the trades required to complete such work, is required. Qualified candidates may be invited to participate in follow-on technical or business discussions which may include on-site visit(s) from CWI technical staff to examine drilling/grouting hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The INL is located in southeastern Idaho and occupies 890 mi<sup>2</sup> on the northeastern region of the Snake River Plain. Within the boundary of the INL, the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) was created in 1952 for the disposal of radioactive waste. Waste was disposed of in pits and trenches. Historically, waste containing radioactive and hazardous substances was managed in accordance with laws and disposal practices current at that time. Present day operations involve the remediation of these sites. The waste targets associated with this EOI are located in the RWMC's Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA). The treatment area comprises up to 20 discrete disposal locations (totaling approximately 0.2 acres) in SDA trenches and soil vault rows. Treatment will be performed via pressure grouting utilizing a preferred cement based grout formulation. The work scope includes furnishing all necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, operating documentation, supplies, and tools to perform all operations necessary to emplace the selected grout. Chemically, and/or radiologically contaminated soil and debris may be encountered during the remedial action activities. The subcontractor will be required to integrate their work with Contractor facility operations and oversight and monitoring organizations (e.g., Safety, Industrial Hygiene, or RadCon personnel monitoring and material sampling, etc.). Work will be performed in compliance with the applicable sections of 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1910, 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1926, and the CWI Subcontract Requirements Manual. Involvement with small business firms is recommended and all work must be performed under the requirements of the Davis Bacon Act. Additional information </span></p>

<CONTACT>Jaime N KrystyniakContract Specialist317-988-1821

<a href="mailto:Jaime.Krystyniak@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions regarding Solicitation No. VA251-09-RP-0105.Q: On page 7, it indicates this CBOC contract has a Base Year and Four (4) Option Years. This has only Three (3) Option Years. Is there consideration for the 4th option year?A: The solicitation is for a base year and three (3) option years.Q: On page 13, it states that Retinal Screening will be performed on patients. Who provides the retinal screening?A: Under the Retinal Screening, it states (Government-furnished equipment and supplies) the camera will be supplied by the VA.Q: On page 13, it indicated that established patients should be seen within 30 days of request. Does this meet VA guidelines for established patients?A: Established patients should be seen within 30 days of request.Q: On page 14, it states that Contractor shall purchase the following: Zostavax, Gardesil, Psychiatric Medications and Toradol. These are normally part of the medications provided by VA pharmacy. Is this a change in policy?A: The Contractor will be responsible for the listed medications.Q: What is the timing for awarding the RFP after proposals are accepted?A: After receipt of proposals, contract award is anticipated to be made on or before July 20, 2009.Q: "The Contractor shall comply with the following contract requirements within 60 calendar days of the Date of Award." While a 60-day start-up period may be appropriate for the transition from an existing CBOC to successor, it is really too short of a start-up period for a new contract like this. We strongly urge VA to consider extending it another 30 days.A: No, there will not be an extension for a start-up period. The start-up period will remain to be 60 calendar days from the date of award.Q: Where are veterans in this area currently being seen? Are they being seen at primary care clinics in Indianapolis? Elsewhere?A: A portion of the veterans are currently being seen at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana and the Bloomington, IN CBOC; the VA cannot predict how many patients will want to transfer to the Martinsville, IN CBOC.Q: If the "expected" population in the primary service area ranges from approximately 16,700 in 2009 to 15,600 in FY 2014, why does VA envision a maximum of 3,000 enrollees in the CBOC? What is the definition of "expected" population, and why is the maximum number of enrollees projected for the CBOC not closer to the expected population?A: The VA has historical information on market penetration. The population of veterans would include many who are Priority 8 and ineligible for care.Q: We understand that the income level for Priority 8 veterans will be increased by 10 percent effective July 01, 2009, thereby increasing the number of veterans eligible for enrollment. Is that correct? Does the "expected population" data include any increases associated with this change? If not, what impact is it expected to have on the CBOC enrollee population?A: The expected population is all veterans in the area. The data would include the raising of the income level. For the entire Indiana market (includes Indianapolis, Marion and Fort Wayne VA) the increase in Priority 8 utilization is only expected to be 1,700 unique veterans and for Indianapolis, the increase in primary care is only 1,996 total stops. Expected impact is minimal.Q: Approximately, how many females are eligible in the catchment area? How many are currently enrolled?A: Historically, of the uniques treated at the Indianapolis VAMC, five (5) percent are female and the CBOC can be expected to be the same.Q: Are any of the counties listed within the catchment area of any other CBOC?A: Yes, there are other CBOCs within the counties listed.Q: Prescriptions are to be filled at a local pharmacy. Is the local pharmacy contractor known at this time? If so, please indicate who and where it is.A: No, the local pharmacy contractor is not known at this time.Q: "If a patient needs a medication(s) immediately and cannot wait to receive the medication through the CMOP, the Martinsville CBOC provider shall issue a prescription for a 10-day supply (or less) to the patient from a pre-approved list of emergency medications, to be filled by a local pharmacy at no expense to the VAMC or the veteran." Who pays for the 10-day or less supply of the prescription, if it is to be at "no expense to the VA or veteran"? We assume this means that the offeror is to build the cost of the 10-day or less emergency fill prescriptions into the capitation rate and that there is to be no "additional cost" to the VAMC or veteranbeyond that already built into the capitation rate. Please confirm.A: Contractor pays for 10-day fills of medication.Q: Has VA initiated any changes with respect to flu vaccines that would affect this contract in light of the swine flu developments?A: No, the VA has not initiated any changes with respect to flu vaccines that would affect this contract in light of the swine flu developments.Q: Are all patients to be seen for mental health services a subset of patients enrolled at the Martinsville CBOC for primary care, or could they be veterans not enrolled in the CBOC?A: There may be some veterans seen in Mental Health that are NOT enrolled at the CBOC, but are enrolled at the Indianapolis VA.Q: "These assignments shall be documented by use of the Primacy Care Management Module (PCMM) or the latest electronic panel assignment module to allow VA to review panel size and workload per PC team. (Reference Primary Care Directive VHA Directive 2003-063, Active Patients in PCMM, October 23, 2003 and VHA Directive 2004-027 Primary Care Direct Patient Care Time)." Does the Indianapolis VAMC consider panel sizes referred to in these directives as requirements or guidelines?A: Panel sizes are guidelines.Q: "Contractor may (emphasis added) be required to provide a care manager who will be trained by the VAMC Indianapolis, to manage the data from multiple chronically ill patients, assess their status and refer to their clinician as needed according to mutually agreed protocols." How is this position to be priced in the proposal, since it is not clear whether it will be required, and if so, at what point? We suggest that VA add a separate CLIN to the pricing schedule for this position with the understanding that the Government may elect to exercise it at some point in the life of the contract.A: This could be duties assigned to the triage RN or full time administrator.Q: How many enrollees are classified as co-managed with community practitioners under the VHA Dual Care Policy?A: Unable to provide a number, as we currently do not have a CBOC in Martinsville.Q: "For patients admitted to a nursing home while enrolled at a CBOC, Contractor shall provide history and physicals required for nursing home admissionVA Community Nursing Home contracts stipulate that nursing homes are responsible for physician coverage during patient's stay in a patient's nursing home. However, Contractor is responsible for providing information promptly to the nursing home regarding the patient's medical history. Contractor shall resume patient care after discharge from nursing home as appropriate." If a CBOC enrollee is admitted to a nursing home, is the patient to be disenrolled as an active primary care patient? With respect to billing, does VA have guidance in regarding treatment of CBOC enrollees who are admitted to a nursing home?A: Patients must have an annual physician to be considered active and Contractor to bill for the patient. If a patient is admitted to a nursing home, they must still have an annual visit to remain on the Active patient roles. Patients are followed by the nursing home physician, but must be seen by the provider at the CBOC annually to receive reimbursement.Q: The minimum staff requirements are as follows: "A full-time administrator (clinic director) specifically identified to administer the day to day business activities of this contract." We believe a full-time administrator for a CBOC with a maximum of 3,000 enrollees is not necessary for a population of that size and request that VA reconsider this requirement. We are capable of providing it, however, we think it will add unnecessarily to the cost, without a commensurate increase in overall benefit for the relatively small population involved.A: VA requires an Administrator be available to administer day-to-day activities. This person is required to provide reports, such as clinical reminders, hire/terminate, resolve patient issues, handle billing (i.e. screening mammogram, 10-day emergent medication fills, handle requests from the COTR, etc.).Q: "The Contractor shall provide physicians who are Board Certified in either Internal Medicine or Family Practice Medicine with at least three (3) years of post graduate training in their board." This statement is then followed by: "The Contractor shall provide physicians who are Board Certified in either Internal Medicine or Family Practice Medicine with at least three (3) years of post graduate training in their board specialty or two (2) years of Emergency Department experience or hospitalist experience within the last five (5) years." Please clarify.A: Emergency Department and Hospitalist will be considered, if meeting the requirements of the VA Credentialing and Privileging office.Q: "There is no evidence supporting an annual physical for well veterans. However, given the acuity of the population, an annual visit during the term of the contract may be required with the care provided at the levels listed below:	Established patient expanded problem focused, detailed, or comprehensive office visit (99213, 99214, 99215)	Periodic preventive visit with comprehensive history and exam (99393, 99396, 99397)".The use of the term "may" is confusing. Is an annual vesting visit of any type required, or not? Please clarify. A: Yes, annual visits are required.Q: If the Indianapolis VAMC has determined that the patient must be seen annually, the qualifying visit must be coded at CPT 99203-99205 for new patients or 99213-99215 for established patients. Medical record documentations must support these CPT codes. If a patient does not have a visit at the level of the qualifying codes he/she will be inactivated at the Martinsville CBOC. No compensation shall be provided for inactivated patients...If the Indianapolis VAMC has determined that an assigned patient should be seen annually and assigned patient had not been seen within the previous 13 months, the patient shall be inactivated at the Martinsville CBOC. No compensation shall be provided for inactivated patients.This paragraph adds to the confusion as to whether the contractor is expected to see every patient at least annually. Under what circumstances would the Indianapolis VA determine that a CBOC enrollee would not have to be seen at least once every12 months? Is the contractor paid a capitation rate for such patients?A: Patients must be seen at least annually for reimbursement.Q: "The Contractor shall ensure that assigned patients are assigned a primary care provider in the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) per VHA Directive 2003-063 Active Patients in PCMM." By "ensure" does that mean that the contractor must ensure that panel size guidelines are not exceeded? A: Panel size is a guideline not a requirement. Panel size can be adjusted as long as capacity does not exceed 3,000 patients and patients are receiving the same standard of care as the VA is providing.Q: C.3  52.216-19  ORDER LIMITATIONS  (OCT 1995)    (a) Minimum order.  When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than 3,000 patients, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract.   (b) Maximum order.  The Contractor is not obligated to honor--     (1) Any order for a single item in excess of 3,000 patients;     (2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of 3,000 patients; or     (3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 365 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.  (End of Clause)NOTE: The minimum and maximum annual contract amounts for each line item for each year of the contract are as follows:"	Contract Line Item Number 1: The minimum amount for each year (base and option years 1, 2, and 3) is 50 patients. The maximum amount for the base year is 1,500 patients, and the maximum amount for option years 1, 2, and 3 is 3,000 patients.	Contract Line Item Number 2: The minimum amount for the base year and option years 1, 2 and 3 is two (2) patients, and the maximum amount for each year of the contract is 50 patientsWe are confused by the language related to minimum and maximum order quantities. Please clarify these inconsistencies.A: The minimum number of patients is less than 50 each year of the contract. The maximum number of patients is not to exceed 1,500 during the base year of the contract. The maximum number of patients is not to exceed 3,000 during Option Years 1, 2 and 3 of the contract.The minimum number of non-enrolled patients is less than two (2) during the base year and option years 1, 2 and 3, and the maximum number of non-enrolled patients is not to exceed 50 patients during each year of the contract.

<DESC><p>General Services Administration&rsquo;s (&ldquo;GSA&rdquo;) Lease No. GS-09B-01529 will expire in August 2009. This lease provides 6,720 rentable square feet yielding approximately 5,600-5,800 ANSI/BOMA Office Area ABOA of office and related space and 19 parking spaces in Temecula, CA. GSA is considering the option of a succeeding lease action for 10 years, 5 years firm, but also interested in alternative Class &ldquo;A&rdquo; space in the same City, with same amount of square footage, parking and length of time, if economically advantageous to the Government. In making this determination, GSA will consider cost factors including but not limited to the total cost of the physical move, (including furniture, telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs, above standard alterations (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and the anticipated rent for the space, as well as other factors impacting the Government&rsquo;s rights under a prospective lease, such as, the length of any firm term that might be required at an alternative location, the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy, the agency mission, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term. Buildings offered must be modern design, substantial construction, in professional well-maintained surroundings, above grade and must be altered to meet the Government&rsquo;s specifications and be fully-serviced. Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation is desired within 5 minute drive. Opportunity for exterior signage is highly desirable. As stated, the proposed lease is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm and will require 19 parking spaces. Space must be ready for occupancy no later than August 1st 2009. The offered space must meet Government requirements for GSA Life and Fire Safety Standards and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABBAS) Requirements. A Pre-Lease Building Security Plan will be required with the offer. All expressions of interest should include the following: (1) building address and floor location; (2) rentable square feet and rate per rentable square feet; (3) BOMA method of measurement, usable yield for all available space by floor, and building common area factor; and (4) 1/8&rdquo; scale drawing of floor plate if available. Please specify services and utilities included. Also, all expressions of interest submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence of authorization to represent the building&rsquo;s ownership. Interested parties should reference project #8CA2758 and submit pertinent information by the close of business on December 30th, 2008, to: Herbert H.

<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Synopsis / Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W9126G-09-R-0069 <br />Posted Date: March 13, 2009<br />Synopsis posted for: 15 days<br />Can post solicitation on: March 30, 2009<br />Current Response Date: April 30, 2009<br /><br />Classification Code: Y --- Construction of Structures and Facilities<br />Set Aside: Unrestricted Pool of Contractors <br />NAICS Code: 236220 --- Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction <br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, ATTN: CESWT-CT (Karen Nelson), 819 Taylor Street Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX 76102 <br /><br />Description <br />All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. This Acquisition shall be competed as UNRESTRICTED. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. An unrestricted solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $370 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Unrestricted within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $100 Thousand. The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<br /><br />There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />For all large businesses proposing under the unrestricted procurement, which requires submission of a subcontracting plan, the Government will require at least 25% of the total dollars that will be awarded to them over the life of the MATOC to be subcontracted. Then, the subcontracting goals set forth in the solicitation and resulting contract will apply to those subcontracted dollars.<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov. Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only. It is the contractors responsibility to check the below-listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation. No corrections and/or changes to proposals will be allowed after the proposal submittal due time and date. <br /><br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about the estimated date of March 30, 2009.
