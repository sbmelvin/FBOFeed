The Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000 authorizes funds for implementation of the Agreement including funds for cooperative research and management projects on the Yukon River in Alaska.

This is a call for initial project proposals of one year in length.  Successful applicants will be asked to submit full proposals. The initial project proposals will be evaluated by the U.S. Section of the Yukon River Panel (Panel).  Authors of selected initial proposals will be notified by the Service to submit full proposals for final review.  The Panel reserves the right to ask questions for clarification and conduct negotiations with promising proposal authors prior to final selection. The Panel reserves the right to eliminate from consideration any proposals whose author does not provide clarification in a timely manner, if and when clarification is sought.  Panel recommendations on project selections will be forwarded to the Service for consideration of funding. The Service will then develop and award the financial assistance or contractual documents funding the final proposals that meet all federal requirements and for which funding is available.

<DESC>This is a request for proposal to develop an interagency Wilderness education plan for improved visitor experiences, increased public awareness about Wilderness and Wilderness related issues, and increased resource protection in designated Wilderness areas in southern Nevada.  Four federal agencies (the Bureau of Land Management [BLM], the National Park Service [NPS], the U.S. Forest Service [USFS] and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS]) are now working to jointly examine the Wilderness education needs within southern Nevada in an interagency context. The USFS is the lead agency for this Wilderness education planning project.  
  
Some of these Wildernesses have received little to no impact from human use while others are in the urban interface and receive a great deal of visitation and the associated impacts from that use.  This interagency Wilderness education plan will be for the following 20 Wildernesses and 1 Proposed Wilderness:

1.	Arrow Canyon:  27,530 acres, BLM
2.	Lime Canyon:  23,233 acres, BLM
3.	Jumbo Springs: 4,631 acres, BLM
4.	Muddy Mountains:  48,019 acres, BLM and NPS
5.	Jimbilnan:  18,879
6.	Pinto Valley:  39,173 acres, NPS
7.	Mount Charleston:  57,442 acres, FS and BLM
8.	La Madre Mountain:  47,180 acres, FS and BLM
9.	Rainbow Mountain:  24,997 acres, FS and BLM
10.	North McCullough:  14,763 acres, BLM
11.	Black Canyon:  17,220 acres, NPS
12.	Eldorado:  31,950 acres, NPS and BLM
13.	South McCullough:  44,245 acres, BLM
14.	Wee Thump Joshua Tree:  6,050 acres, BLM
15.	Ireteba Peaks:  32,745 acres, NPS and BLM
16.	Nellis Wash:  16,423 acres, NPS
17.	Spirit Mountain:  33,518 acres, NPS and BLM
18.	Bridge Canyon:  7,761 acres, NPS
19.	Desert National Wildlife Refuge (Proposed Wilderness) approximately 1.3 million acres, USF&WS.  
20.	Meadow Valley Range: 123,488 acres, BLM (Ely and Las Vegas Field Offices)
21.	Mormon Mountains: 157,938 acres, BLM (Ely and Las Vegas Field Offices)

There is substantial public interest in the Wilderness areas and each agency is currently receiving numerous inquiries regarding recreational opportunities, boundaries and access. The agencies, however, do not have prepared responses, informational literature, brochures, signage, Wilderness education programs or maps to provide to the public.  There are, however, projects currently underway to survey and post the Wilderness boundaries and provide maps of the Wilderness to the public.  There is also a project underway to place Wilderness information on the local internet web sites of each agency as well as on a Southern Nevada Interagency website.  

The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is Connie Moen.  She can be contacted at (702) 839-5562 with questions concerning the actual work to be performed.  Questions of an administrative and contracting nature should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, (CO), Steve Roehr at (702) 839-5575.

The Solicitation will be available at this site for download no later than 10/28/2006.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC,

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<CONTACT>Alice Sanders, Contracting Officer, Phone 210-536-3992, Fax 210-536-4563, Email alice.sanders@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>The 77 AESG and 648 AESS, Brooks City-Base TX intends to negotiate a sole source, cost-plus-fixed fee (CPFF) five-year requirement contract with Goodrich Corp/AMI, Colorado Springs CO (CAGE Code 31218), for a requirement to acquire coherent, technically consistent, engineering and manufacturing development support that will enhance the survivability of aircrew members through improved performance, maintainability, and availability of the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat II (ACES II) family of ejection seat.    

The principal goals of this effort are to develop and qualify modification improvements that will keep pace with aircraft operational mission requirements, and address aircrew safety issues associated with high-speed/high altitude operating environments.  Additionally, this effort will allow for an increase in ejection seat capability to support an extended ejection envelope for altitude and speed, and an improved maintainability capability that significantly reduces ejection seat maintenance downtime, resulting in increased aircraft operational availability.  The out come of this effort will be the development of modification kit(s) that can then be openly competed for production.  The respondent will develop, design, and build prototypes test articles that will demonstrate that a field-level modification kit can be retrofitted to existing ACES II ejection seats.  The respondent shall furnish all plant facilities, labor, equipment, special tools, test equipment, and materials. Government drawings, tooling, and facilities to manufacture these kits are not available.  

The resulting contract will cover all engineering, manufacturing, qualification testing on applicable sub-systems, integration, and any necessary development testing associated with improving the operation and maintenance of the ACES II ejection seat.  This will be accomplished by incorporating controllable propulsion subsystems to optimize terrain clearance during the ejection sequence, upgrading ejection seat sequencing and sensing subsystems for safer/faster/more reliable operation, and allowing the ACES II ejection seat to be removed from its crew station without the requirement to remove the aircraft canopy/hatch, which will significantly increase aircraft availability.  Additionally, this contract will address improving the ability to eliminate/mitigate limb flailing during high-speed ejection, and optimizing aircrew accommodation improvements for better access to aircraft controls and improved body position for aircraft operation and ejection.  This contract will cover all engineering and manufacturing efforts required in support of trade studies, preliminary designs, final designs, and design verification to determine the merits of the services described above.  

PLEASE NOTE THAT TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED. Responses should be submitted not later than fifteen days after synopsis appears in FBO. Only e-mailed, written or faxed requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered. FAX number is 210-536-4563 and e-mail address is alice.sanders@brooks.af.mil. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c )(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 30 Oct 06.  Estimated date of award is 15 Dec 06.  Any concerns regarding this acquisition may be directed to the Contracting Officer.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the Contracting Officer, interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Edward Noack at 210-536-2319 or e-mail edward.noack@brooks.af.mil.  Collect calls will not be accepted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.  NOTE:  ALL OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRY (CCR) PRIOR TO RECEIVING ANY AWARD.  Information concerning CCR requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Centers at 1-888-227-2423.  The Buyer is Ms Alice P.

The following qualifications will be evaluated:

(a) Professional registration of the engineering and surveying staff. Active professional registration of the engineering and surveying staff will be required in accordance with FAR 52.236-25.  It will not be necessary for prospective firms to hold registrations within the entire AOR at the time of submission of the SF 330, but the ability and willingness to obtain registration where it may be needed will be considered in evaluating qualifications.  

(b) ESRI certified trainers.   

(c) Recent experience of the firm (within the past 3 years) directly applicable to facilities management at federal and Navy facilities, particularly within the primary AOR of the continental United States. Applicable experience must be in the following areas (1) professional surveying and mapping of real property, (2) professional engineering and scientific support to facilities management,  (3) GIS feature and system development, and (4) integration of geospatial technologies with professional engineering, science, surveying, and mapping  services in support of the management of federal real property and facilities.

(d) Photogrammetric capabilities for obtaining, registering, rectifying, and mosaicing aerial photography and satellite imagery and use of LIDAR.  If this service is to be obtained via subcontract, must also provide documentation verifying subcontractual status with a firm qualified to provide such services.

(e) Capabilities to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands, with special focus on the project management function.

3.     Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost effectiveness (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).   

4.     Scheduling and Capacity: Ability to perform the work to schedules and capacity to accomplish multiple taskings simultaneously (show current and projected workload).  It is anticipated that workload under this contract will be very sporadic in nature, with long periods of no taskings interspersed with very high loading. Firms will be evaluated in terms of their ability to accomplish the work under these conditions and the impact of this workload on the staff's projected overall workload during the contract period.

5.     Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination.  Define the program and list key personnel responsible.

6.     Volume of Work: Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

7.     Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan: Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercial item/services:  Delivery and Storage of Cryogenic Propellants for Exploration Missions NASA/GRC plans to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for 1) a conceptual design study to evaluate and optimize a mass efficient, low power, reduced propellant loss approach for the propellant inventory and thermal control of cryogenic propellants for the Crew Exploration Vehicle Service Module (SM) and Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) exploration missions, and 2) design and fabrication of two cryogenic propellant RCS feedline manifolds to support ground based RCS testing at a NASA facility.  Background: NASA is currently developing the propulsion system concepts for exploration missions including a near term human return to the lunar surface and an eventual human mission to Mars. The propulsion options under consideration include the use of cryogenic propellants – liquid oxygen (LO2), liquid methane (LCH4) and/or liquid hydrogen (LH2) for several of the crewed, low gravity portions of the mission, that is, a Service Module (SM) for orbit maneuvering to the ISS and for orbit insertion required for lunar exploration missions and the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) for Lunar orbit capture, descent to the lunar surface and ascent to lunar orbit.  These concepts will require the cryogenic propellant inventory in the vehicle to be maintained during ground hold, the launch transient, during a long term, quiescent in-space storage at the ISS, for lunar injection, and during lunar operations. The cryogenic propellants must also be delivered in a vapor free condition to the Reaction Control Systems (RCS) thrusters and the Orbital Maneuvering Systems (OMS) engines of the vehicle.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   The anticipated release date of RFP NNC07175515P is on or about October 30 with an anticipated proposal due date of on or about November 14,2006. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB
EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT
PURSUANT TO FAR 35.016 AND 6.102(D)(2)

PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.

A.  INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this BAA, AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements in the area of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS).

This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 07, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/battlelab.asp.

B. OBJECTIVE:  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs in the area of ECS.  White papers should contain proposals for using existing or modified COTS or GOTS items to reduce the overall deployment footprint, e.g., volume, weight, and/or size of the equipment needed to conduct and support MAF operations at deployed locations.  Footprint reduction should not come at the expense of durability, adequacy in capability and power, and usability in prolonged operations.

ECS equipment should be simple in design and minimize the need for special tools.  Equipment configurations should avoid/minimize the need for any special support equipment beyond off-the-shelf assets.  All special equipment/tools required for assembly will be organic to ECS systems/components.  ECS systems /components must be air transportable.

ECS systems/components must be robust enough for diverse and harsh environments worldwide and operable in all climatic conditions.  Integrated ECS systems will provide the capability to support operations for an extended period.  ECS systems/components must withstand numerous and extended storage/deployment/use cycles.

ECS systems/components design must facilitate deployability, mission sizing, transportability, and storage.  Modularity for oversized or heavy items should be addressed and should not entail a large assembly burden on deploying forces.     

ECS systems must also be quick to: set up, become operational upon arrival at the deployed location, strike when the deployed capability is no longer required, and be designed for ease of reconstitution or disposal.

AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander, Air Mobility Warfare Center; Air Mobility Command Headquarters directorates and staff, Vice Commander, Air Mobility Command.  Submitters are encouraged to visit the AMB website at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/battlelab.asp.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), intends to issue a solicitation for an Enterprise System Development (ESD) procurement.  CMS is seeking to procure world-class Information Technology (IT) services under a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) performance based contract.  Through the ESD procurement, CMS is seeking to apply innovative approaches for the acquisition, delivery, and management of a broad range of IT services under the ESD Services Model.  The ESD Services Model will provide a new way to procure and manage IT services within the CMS environment.  These services will include planning, business requirements, design, development, test, maintenance, and technical support.  The model covers the spectrum of systems integration, system and application engineering, and technical support solutions to improve the development and support of the Agency?s automated systems and software applications.

To accomplish the aims of this procurement, CMS will need contractors experienced in software design, development, testing and maintenance in complex systems environments.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.  The ID/IQ contract will provide for two award categories, Unrestricted and Small Business Set-Aside.  The Unrestricted category will be open to all large and small business concerns.  The Small Business Set-Aside category will only be open to small business concerns in which the prime is classified as either an 8(a) contractor, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned or HUBZone.  All prime contractors must demonstrate an independent assessment of their process maturity for the Software Engineering Institute? Capability Maturity Model Integration? (CMMI?) through independent Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPISM), Class A (Versions 1.1 or 1.2) appraisal.  The prime contractors in the Unrestricted category must be certified a CMMI level 3 or higher while the prime contractors in the Small Business Set-Aside Category must be certified at CMMI level 2 or higher.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) will describe more specific CMMI requirements applicable to specific ESD Services Model Phases.

Qualified contractors will have a thorough understanding of the CMS business model, CMS systems, and industry benchmarks.  Contractors should also have experience delivering high-quality services and products in accordance with the CMS Integrated IT Investment & System Life Cycle Framework and CMS Enterprise Architecture (EA) standards (See the Enterprise Architecture section of the CMS website).

Interested contractors should be able to demonstrate their capability to partner with CMS and other qualified contractors (if a teaming arrangements are proposed) to provide a comprehensive, integrated solution to the delivery of ESD Services.  The Agency is committed to achieving its small business subcontracting goals.  Interested large business concerns should be able to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses.  Key Phases of the ESD Services Model will be restricted to the Small Business Set-Aside category.

In preparation for this acquisition, CMS will host an Industry Day on November 27, 2006 at CMS Headquarters, Multi-Purpose Room, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244-1850, from 9:00 am ? 12:30 pm.  Industry Day will include briefings by CMS leadership and management on the need for the ESD initiative and its critical importance to the CMS mission.  Attendance at this conference is optional and will have no bearing, influence, or impact on the selection process.  All contractors interested in attending the Industry Day should register with Ms. Karen Foster, by email only at Karen.Foster@cms.hhs.gov no later than November 15, 2006.  Due to the limited seating capacity, attendance is restricted to three (3) representatives per company.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning potential weapons capabilities for deployment from specified aircraft with little or no modification to the delivery platform. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses to determine the optimal solution.

This RFI is limited to soliciting information from domestic contracting companies only.

The Government does not intend to pay for any information solicited through this RFI and may or may not award a contract based on information contained therein.

This RFI is intended to solicit information on immediate solutions. Short-term and long-term solutions will be considered as possible spiral acquisition efforts. All responses should indicate the appropriate timeframe for the solution provided.  

Immediate solutions require less than 12 months from contract award to initial operational capability (IOC).
Short-term solutions require less than 24 months from contract award to IOC.
Long-term solutions require more than 24 months from contract award to IOC.

Potential solutions must satisfy the criteria below to be considered. However, the list is not all-inclusive, as the government seeks industry input for best practices/standards.

Weapon technologies used should be low-risk. Short, realistic schedules are required. Higher-risk, more complex capabilities (e.g., Targets under Trees (TUT), shallow caves, and tunnel entrances) may be added as spiral acquisition efforts.

The weapon should have a high Pk against the following targets: personnel, soft vehicles, (SUVs, and their personnel), non-reinforced structures (e.g., wood, brick, and mud huts; residential construction; communication towers), and small boats. Spiral efforts to obtain a high Pk against shallow caves, tunnels, and TUT are also of interest.

The weapon system should be a self-contained, "roll-on, bolt-on" (e.g., no laser designation of target; no power or data from aircraft), highly accurate guided munition to sustain at least a four hour mission.

"Roll-on, bolt-on" capability with little or no aircraft modification is required. Weapon should be flexible enough for maximum (multiple) platform compatibility with various lug spacings or launching/delivery systems.

Weapon should have simple build-up and loading procedures. If any special equipment is required for assembly or loading, it should be identified and provided. Weight class between 100 and 500-lbs is desired. Weapon systems of different weight classes may be addressed as spiral acquisition efforts. Temporary mountings for GPS antennae or batteries are acceptable, provided they make no permanent change to the aircraft (e.g., taping GPS antenna to window, or incorporating battery power into a pylon mounting).

Minimal pilot/aircrew interface indicating in-LAR/out-of-LAR is desired; however, simply flying to a pre-designated area is acceptable. The interface should not require permanent changes to the aircraft (e.g., no rewiring of power to hard points). A BIT-check is desired, but is not a threshold requirement. Pilot/aircrew interface will release weapon with minimal operator input (e.g., pull a trigger, push a button).

Targeting data will be loaded before mission departs and derived from GPS (WGS 84) coordinates. In-flight targeting is not required. Once the target coordinates are loaded from a ground station, the pilot will have no additional input to the weapon until the aircraft is within the LAR. The "In-LAR" signal will be given by a "green light", and the pilot or aircrew will release the weapon.

Weapon mission reliability for a successful release and engagement should be 90%. Successful release is defined as "the weapon safely separating from the aircraft with an armed fuze, and working guidance system". Successful engagement is defined as "the weapon navigating to the target area and detonating".

Weapon equipment and containers should be strengthened and reinforced for harsh outdoor conditions.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of previous and on-going contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it accordingly. The Government reserves the right to ask respondents to provide additional information or details based on initial submissions. 

The Government would like to be appraised if any of the above requirements are viewed as cost and/or schedule drivers.

GOVERNMENT INFORMATION
AAC/XR uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the capabilities solicited in this RFI. Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits the service contactors from using the data for any other purpose than for which it was presented.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification; it is in no way binding to the Government.

RESPONSES
An annex containing relevant classified information applicable to this RFI will be provided on an individual basis to interested companies that furnish the following: CAGE code along with a secret facility clearance verification, to the Government and applicable to this RFI. Please submit this information within five (5) days of the release of this RFI.

Responses should include only the top three candidates that can meet the requirements and guidelines previously described.

Responses should be single-spaced, 12-point font, with numbered pages, and should not exceed 25 pages in length, including cover page, appendices, tables, and figures. The date reponses are due is November 18, 2006 (except for the information required within 5 days of the release of this RFI as stated above).

Electronic submissions should use the following subject heading: Determining Munitions Options for Quick Installation on an Arbitrary Platform. Additionally, these submissions must be properly marked, and sent to the following classified email address: nadine.lynn@eglin.af.smil.mil and stanley.ness@eglin.af.smil.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Phase 2- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer).  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.

<DESC>This notice of intent is amended to answer questions received from an interested party.  The due date for capability statements is extended until October 24, 2006 at 1PM EDT.

Question #1:

What are the standards that need to be met to become an approved FDA GMP facility?

Answer #1:

This information is available at  http://www.fda.gov/cder/dmpq/index.htm    Scroll down to near the bottom to find a subheading on GMP for storage of GMP drugs.

Daily monitoring, record keeping and availability of backup freezers and generators are an important part of the compliance.

Question #2:

How large of a refrigerated facility is needed to store the product?

Answer #2:

We have some 6000 vials that need to be stored at ultra low temperatures of -70 to -95 degrees Centigrade. Vials are 1 to 5 ml in size

Question #3:

Does the delivery to Rockville, MD require a refrigerated vehicle or are the shipments small enough to be in a cooler?

Answer #3:

Delivery of shipments varies; the critical part is that the samples must be at the -70 to -95 temperature.  Occasionally, some shipments could come in a cooler, but often would require a delivery vehicle that could maintain the temperature for the travel time.



The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch (MB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for GMP Storage and Delivery of Clinical Grade GMP Reagents with Fisher BioServices Inc., 14665 Rothgeb Drive, Rockville, MD  20850,  for a one year base period with two one-year option periods.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 493120 and the business size standard is $23.5M.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  In its effort to bring new drugs successfully into the clinic, drugs developed in the MB are contracted to be made under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to meet FDA standards for use in clinical trials involving human patients.  These drugs must be stored at -70 degrees under FDA GMP regulations at a GMP approved facility that is within five hour drive of the NIH Clinical Center Hospital.  The facility must be within five hours should a need arise on an emergency basis in order to treat a patient on protocol.  Any deviation from this specification could ruin countless hours of Government effort spent in drug development, manufacturing costs and testing and could invalidate critical clinical trials and or patient health.  Fisher BioServices is the only vendor known to the NCI researcher that is within a five hour trip of the NCI Clinical Center that has a GMP approved facility and can store clinical materials at -70 degrees under FDA GMP regulations.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on October 24, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>STACEY DIAMOND CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487309     sdiamond@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting a public-private competition for the operation of the Geospatial Information Office (GIO), National Geospatial Technology Operations Center (NGTOC) located in Rolla, Missouri and Denver, CO. This competition was announced in Fed Biz Opps on September 30, 2005, revised on February 1, 2006 and August 29, 2006 (See http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOI/USGS/USGS/06HQSS0002/SynopsisP.html). Under the rules of OMB Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003), the Government will submit a proposal for a civil-servant led team or Most Efficient Organization (MEO) to perform the functions as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) which will be released at a later date. The estimated draft PWS release date is November 28, 2006. The NAICS Code is 541990. The Rolla MEO is operating under the name Rolla NGTOC MEO and is seeking to partner with industry to collaborate in the development of the Rolla NGTOC MEO proposal. The Rolla NGTOC MEO is looking for written expressions of interest from potential partners for operational services as outlined below: (1) Develop and operate geospatial data integration, access, and archive capabilities, (2) perform data quality control and integration, (3) provide technical back office support to partners, (4) provide data steward training and support, (5) generate map graphics and maintain analog map archive, (6) provide digital geospatial information access, archive, and dissemination services, (7) provide support services such as administrative and generic information technology support, (8) provide contract administration and management support for geospatial services, (9) conduct geospatial information science research, (10) assess and recommend for implementation, technological innovations for geospatial data and applications, (11) develop data theme business and investment strategy and data integration, (12) provide oversight of the design, implementation, and operations of data integration, access, archive and ensure the quality of services relevant to NGTOC, and (13) support development of industry-based standards that support geospatial infrastructures. Go to the following URL to learn more about the organization: http://www.usgs.gov/ngpo. Interested parties should submit their capabilities statement to include: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel: This criterion evaluates the potential partners' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar activities, technical capability to perform the work, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the potential partner's ability to control both cost and schedule. Potential partners should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Value-added services: This criterion evaluates the potential partner's ability to provide additional support services to the Rolla MEO team during the proposal development process. Responses to this notice should be no more than 8 pages, and should include, at a minimum: Name and address of firm; Size/ownership of business, i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Woman owned business, and Hub Zone; Number of years in business; Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and e-mail; DUNS number; Experience and familiarity with providing the services listed above either individually or in a consolidate services type environment, prime contracts, subcontracts; Specific areas listed above that the potential partner is interested in supporting, including how well the potential partner's core competencies suit the targeted areas above and how this benefits the Rolla NGTOC MEO; and A statement detailing the potential partner's current business relationships with the USGS. Please include contract number and NAICS codes, if possible. The Rolla NGTOC MEO will be reviewing past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interests to ensure compliance with organizational conflicts of interest requirements at FAR Subpart 9.5. The interests described above include those of the partner, its affiliates, proposed consultants, or proposed subcontractors. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. If a request for quotation is issued, it is expected that only those responding to this information request will be asked to respond to an RFQ. The partner(s) selected through that process will be asked to provide, at no cost to the USGS Rolla NGTOC MEO, the necessary conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates to be responsive to the requirements of the USGS. Upon USGS selection of the winning offer of the standard competition, it is anticipated that the Rolla MEO proposal would result in contract(s) for the selected partner. However, as the Rolla MEO, we cannot guarantee that this partnering opportunity will result in the award of any contracts by the Government, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment by the USGS to pay for the information this notice is soliciting. The Rolla MEO has an interest in making its decision on partnering opportunities as soon as practical. The due date for the written submission of responses to this notice will be 4PM November 3, 2006.  After the written submission, the Rolla NGTOC MEO will conduct oral presentations as early as the week of December 11th, 2006 at the USGS in Rolla, MO. All invited guests will be notified approximately 2-3 weeks prior with additional relevant information. The preferred method of response to this notice is by email to the attention of Paul M. Young, Agency Tender Official for the Rolla MEO, at pyoung@usgs.gov.  Procurement questions should be directed to Stacey C. Diamond, Contracting Officer (703) 648-7309 or by email at sdiamond@usgs.gov.

Travers, Contracting Officer, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7953. 

BACKGROUND: The USPS is deploying the Postal Automated Redirection System (PARS) on a nationwide basis.  As part of this effort, there is a requirement to print address move information for use by individual letter carriers at the various mail delivery units located throughout the United States and select territories.  The PARS deployment will require the purchase and deployment of approximately 30,000 printers at the mail delivery units.   

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: The printers must be capable of meeting the following performance requirements:  

Print Method:		Thermal Transfer
Resolution:		203 DPI 
Print Length:		39?
Print Width:		4.09? maximum

The printers will interface with existing computers and workstations on the USPS network running Windows XP operating systems.  The connection will be USB interface to the computer. Paper and other consumables will be provided by the Postal Service.  

SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES: For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide performance data for available systems for USPS review. This information should include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor?s ability to meet the requirements in this specification. This written information shall be provided no later than October 23, 2006. Minor variations to the values expressed within the above specification will be considered by the USPS if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications. Following USPS review of the submitted system performance data, pre-qualification determination will be made and competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished. The prequalified suppliers are firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards. The USPS will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  

MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary?s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

The government reserves the right to request special justification in the circumstance for considering one or more legal non-US citizen students, who hold valid green cards, participation in research for or for sponsorship through an MSTAR Program award.  

At the conclusion of the MSTAR program, MDA intends to establish positions for successful and selected graduates who participated in and positively contributed to research and development funded through the MSTAR Program.  Individuals selected for such positions will be required to obtain the necessary security clearances.  The funding and billets for the future positions have not been confirmed to date.  Once approval to establish the positions is granted, MDA will make a separate announcement.

1.3.  Network Security.  The service provider shall comply with all computer system and network security procedures required by the Government
1.4. Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP).  The Government will appoint a QAP.  The QAP will solicit end-user feedback to rate service provider?s performance.
2.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.  
2.1.  Requirement.  The service provider shall provide all labor, personnel, materials, supervision, transportation, all documentation, software, code, files, schematics/drawings, database architecture design, etc that support each of the applications listed in paragraph 2.2.a. as necessary to perform maintenance support required.  All software documentation (e.g., code and data) remain the property of the U.S. Government.  The service provider shall ensure the Government has ownership and accessibility to all developed software code and files associated with the project.  
2.2.  Support.  The service provider shall provide telephone support during normal business hours (M-F 0730-1700).   E-mail support shall be provided 24/7 and a technician will be available with a 24-hour notice for support required after normal business hours.  The service provider shall respond within 30 minutes upon notification of problems/questions during normal business hours and has two hours to identify a plan for resolution.  If the work is not resolved to the end-user?s satisfaction, the service provider shall perform the service again, at no additional cost to the government.  The service provider shall supply the Government with a monthly update report on activities and tasks performed the prior month and a list of tasks/goals planned for the next month.  
2.2.1.  Cadet In-Processing.  The service provided shall provide on-site support for 6 staff days during Cadet In-Processing which occurs in June of each year.
2.2.2.  Monthly Reports.   The service provider shall provide monthly written reports on activities and tasks performed.  The reports shall include at a minimum: service provider names, number of hours worked on each task, completed tasks, problems encountered with recommended solutions, list of completed deliverables, and a list of tasks/goals planned for the next month.
2.3.  Cadet Administrative Management Information System (CAMIS).  Five of the software application modules are slated to be migrated into CAMIS.  The service provider shall participate in CAMIS Modernization software lifecycle activities (i.e. engage in discussions, reviews, and provide comments/clarifications to review minutes, attend informal information gathering meetings) to include:  requirements gathering by the CAMIS Modernization service provider, configuration control board meetings, requirements reviews, preliminary design reviews and testing.  Any modifications to these applications before CAMIS Modernization implementation will be coordinated with the CAMIS Modernization service provider before hand and shall follow the CAMIS standards.  
2.3.1.  CAMIS - Inventory Management System/Flight Issue/Summer Programs (IMS/IEU).  IMS/EIU is a web-based database used to maintain and track of uniforms and flight gear, etc. issued to the cadets as well as consumption of inventory and accountability.  These transactions are then downloaded to the Accounting Liaison Office and the cadet is charged for the items.  There are approximately 30 thin client terminals used to access the IMS database, in addition to desktop workstations.
2.3.2.  CAMIS - Rifle/Armory.  This web-based software application module tracks cadet issue/return of rifles for the academic year.  The application also helps to maintain an accurate inventory of all issued rifles, to include the cadet the rifle was issued to, how many rifles are in for repair, and how many rifles are still in the armory. 
2.3.3.  CAMIS - Tailor Shop & Shoulder Boards Support System (TASS).  This database creates a cadet account by name and social security number and stores the cadet?s measurements.  Once the garment sizes are imported into the system the cadet?s uniform is ready for alterations.  A bar code is attached to each alteration tag thus allowing the Tailor Shop to track the location of each garment until it is turned over to the cadet.  This program will also allow the Tailor Shop to query the system to see who has not showed up for a fitting or clothing issue.
2.3.4.  CAMIS - Military Performance Average (MPA).  MPA provides a comprehensive assessment of a cadet?s military performance.  Factors used to determine the MPA are as follows:  athletics, academics, duty performance, initiative, teamwork, character, leadership, supervision, and inputs from instructors, coaches, and Officer in Charge (OIC).  Cadets will be assigned an MPA rating at the completion of summer program for 1st and 2nd class cadets, and at the end of the fall and spring semesters for all cadets.  The MPA is based on a 4.0 rating scale, with a 4.0 being the best and 0.0 being the worst.  A 2.0 represents the minimum standard of acceptable performance.  An MPA rating below 2.0 is a deficient evaluation.  The MPA is used in conjunction with a cadet?s Grade Point Average (GPA) and Physical Education Average (PEA) to determine their graduation order of merit.
2.3.5.  CAMIS - Sponsor Program.  This program allows the Sponsor Office to match cadets with a family in the local area (a home away from home).  Each incoming cadet and prospective sponsor family fills out a short questionnaire.  The database sorts through all the information and makes the best matches possible.  The database will allow the Sponsor Office to hand assign cadets to certain sponsors, print all sponsor and cadet address labels, print out assignment letters, query the database according to a particular religion, state, race, etc.
2.3.6.  NAF - Rental/ITT (Point of Sale (POS) and Event Scheduling) ORC/Ski.  This POS application has serialized inventory control and packaging.  It allows separation of NAF and Appropriated funds for inventory purposes.  The ski rental component provides DIN setting for ski bindings and allows for unlimited package pricing options and seasonal rentals.  It also accounts for other items sold such as lift tickets and hunting licenses.  This system has output formats for AF Form 1875a,  NAF Individual Cashier?s Report, and AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center Report.  The ITT system allows reservations for trips, tours, rental properties and other offerings.  It also tracks commissions and accounts for deposits and all required AF Forms.   Outdoor Recreation Center was written many years ago in Progress Version 7 and is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
2.3.7.  NAF - Cadet Entertainment.  A web-based POS application used by the ticket office to sell tickets for coming attractions at Arnold Hall (i.e., Cadet Bluebard productions, Air Force Band of the Rockies concerts, rock concerts, comedians and Broadway Performances).  It also records all funds received from ticket sales.  
2.3.8.  NAF - Package Management and POS (UPS, Gift).  With the UPS system they are able to log in packages delivered to cadets, by their Post Office Box numbers.  The system sends out an automatic e-mail to notify the cadet that he/she has a package to pickup.  If the cadet doesn?t pickup his/her package within a certain amount of time a 2nd and 3rd notice are sent out.  The package is logged out of the program when the cadet picks up the package.
2.3.9.  Civil Engineering - Key Control Asset Tracking.  This program is used to maintain better accountability of over 25,000 keys.  It prevents issuing keys to opposite genders, overbooking a room; it produces a variety of reports i.e., number of rooms per squadron, number of occupants per squadron, number of occupants per rooms, number of lost keys per squadron, etc.  It also has the ability to charge cadet accounts for replacing lost keys.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



1.  SCOPE

a.  The U.S. Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT), Systems Management Division, at Randolph AFB, TX, seeks qualified sources capable of providing a full range of basic aircraft training services to include but not be limited to ground-based academics, simulator, and actual flight instruction applicable to Pilot Flight Screening; Basic through Certified Flight Instructor Pilot qualification presented under a ?military style? disciplined training program.  Training is required on a regular basis to support the reconstruction of the Iraqi Air Force.  This effort can be expected to consist of instructing at least 100-200 personnel annually to obtain a graduate population of approximately 50 fixed-wing and 50 rotary pilots annually for the next 3 to 5 years.  All training will take place in Iraq and require flight instructors that are military training oriented (previous military basic flight training experience is highly desired), fluent in the Arabic language, and capable of flight operations in various single and multi-engine fixed and rotary wing training and light cargo airlift aircraft.

b.  To simplify and speed-up the procurement process for acquiring training and related services, it is essential that respondents be willing/able to act as a single point integrator for all required training services.  The full range of training personnel (academic, simulator, and flight) are the responsibility of the respondent and will be either directly sourced internally or by sub-contract with other vendors for services not directly under their control.

c.  Unless otherwise specified, assume all instruction and technical information will be presented at the unclassified level delivered under the auspices of the U.S. Security Assistance Training Program.  All international military students will be fluent in Iraqi and/or English.  Students will normally have no previous aircraft experience and will require an assessment of Flight Screening that will transition to a final graduate capable of flying advanced multi-engine aircraft.

d.  All instructional services and materials will be provided by the contractor at a location within Iraq.   Training aircraft, simulators, and facilities will be provided by the Iraqi government and/or deployed USAF organization.  Fixed wing training aircraft will be single engine light trainer/cargo type aircraft similar to Cessna 172 or Diamond Aviation 20.  Rotary wing trainer will be similar to Bell Jet Ranger and/or UH-1 with Huey II modification.  Additionally, flight training may be required to qualified Iraqi pilots in newly acquired King Air 350, Cessna Caravan and CASA 212-400 aircraft.


	e.  The objective of specified aircrew training is to rebuild the Iraqi Air Force with pilots transitioning into various fixed and rotary wing aircraft such that they attain the necessary skills for safe and competent operation of the various systems and subsystems of the aircraft.  This includes required ground school, flight simulator, and flying instruction manuals and documents provided in both the Arabic and English languages.  Contractor format training courseware may be utilized if equivalent to military training standards (as determined by AFSAT), or access to government-furnished training curricula and/or syllabi may be made available.  Delivered training must provide students the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and perform specified flight duties in their assigned aircraft.  The contractor will verify and document student gained knowledge and skills through testing and exercises.

	f.  Training is expected to consist of classroom lecture/discussion sessions, practical exercises using appropriate training devices and/or training aids, and inflight instructional training in the actual aircraft.  Flight training devices (simulators) will be used to enhance ground academics and serve as a transition from ground training to the flight training phase.  The fidelity of the flight training device will replicate the training systems and flying characteristics with a sufficient level necessary to achieve the training objective.

2.  REQUIRED RESPONSE INFORMATION

	a.  Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested, qualified, capable sources with proven and/or high confidence ability to deliver and support a complete pilot training program using provided training assets.

	b.  Interested parties who believe they have the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities should submit technical capabilities in writing.  Respondents are asked to include sufficient detail to illustrate their ability to support required training and define as specifically as possible, the approach they expect to employ to deliver this training and achieve the desired results.

	c.  Details with respect to past experience in the provision of similar flight training or related air services contracts are a firm requirement for any response and should be sufficiently detailed so as to illustrate their relative level of scope.  Include a description of the services provided, customer(s), location(s), period(s) of performance, and customer contact information we may use to verify such experience.

	d.  Respondent(s) are encouraged to identify any aspects of this training effort that are considered especially high risk or unlikely to be supportable, as currently defined.  This information, along with any constructive work-arounds or alternative training concepts that may be suggested, will help determine the overall feasibility of sourcing this training via commercial means.

Technical questions may be addressed to AFSAT/DOM, Dwyer Stringer (210) 652-3746 or Ron Oswalt (210) 652-2422.

<DESC>Grenade, Hand, Incendiary, TH3, AN-M14 (NSN: 1330-00-219-8557; Dodic G900). Grenade, Hand, Incendiary, TH3, AN-M14 is made up of a M201A1 fuze, a seamed metal can, and a Thermate fill. The use of the AN-M14 is to develop an intense heat source to des troy equipment and potentially to start fires. The functioning of the AN-M14 is as follows: removal of the safety pin allows release of the safety lever; release of the lever allows a striker to swing and impact upon a primer. The primer ignites a delay co lumn inside the fuze. After the delay column burns down, the heat generated by the burning column ignites a Starter Mixture. The starter mixture in turn ignites the TH3 Thermate filler. Specification MIL-G-12297 contains complete requirements for testing a nd qualifying the Grenade AN-M14. The government will consider other commercial or non-development products intended to destroy equipment and potentially start fires in a similar hand-held configuration. Any potential candidate should be able to generate a  temperature of approximately 4000 Degrees F, burn for 30 - 45 seconds, provide a delay time of between 0.7 - 2 seconds, and weigh approximately 32 oz. or less.  This Market Survey is intended to determine if there are companies that can manufacture the AN-M14 Incendiary Grenade (DODIC G900). A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and satisfactory past per formance in the energetics processing industry. Producers with established Thermate manufacturing expertise separate from Hand-Held or AN-M14 configurations should also respond to this Market Survey. Provide details on the similar compositions manufactured  and ability to transition to this production requirement. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. The response should also address the following: 1. Provide current or previous experience in manufacture to the TDPL or representative items, including potential capacity (with supporting detail of the specific assembly stations), facilities available, required start-up efforts and past performance hist ory. 2. If wish to provide alternate design concepts, provide any technical data, drawings, production history and capacity to support evaluation by the US Government. 3. Provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost for this item (for a quantity of 100,000 g renades). Request inclusion of Minimum Order quantity and what factors affect minimum order quantities. 4. Provide an estimate for the schedule required to establish or re-establish the production. Include any information on long-lead materials or schedule  drivers. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of subtier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database. Interested parties have  30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item.  Any response to this market research should reference the following: W52P1J-07-R-0010.  Please submit to: US Army Sustainment Command, ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-M, Mark Haldeman, 1 Rock Island, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000, email: haldemanm@afsc.army.mil.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Compton Imaging System of Radioactive Sources
<DESC>Compton Imaging System of Radioactive Sources For Homeland Security Applications

Opportunity:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to partner with LLNL and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to further develop its Compton Imaging technology.

Background:  Most of the gamma-ray imaging systems existing today use position sensitive scintillators, which have good efficiency, but lack good energy resolution, and their position resolution decreases significantly with increasing energy. LLNL has demonstrated methods that will help improve the resolution and sensitivity of Compton imagers using cyrogenically-cooled, position-sensitive semiconductor detectors. DHS has released a Request for Information for which this technology is well suited. 

Description:  LLNL is developing a highly-sensitive compact Compton imaging technology with excellent energy resolution, good imaging performance and large field-of-view.  This system is built of large-volume and high-resolution Si(Li) and HPGe detectors.  These detectors are built in double-sided strip configurations providing excellent three-dimensional position resolution.  The system can measure individual gamma-ray interactions and determine interactions sequences through gamma-ray tracking algorithms.

Advantages:  LLNL?s system will enable real-time imaging of radioactive sources.  With further development, we envision a scalable Compton imaging module. An moderate-sized array of such modules would extend the detection range to 30-50 m, while a large array may extend detection to 100 m.

Potential Applications: The methods will increase the image resolution and sensitivity of gamma-ray imaging systems used for national security, military, and medical imaging applications.  In particular, gamma-ray imagers are important in surveillance, monitoring, and search applications (i.e., stand-off detection). 

Development Status:  LLNL has developed excellent performance of a second-generation, hybrid Compton imaging system built using two Si(Li) detectors in a single cryostat and two HPGe detectors in a single cryostat. As such, significant steps have been taken to address physics and engineering challenges associated with Compton imaging. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Parties interested in working with LLNL on developing and licensing the Compton Imaging technology must respond in writing to LLNL addressing each of the items listed below.  

1.	Name of company, location(s) and descriptions including
a.	Recent annual report or other overview of your organization and the team that you are proposing 
b.	Experience relevant to working on Federally funded joint projects
c.	Experience with developing and commercializing radiation detection technologies
d.	Experience with Department of Homeland Security

Written responses should be directed to:

Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 134-06

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Compton Imaging technology.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) No. 06-14-AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.  This technology is anticipated for the Aerodynamic Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) facility at AEDC, however concepts that can be applied to other hypersonic test facilities will be considered.  4) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF HYPERSONIC NOZZLE FLOWS.  In most hypersonic ground test facilities the test gas is energized in a plenum, expanded in a nozzle and then presented to a test article in a test chamber.  It is recognized that energy modes and gas species vary from an isentropic flow process in the rapidly expanding flow.  While the test gas is unlikely to duplicate the flight condition, knowledge of its composition will assist in interpretation of test data.  This effort seeks measurement and modeling of facility flow parameters with the intent of applying the results to a variety of hypersonic facility flows.  5) EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR HYPERSONIC SEPARATION DYNAMICS.  It is expected that next-generation hypersonic weapon systems will employ some type of armament/munitions separation during an aerodynamic maneuver from a carrier vehicle in hypersonic atmosphere flight.  A vast store of subsonic aircraft armament/munitions separation information is available.  Some hypersonic work was accomplished for the space shuttle separation issues several decades ago.  The objective of this solicitation is to investigate and identify flight phenomena incurred during body separation with the goal of simulating the environment with aerodynamic models in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a Captive Trajectory System (CTS).  Research in this topic should use the current state-of-the-art as a starting point and define those things that need to be improved or developed (e.g. dynamic force balance sensitivity to rapidly changing loads as the two-body shock-induced flow fields interact).

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5 - $3.0M are expected to be made in FY07.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 30 Jun 17.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror’s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

The Justice Program Advisor will work with the U.S. Embassy to Afghanistan and the INL Bureau to create and implement U.S. foreign policy directives regarding the rebuilding of the justice sector in Afghanistan, focusing specifically on criminal justice and corrections.  

Background

INL manages justice programs in Afghanistan totaling around $30 million annually.  The management of a complex program of that size and importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires someone with significant management and legal expertise to develop, monitor and troubleshoot all aspects of the program.

General Program Description

The INL Afghanistan Justice Advisor will provide advice and assistance to ensure the successful implementation of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Afghanistan. The justice advisor will be a member of the Embassy Special Committee on Rule of Law and will represent INL?s justice programs to senior U.S., international and Afghan officials.  

INL is responsible for implementing U.S. foreign assistance programs designed to complement Afghan and international efforts to reestablish Afghanistan?s justice sector.  Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to increase public awareness and access to justice. 

To achieve these goals, the Justice Advisor must be able to effectively oversee three major contracted programs and possibly more in the future including (1) the Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP) with around 20 U.S. and Afghan justice advisors and security and support staff in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-sharif and Jalalabad, (2) the Corrections System Support Program (CSSP) with around 20 U.S. corrections advisors and security and support staff, and (3) the LLM program, a grant with a U.S. University which is bringing about 20 Afghan law professors to the U.S. to earn LLM degrees.

The Justice Advisor will work with in-country and Washington-based contract officer-designates in addition to working with the program office in Washington, DC.

This form acknowledges that the proposer and subcontractors are aware of their obligation to have all technical reports, papers, and presentations reviewed by DoD prior to release.  This is required to ensure adherence to DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  

Section II  Summary of Proposal 

This section provides an overview of the proposed work as well as an introduction to the associated technical and management issues, and the applicability of the work to test and evaluation of weapons systems.  Further elaboration of all items will be provided in Section III.  

A.  Innovative claims for the proposed research.  This section is the centerpiece of the proposal and should succinctly describe the uniqueness and benefits of the proposed approach relative to the current state-of-the-art and alternate approaches.  

B.  Deliverables associated with the proposed research and the plans and capability to accomplish technology transition and commercialization.  Include in this section all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, intellectual property, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototype.  If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.  

C.  Cost, schedule, and milestones for the proposed research, including estimates of cost for each task in each year of the effort, total cost, and company cost share.  

D.  Technical rationale, technical approach, and constructivesome type of armament/munitions separation during an aerodynamic maneuver from a carrier vehicle in hypersonic atmosphere flight.  A vast store of subsonic aircraft armament/munitions separation information is available.  Some hypersonic work was accomplished for the space shuttle separation issues several decades ago.  The objective of this solicitation is to investigate and identify flight phenomena incurred during body separation with the goal of simulating the environment with aerodynamic models in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a Captive Trajectory System (CTS).  Research in this topic should use the current state-of-the-art as a starting point and define those things that need to be improved or developed (e.g. dynamic force balance sensitivity to rapidly changing loads as the two-body shock-induced flow fields interact).

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5 - $3.0M are expected to be made in FY07.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 17 Jul 2006.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror’s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) No. 06-14-AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.  This technology is anticipated for the Aerodynamic Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) facility at AEDC, however concepts that can be applied to other hypersonic test facilities will be considered.  4) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF HYPERSONIC NOZZLE FLOWS.  In most hypersonic ground test facilities the test gas is energized in a plenum, expanded in a nozzle and then presented to a test article in a test chamber.  It is recognized that energy modes and gas species vary from an isentropic flow process in the rapidly expanding flow.  While the test gas is unlikely to duplicate the flight condition, knowledge of its composition will assist in interpretation of test data.  This effort seeks measurement and modeling of facility flow parameters with the intent of applying the results to a variety of hypersonic facility flows.  5) EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR HYPERSONIC SEPARATION DYNAMICS.  It is expected that next-generation hypersonic weapon systems will employ  objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.

TRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations.  In addition, the leveraging of current S&T program developments is highly encouraged.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan.  A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding the dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). 

Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  While TRMC will not actively participate in the teaming of project partners, potential proposers are encouraged to examine the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) member sites to acquaint themselves with the scope of test facilities and capabilities within the purview of Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  
The DOT&E/Resources and Ranges website for the MRTFB map and links is http://www.dote.osd.mil/rr/mrtfb.html.  

SUBMISSION PROCESS 

Proposers are REQUIRED to submit a proposal abstract in advance of a full proposal.  This procedure is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review.  The date for submission of proposal abstracts is specified in the FedBizOpps announcement.  Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) will acknowledge receipt of the submission and assign a control number that should be used in all future correspondence regarding the proposal abstract and proposal. 

TRMC will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to propose or not propose and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  TRMC will attempt to review proposal abstracts within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt and will allow proposers at least thirty (30) calendar days after review of their proposal abstracts in order to complete and submit their full proposals.  Regardless of the recommendation, the decision to propose is the responsibility of the proposer.  All submitted proposals will be fully reviewed regardless of the disposition of the proposal abstract.  

Proposers will be notified of acceptance or rejection within 30 days of receipt of the full proposal.  However, those proposals not initially selected will be kept on file until 30 September 2007.  In the event that the T&E/S&T program budget allocation for hypersonics is increased prior to the end of the fiscal year, these non-selected proposals may be funded.  

The typical proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of one or more related technical concepts or ideas.  Disjointed efforts should not be included into a single proposal.  
Proposers are notified that all proposals may be read, reviewed, evaluated and/or administratively handled by support contractors either to TRMC (i.e., IDA, MITRE and other non-federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) contractors) or to the executing agent.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in TRMC technical research in this program area and are individually bound by appropriate signed nondisclosure statements.  A proposer sending either an abstract or a full proposal acknowledges that this is acceptable to the proposer.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any sent by this method will be disregarded.  

Awards made under this solicitation are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any TRMC technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 2.101, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA/EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESSES 

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  TRMC's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.  

For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the two-volume document described in PROPOSAL FORMAT (see below).  Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered part of the proposal.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  

(l) overall scientific and technical merit in advancing test and evaluation of hypersonic systems, (2) relevance to T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort, and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.
As each proposal evaluation is completed, the proposer will be notified of selectability or non-selectability.  Selectable proposals will be considered for funding; non-selectable proposals will be kept on file until 30 September 2007.  These proposals will be considered for FY07 funding in the event additional funds are made available to support the hypersonics T&E/S&T focus area.  After 30 September 2007, all unfunded proposals will be destroyed.  (One copy of non-selectable proposals may be retained for file purposes.) 

While the TRMC T&E/S&T program is expected to be on-going, prospective offerors are notified that this program is currently not formally funded in FY 2007, and there is no certainty that these funds will be made available for this purpose.  Even when funding is received, not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds available, potential contribution and relevance to T&E mission, and scientific and technical merit.  Proposals may be considered for funding for a period of up to one year.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by TRMC.   
Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options  

PROPOSAL ABSTRACT FORMAT 

Proposal abstracts are required in advance of full proposals in order to provide potential offerors with a rapid response and to minimize unnecessary effort.  Proposal abstracts should follow the same general format as described for Volume I under PROPOSAL FORMAT (see below), but include ONLY Sections I and II.  The cover sheet should be clearly marked PROPOSAL ABSTRACT, and the total length should not exceed 15 pages.  All pages should be formatted to 8-1/2- by 11-inch page size with type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitation for proposal abstracts includes all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 
BAA No.  06-14 AEDC/PKP
 
This section provides further information on Hypersonics Test and Evaluation Development, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal and proposal abstract formats, and other general information.

The Test and Resource Management Center (TRMC) is selecting its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This announcement in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) constitutes the only solicitation.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to the solicitation.

TRMC is soliciting research proposals in the area on Hypersonics Test and Evaluation Development.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, systems, or methodologies as they apply to Test and Evaluation (T&E).  

TRMC seeks innovative proposals in the hypersonics area that will allow improved test and evaluation of current systems and future systems requiring test and evaluation over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to perform basic research, but to develop subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and/or tests in a simulated environment.  The results of this type of effort are proof of technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  TRMC seeks advances in test and evaluation of hypersonic systems and related T&E technologies which will advance the state of the art beyond today’s science and technology (S&T) testing methodologies to address performance, operability, and durability of hypersonic systems and components.  

A list (not to be considered all-inclusive nor in priority order) of areas that require advances in test and evaluation technologies are:  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The
