<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has issued a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. The PV Technology Incubator project represents a significant component of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) business strategy of partnering with U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of photovoltaic system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This specific partnership leverages technical capabilities and resources within the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and other DOE laboratories/facilities to enhance and support areas of expertise within a small business in order to accelerate the development of the Responders technology. This early-stage assistance in crossing the technological barriers to commercialization also provides a better level of understanding and development for the investment community to base decisions on. The U.S. DOE wants to help the most promising technologies capitalize on these investments to take the final steps toward commercialization. The PV Technology Incubator supports the goals of the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Program (SETP), which aggressively funds a diverse set of PV technologies that will help solar electricity achieve high penetration across the United States and grid parity by 2015. This is accomplished by helping promising technologies take the first step towards crossing the barriers to commercialization. The Solicitation for LOIs shall be available to view/download from NREL's website at http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html

The Solicitation is anticipated to be release within the next 2 - 3 weeks on the NREL website listed above.

If a solicitation is issued, it may be issued under a new solicitation number.<BR>	<BR>CECOM Contracting Center, on behalf of Program Management Aircraft Survivability Equipment is seeking information to identify possible solutions for a Hostile Fire Detection System (HFDS) that detects, identifies and locates threat systems in real time that can meet the requirements identified by the Draft System Performance Specification (Attachment 01 of the IBOP Restricted Document Library), and Draft Interface Control Document (ICD) (Attachment 02 on the IBOP).  Interested sources are requested to submit comments and/or questions regarding the draft documents using the supplied HFDS RFI Comment Form (Attachment 03 on the IBOP).  Performance comments should be related to proposed improvements and/or clarifications to the Draft System Performance Specification that will facilitate a more efficient HFDS procurement. Interface Control comments should address the technical approaches contained in the Draft HFDS ICD associated with the interfaces.  Interested parties are encouraged to respond to the HFDS questionnaire (Attachment 04 on the IBOP), as well.  Attachment 03 submittals are due no later than close of business on 11 August 2010. Attachment 04 submittals are due no later than close of business on 30 September 2010. <BR><BR>Background/Objective<BR><BR>Army aircraft lacks a hostile fire detection system for operating within the current threat environment.  Currently, aircrews are the sole source of hostile fire identification.  The inability to accurately identify enemy weapon system engagements decreases the overall survivability of the aircraft, reduces mission success, and the ability to redirect fire against enemy targets.  Therefore, Congress, through the Secretary of Defense, has directed the Army to seek a HFDS solution.  <BR><BR>The fundamental purpose of the HFDS is to notify aircrews that they are being engaged by hostile fire weapon systems.  The HFDS will be developed in three increments.  Increment 1 will develop the capability to detect and declare, determine a projectiles proximity to the aircraft, locate the threat at a clock position, and warn the aircrew; the first increment will also serve as the foundation for increments 2 and 3.  Increment 2 will add threat classifications.  Increment 3 will add geolocation of threat source and automated countermeasures.  Each increments design will enable major subcomponents to connect in a Modular Open Systems approach (MOSA) format and facilitate an integrated aircraft survivability equipment (IASE) System.  It is the Governments desire to equip several rotary wing, if not all, aviation platforms with this capability.  Therefore, the system must be able to interoperate with legacy ASE and avionic systems as well as be used on avionic bussed and non-bussed aircraft.<BR><BR>This Request for Information (RFI) announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information provided may be used by the U.S. Army in developing its acquisition strategy, performance specifications and assessing technology maturity.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to negotiate/award a purchase order to Beckman Coulter, 250 South Kraemer Blvd., Brea, CA 92822, for the purchase of a Biomek FXP A318444 and a Biomek NXP A31841. 

Several aspects of the Beckman system comprising the Biomek FXP and Biomek NXP units make it unique. Their modular-based platforms are designed to accommodate a variety of sample throughput in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well formats. Specifically, the liquid handling platform will have one 384-channel head with a gripping unit, a second arm with 8 independent pipetting probes, and a single arm with one 96-channel head with a gripping unit. The 384 and 96 multichannel heads maintain pipetting accuracies of 3% CV at volumes of 1 L. Both 384 and 96 well heads can be changed to the other head type, allowing us to ramp the capacity of our liquid handling operations if required for specific operations. The 8-channel variable spanning head is capable of independent tip liquid level detection, and offers fixed probe or disposable pipette tip options. It is also able to access microplate and non-microplate well-to-well dimensions, providing extreme flexibility. The span 8 probes are able to pipette 1 L with accuracies of 3% CV. The span 8 also has the capability to include a solvent/solution selection system in order to change between up to 6 different solutions within a method.

The system is designed to accommodate a variety of tube and plate formats, such as deep-well plates, PCR plates, reservoirs, and tubes in racks. This flexibility is critical to accommodate a wide variety of operations, including preparation of samples for real-time PCR analysis of active siRNAs. A variety of tip type options are also available for normal and low volume pipetting from a variety of vendors including 20 L, 30 L, 50 L, 100 L, 200 L and 1000 L tips. The system also provides user safety by offering a laser light curtain. This light curtain allows for complete work area accessibility while still providing operator safety. The liquid handler also includes a means for self-calibration with a laser system to allow for quick and easy calibration and not require teaching. Furthermore, the liquid handling system is capable of being integrated with external labware storage and other devices. 

An especially important feature of this system is that the liquid handling software is extremely user-friendly and adaptable for the novice or advanced user. The software has predefined and validated methods that are applicable to our operations (e.g., methods to extract nucleic acid for real-time PCR analysis and plasmid purification). The software also has three independent steps that function in concert to handle the most challenging parts of a hit picking process, including Hitpicking Setup (this determines the wells to transfer and assigns sources to destinations), Data Driven Transfer (liquid transfer), and Hitpicking Leftovers (this creates a record of any hits not transferred during the method). This software has options for volume splitting and specialized tip handling into a highly configurable user interface that allow our input files to direct the hit picking operation. Further, the ability to specify destination plates and wells, and individual transfer volumes from the hit file are essential. 

No other platform offers all of the critical features described in detail above. Specifically, no other comparably priced system can offer simultaneous and independent 384 and 96 well head operations, robust hit-picking and arraying, self calibration, pre-defined and validated protocols that are relevant to our needs, and user friendly software that has previously been used by current group members. 

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325188 and the Size Standard is 100 Employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-HG-2010-247-RSF may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6145, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee, by fax transmission to (301)480-3345 or by email to ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to negotiate/award a purchase order to Sigma-Aldrich, 3050 Spruce Street, St. Louis, MO, 63103, for the design and testing of custom zinc finger nuclease.

Sigma-Aldrich currently holds exclusive commercial rights to generate zinc-finger nucleases to target specific genes in Zebrafish.  The technology was initially developed by Sangamo Biosciences and has been licensed to Sigma-Aldrich for sale to the research community. 
NHGRI Zebrafish Core provides services to NHGRI researchers that facilitate analysis of genes involved in human genetic diseases using zebrafish as a model system.  To this effect, NHGRI has been performing targeted re-sequencing of ENU-mutagenized males (TILLING) for identification of mutations.  This technology is limited by the number of males screened and the size of the exons as ENU generates mutations throughout the genome randomly.  Therefore, for genes where TILLING has not identified knockout mutations, zinc-finger nuclease technology can be used for specific targeting.  Therefore, Zebrafish Core is ordering zinc-finger nucleases for 2 genes.

Contractor Requirements:

-Sigma- Aldrich  will perform the following tasks:
-Design ZFN pairs for genes identified by the Core
-Assemble ZFP modules
-Attach DNA-cleaving Nuclease
-Transfect in a cell line to validate designed ZFN candidates by mismatch sensitive nuclease assay
-Prepare mRNA from the ZFN pair with highest DNA-cleavage efficiency
-Provide plasmids and mRNA from validated ZFN pairs to the Core.

Government Responsibilities:

NHGRI will provide Sigma-Aldrich with information on two target genes. Sigma-Aldrich will keep NHGRI informed of progress on design, assembly and validation phases until the products are delivered to us.  

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.

<DESC>Fiber Channel Airborne Test Systems (FCATS) components, quantity 5 each, with the option for 2 additional FCATS. FCATS are precise systems used in aircraft testing to record time-stamped radar data that will be utilized in F/A-18 aircraft and existing laboratories and test facilities.
The FCATS consist of the following components manufactured by TTC: (1) AIM-4006-1: Airborne Instrumentation Multiplexer with Power Supply, Motherboard and Metalwork; (2) OVH-350-1: AIM-2004 or AIM-400X Overhead card with two GbE; (3) RCI-305-2: AIM/HSAVDAU Remote CAIS Interface Card; (4) FCR-302L-4: Dual-Channel Fibre Channel Card, 62.5 x 125 um Optics, 1 Gbps Line Rate, DAR V3 Recording Format, Receive Only mode; (5) nREC-6000-1: Network Based Recorder with two 1-Gigabit Ethernet channels, one 10/100 Base-T Ethernet port, RS232/422 port, Power supply, and Media Storage receptacle; (6) NSW-8GT-D: Gigabit Airborne Network Ethernet Switch 8 Ports with 10/100/1000 base-T electrical inputs; (7) MSA-1024SC-1: Media Storage Array consisting of 8 each 128 Gigabyte solid state storage cartridges; (8) OXB-101A-1: Standalone Single Channel Active Optical Splitter.
This is a noncompetitive contract action. The intended source is Teletronics Technology Corporation (TTC). The Government aircraft, laboratory, and test facilities are current using TTC FCATS components and any new source would require significant Government reinvestment in training and equipment; moreover, flight clearances have already been obtained for the TTC part numbers mentioned, and the use of any parts not obtained from TTC would require new flight clearances to be obtained. This would cause substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay.
Delivery schedule is 60 days after award of contract. Destination is China Lake, CA. 
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered. Responses to submit capability statements shall be submitted no later than 9 Aug 2010.
See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has identified a need for technical services to assist NSWCCD engineers in assessing the capabilities of current and near-future actuator and sensor technologies for use in measuring mechanical impedances onboard ships. Code 7220 is the Structural Acoustic and Target Strength Research Branch in the Signature Control Technology Division of the Signatures Department and is involved in directing research and development work toward new or improved submarine components. Actuators and sensors are needed for measuring mechanical impedances of submarine components.Actuator and sensor technologies cover a wide range of electro-mechanical materials, mechanisms, and attachment conditions.  Example actuator technologies are moving armature shakers (single-point attachments) and piezoceramics stacks (two-point intrastructural attachments). Example sensor technologies are accelerometers (single-point) and piezoelectric strips. Assessment criteria for actuators include blocked force level, latency, power efficiency, bandwidth, linearity, robustness, reliability, environmental sensitivity, manufacturability, and cost. Assessment criteria for sensors include sensitivity, latency, linearity, bandwidth, robustness, reliability, environmental sensitivity, manufacturability, and cost.To acquire the needed services, NSWCCD intends to conduct a non-competitive procurement with Summit Applied Research (SAR), Summit, NJ 07901.  SAR is currently the only vendor with experience in the design, development, installation, and operation of distributed sensors and high-power, high-force, low latency actuators in a harsh undersea operational environment. Summit High-power actuators as envisioned for the project require high current switch-capacitor technology of the kind developed by SAR for specialized Navy application. SAR is also the only vendor, past or present, with the knowledge of the particular naval architecture needed to perform this work. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. All submissions received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Please reference RFQ N00167-10-T-0114 with all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Background: Solicitation H92222-09-R-0002 for the Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM) Mk 1 program was cancelled on 14 April 2010. This synopsis is for new, stand alone, requirements that have been developed since the cancellation. There will be NO reference between these new requirements and Solicitation H92222-09-R-0002. The program name for the new requirements remains Combatant Craft, Medium Mk 1 under the new solicitation number H92222-10-R-0037. The following information provides the new top level requirements for this craft and additional requirements will be included in the new solicitation. The Government will not entertain questions regarding the change from the old requirements to the new requirements.
<p><br />Description: The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)Combatant Craft Medium Program Management Office (CCM PMO) is pursuing solutions for the design/build of Special Operations Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM) Mk 1 systems (craft, trailer, prime mover). The CCM Mk 1 craft will replace the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) as a utilitarian go-to-war craft without the design constraints of C-130 internal air transport or airdrop. The primary mission of CCM Mk 1 is insertion/extraction of Special Operations Forces (SOF) in medium threat environments. The CCM Mk 1 will support other core SOF tasks to include direct action; special reconnaissance; combating terrorism; foreign internal defense; unconventional warfare; preparation of the environment; combating narco-terrorism; personnel recovery; and visit, board, search, and seizure.</p>
<p>This is a 100% small business set-aside. The Government is interested in existing technologies that meet the stated requirements with the ability to increase the craft's capability through implementation of innovative solutions throughout the life cycle. <br />&emsp;<br />General Note: The terms "threshold" and "objective" are used throughout this document. Threshold is defined as the minimum acceptable operational value. Objective is defined as the desired operational value beyond which any gain in utility does not warrant additional expenditure.</p>
<p>Budget Information: The Government's design to cost (DTC) philosophy is based on budgetary DTC targets and a performance cost metric (PCM). The DTC targets for the prototype system and the production system will be provided in the RFP. The PCM is defined as: Performance Cost Metric equals the fuel consumption rate divided by the product of the variable payload times the average cruise speed. The target PCM will be specified in the RFP.</p>
<p>Fuel consumption rate is in gallons per hour measured at an average cruise speed in four foot combined seas. Variable payload is in tons. Average cruise speed is in knots measured over the threshold range in four foot combined seas. Average cruise speed is achieved at the maximum continuous rating for the propulsion diesel engines as defined and warranted by the original equipment manufacturer. <br /><br />The fabrication of prototype craft, trailer, and prime mover system and support of Government testing will be executed via a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract line item. The fabrication of the production craft, trailer, and prime mover systems will be executed via Firm-Fixed-Price contract line items.</p>
<p>Program Timeline/Strategy: A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) release is anticipated in September 2010. RFP responses will be due on or about 90 days after release. Parent craft with identical hull form and propulsion systems as the proposed CCM Mk 1 solutions will be required for Government testing for those Offerors determined to be in the competitive range. Multiple contract awards for test article system fabrication and testing are planned in fourth quarter fiscal year 2011. The number of awards is contingent upon receipt of acceptable contractor proposals and available funding. Selected contractor(s) will be required to deliver a CCM Mk 1 test article system for Government testing within 12 months after contract award. Results of testing will be used to select a single contractor for CCM production and logistics support. Projected craft production is for 30 craft. Projected contract length is ten (10) years.</p>
<p>Notes: <br />1. Offerors will be limited to one proposal for this requirement. <br />2. An Offeror submitting a proposal as a prime may not be a subcontractor on another proposal as long as it is in competition for award as the prime. <br />3. There will be no draft RFP. However, the Contracting Officer will post questions and answers after the RFP is published to facilitate proposal development.</p>
<p>Industry Day: In an effort to improve the formal RFP, the Government will hold a one-to-two day Industry day. The Government will announce the date, location, and agenda no less than two weeks prior to hosting the event.</p>
<p>Craft Requirements (Test Article and Production): The craft, trailer, and prime mover shall be capable of internal air transport on C-17 and larger aircraft (threshold = objective). There is no airdrop or tactical transport requirement.</p>
<p>The average cruise speed, range, variable payload, and personnel capacity requirements will be specified in the RFP. However, the threshold requirement for each are bounded between the specific NSW RIB and Mk V Special Operations Craft (SOC) capabilities provided below:</p>
<p>NSW RIB<br />Personnel Capacity: Three crew and nine passengers<br />Range: 200 NM<br />Cruise Speed: 32 knots (Sea State 2)<br />Variable Payload: 3200 pounds (excluding fuel)</p>
<p>Mk V SOC<br />Personnel Capacity: Six crew and 15 passengers<br />Range: 600 NM<br />Cruise Speed: 40 knots (Sea State 3)<br />Variable Payload: 10,000 pounds (excluding fuel)</p>
<p>Variable payload for the CCM Mk 1 is defined as the weight of crew and passengers plus the weight of mission specific equipment. Average crew and passenger weight is 300 pounds each and includes personal gear worn by the operators (e.g., body armor, weapon). Mission specific equipment includes, but is not limited to, such items as weapons, ammunition, passenger seating (if used), and/or combat rubber raiding craft (CRRC). Variable payload does not include fuel.</p>
<p>The crew and passengers will be wearing Level 4 ballistics protection; operational gear; and standard issue chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosive (CBRNE) personnel protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>The craft shall be designed with a service life growth margin to accommodate weight of future upgrades. The service life growth margin will be a percentage of full load displacement and will be specified in the RFP.</p>
<p>The craft's anticipated operational usage is 250 hours per year and the craft shall have a service life of five years (threshold) and seven years (objective).<br /><br />The craft shall encompass both low detectability and low vulnerability characteristics. The optimum balance of technical characteristics will satisfy performance requirements as well as specific survivability requirements that will be discussed in a classified attachment to the RFP. The RFP will include Government lessons learned and technical data dealing with low observable craft design.</p>
<p>The craft shall have Tactical Computers (TCs). The TCs will initially control and interface with the tactical radios. Future integration of the TCs with other craft systems (e.g., electric plant / Power Distribution System (PDS), seaframe systems, navigation systems, intercom system, Combatant Craft - Forward Looking InfraRed (CC-FLIR), and Automated Weapon Mount) will be accomplished via incremental or evolutionary development. The TCs must be initially designed to allow for this expanded future capability and must utilize an open-standards based computing environment. Seaframe systems will consist mainly of the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus connected subsystems aboard the craft, such as the engines and propulsion components. Navigation systems will consist of the radar, heading sensors, depth sounders, Automated Identification System (AIS), and Global Positioning System (GPS). Overall system architecture shall comply with DoD Information Assurance requirements.</p>
<p>The craft shall have four crew workstations. Each workstation shall consist of a user interface to the TCs. User interfaces shall consist of a display and input devices.</p>
<p>The craft's navigation and seaframe system data shall be displayed at the crew workstations independent from the TCs.</p>
<p>The system (craft, trailer, prime mover) shall optimize the following within the given cost, schedule, and technical requirements:</p>
<p>A human exposure for accumulated spine stress dose normalized to an eight hour exposure (Sed8) is expected to be no more than 4.7MPa. Eight-hour operating profile may include as many as five hours at the specified cruise condition (40 knots in four foot combined seas). Sed8 values shall be based on ISO 2631 Part 5 Health Hazard Assessment for Repeated Impacts.</p>
<p>A mission reliability of no less than 80% is expected. Mission reliability is defined as the probability of success in completing a single 11-hour mission during a 48-hour operational mission cycle without experiencing a mission critical failure. A mission critical failure is a failure that occurs before or during an operational mission such that the mission must be aborted, or would have been aborted had the failed item not been repaired or replaced.</p>
<p>A materiel availability of not less than 65% is expected. Materiel availability is defined as the number of CCM Mk 1 systems ready for tasking divided by the total CCM Mk 1 systems in the inventory. As an example, at the full operational capability inventory of 30 craft there may be eight craft deployed, eight craft in squadron introduction training, eight craft in unit level training, and six craft in maintenance. Given that the six craft in maintenance are not ready for tasking, twenty of the remaining twenty-four craft must be ready for tasking to meet the minimum expected 65% materiel availability for all 30 craft.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Equipment: The craft shall accommodate the installation / operation of the following Government Furnished Equipment (GFE):</p>
<p>Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Qty 1<br />Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), Qty 1 <br />Blue Force Tracker (BFT), Qty 1<br />Tactical Radios: AN/PSC-5D, Qty 4 (to be phased replaced with AN/PRC-117G) AN/PRC-150, Qty 1</p>
<p>Interface control documentation for GFE will be provided in the RFP.</p>
<p>Sustainment: The Government's goal is to sustain the CCM Mk 1 system via the Offeror's designed and executed performance based logistics process, which will be the mechanism for ensuring mission reliability, maintainability, and service life requirements are achieved.</p>
<p>Security Clearance: The solicitation/contract will contain a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and a classified attachment. Responders are alerted now that they must meet facility and personnel security clearance requirements for handling and storage of classified material up to SECRET level in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) in order to be granted access to the classified attachment at the time of RFP release. USSOCOM will not provide sponsorship for obtaining necessary security clearances.</p>
<p>Data Rights: The Government will require Government purpose license rights.</p>

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) ONLY as defined in FAR 15.201(e). It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does it commit the Government to make purchase of any supplies or services now or in the future. The information sought and provided will be used for planning purposes only (FAR 52.215-3). In addition, all documentation or information marked proprietary will be handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Please be advised that all submissions become property of the Government and will not be returned. ARPC will not be held responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This RFI is open to all business concerns that are qualified under North American Industry Class System (NAICS) code 561499.
<p><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Headquarters Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC), located in Denver, CO is a major command direct reporting unit (DRU) of Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The Center was established Nov 1, 1953, as Detachment 1, Headquarters Continental Air Command, to centralize the custody and maintenance of master personnel records of Reserve Airmen not on extended active duty. Throughout its history, ARPC has changed its designation and increased involvement in all areas of personnel management, but records management for Air National Guard and Reserve Airmen remains a primary responsibility. In 1997, when the Air Force Reserve Command was established, ARPC was assigned to AFRC as a DRU continuing the history of dedication to serving Citizen Airmen in sustainment of the Total Force.</p>
<p>ARPC will move in May 2011 timeframe to Buckley AFB, CO (10 miles down the road). There is an immediate need to convert the microfiche records to digital media by March 2011 to ensure minimize storage space at the new facility.</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to (1) seek sources with the technical capabilities to convert microfiche to electronic TIF images, (2) identify socio-economic status for a determination of potential set-asides for the procurement, and (3) obtain budgetary information for fiscal planning purposes. Sources are urged to limit marketing material in order to provide more substantive information in their response.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS SCOPE</p>
<p>ARPC has approximately 4 million documents on microfiche which must be converted to electronic TIF image format at 300 DPI. Simple indexing is required, i.e. images need to be indexed by social security number (SSN) for each individual military member's record. Scanned documents/records must be readily located by SSN.</p>
<p>Microfiche Specifications/Data<br />4x6 mylar film cards/jacketed<br />35mm images reduced to 24:1 ratio<br />Hand-mounted images<br />60 images per fiche card capability<br />Average of five fiche types (document type category) per SSN<br />144,035 SSN (average 28 documents per SSN)<br />One document = 1.5 images<br />Images estimated = 6 million</p>
<p>A visual representation of the microfiche is at Attachment 1 here.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The government requests only responses that describe specific experience related to scanning and simple indexing of Privacy Act type records. Interested sources are requested to provide an information package consisting of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Title Page clearly marked RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - RECORDS MANAGEMENT MICROFICHE with the date of submission, respondent's contracting and technical points of contact along with electronic mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers.</p>
<p>(2) A two-page profile of your company, including product and service offerings, current Government contracts (include contract # and customer), current socio-economic status under NAICS Code 561499, e.g. certified small business, 8(a), HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, veteran owned, small disadvantaged business, service disabled veteran owned.</p>
<p>(3) A technical capabilities statement limited to no more than five (5) double-spaced pages describing corporate experience and/or past performance related to scanning and simple indexing of Privacy Act type records in the following areas:</p>
<p>Please cite the customer, contract effort, including contract number, brief description of work and total dollar value, and indicate whether your firm participated as the prime or subcontractor. REMINDER: The government requests only responses that describe specific experience related to scanning and simple indexing of Privacy Act type records.</p>
<p>(4) Ten (10) page, single spaced, minimum 12 point Times New Roman (or equivalent) information paper providing your response to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Commercial Services Defined - services of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices for specific tasks or outcomes to be achieved under commercial terms and conditions. What percentage of firm's business is government versus non-government? Are the firm's rates published? Are discounts available and if so, under what quantities and/or conditions?</p>
<p>b. DVD or hard drive - Is it more cost effective to convert onto a hard drive versus DVDs? Why? What are your recommendations for back-up coverage?</p>
<p>c. Describe how quality control will be accomplished. ARPC must validate accomplishment of the task before disposal of microfiche. Describe the firm's processes and procedures for safeguarding Privacy Act records at your facility and during transport to and from ARPC's Denver facility to the firm's facility.</p>
<p>d. Provide a timeline for transporting the 4 million microfiche to your facility/location, accomplishing the conversion work and returning the electronic media to ARPC no later than 31 March 2011</p>
<p>e. Schedule (time) is a critical requirement. Describe any work performed with an aggressive deadline as a requirement?</p>
<p>f. ARPC has a continuing need for access to the data on the microfiche to continue daily operations including retirements and member re-assignments. The average number of requests for data is 100 per month. How long will it take to accomplish all the work for 4 million microfiche? With an estimated 100 requests per month for access to the data, is it possible to accomplish the requirement by 31 March 2011? What methods or procedures, if any, could be put in place for ARPC access to the records data within 24-48 hours of a request?</p>
<p>g. ARPC may need to continue the full indexing operation at the Denver facility requiring an incremental delivery schedule. Please provide an estimated production capability on a weekly, bi-monthly, monthly basis. Are there cost drivers to consider using this approach? Percentage or dollar-wise, how much more would it cost for incremental delivery?</p>
<p>h. Provide a budgetary estimate for accomplishing the work in accordance with the specifications (see Requirements Scope above) and 31 March 2011 deadline. Pricing should include conversion cost per image (scan and simple index) for both DVD and hard drive, transportation cost to/from Denver (ARPC will have microfiche boxed for transport), and if requested, destruction of microfiche (in accordance with AFI 33-332 Air Force Privacy Act Program, dated 29 January 2004, Chapter 10, Protecting and Disposing of Records, rather than return microfiche to ARPC for destruction.</p>
<p>Please send requested information by e-mail only (Microsoft Word<sup>TM</sup> or .pdf attachments are preferred) as soon as possible but no later than 4 PM Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) on&nbsp;3 August 2010. Information packages and all inquiries shall be emailed to Jacqueline Rogers at jacqueline.rogers@us.af.mil .</p>
<p>All information received in response to this notice will be marked PROPRIETARY and handled accordingly. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable government regulations. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the results. This RFI does not constitute any obligation on the government with a specific source; however, the government does anticipate a solicitation and possible award of a firm requirement by 30 September 2010.</p>

<DESC>The 21st Space Wing, Peterson AFB, CO has a remote installation located at Thule Air Base, Greenland which is the United States Air Force's northernmost base located at (76 320 North latitude by 68 500 West longitude). The base is located 695 miles north of the Arctic Circle and 947 miles south of the North Pole on the Northwest side of the island. Thule has approximately 7,500 tons of scrap metal with potential recycle value in various sizes which needs to be removed and recycled. The contractor would be responsible for all labor, transportation, licensing, bonding, insurance, equipment, and transportation required to ship the material to a recycling facility.
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement but a survey to locate potential sources to remove the scrap metal at Thule AB, Greenland. In accordance with international agreements with the Danish government, this requirement must first be offered to Danish and Greenlandic companies. If there are no Danish/Greenlandic companies showing interest, then the requirement will be opened up to US companies, therefore US companies are encouraged to provide information as well.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran owned small business, hubzone, 8(a), small disadvantage business, small business, or large business) relative to NACIS 423930 (size standard of $8.8 million). Reponses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>Response to this notice shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. Name, address, telephone #, point of contact, and the size of your business.<br />2. A service capability statement.<br />3. Three customer references to which you have provided similar services.<br />4. Copies of applicable licensing and any product catalogs(s). <br />5. The Government is looking to recycle this metal and as such generate revenue. With that in mind, please list the potential markets for this scrap steel.<br />6. For each market listed, please provide a snapshot in time for the month of December of the market value of scrap metal.<br />7. Possible type of contract your company would recommend to accomplish this contract. Are there any specific contract types that may result in a "no-bid" decision by your company? <br />8. Based upon the requirement, what length of contract would be most advantageous? <br />9. What workload estimates are necessary to adequately scope the workload associated with this contract? Is there other data the Air Force could provide that would be useful in determining level of service required? What type of data?<br />10. What discounts and payment terms are customarily offered/negotiated on similar contracts?<br />11. What is the risk areas associated with this effort? How should they be mitigated? <br />12. Type of equipment required to accomplish the job.<br />13. Provide information on the shipping port(s) you might use.<br />14. The USAF realizes Thule AB is in a remote and isolated portion of the globe and thus there will be costs associated with taking this scrap metal to the recycling markets. Therefore, as part of this sources sought interested parties shall provide an idea of this cost. This shall be represented as an estimated percentage decrease (or range) from the market index for the scrap metal. For example, proposed market index for scrap steel in December 2009 is US $110/ton and you estimate a 15% - 25% reduction in this index to cover the cost of taking this material to market. Thus, the net income USAF might expect is US $82 - US$93/ton. Note: These are budgetary estimates. Final numbers will be requested with an official bid. The scrap and miscellaneous metals will be un-segregated and unprepared, with no more than 10% by weight consisting of other materials (wood, glass, rubber, plastic, concrete, etc).<br /><br />Important facts:</p>
<p>1. The description of the scrap metal pile is as follows:</p>
<p>- Pipe diameters vary from 4 inch to 16 inch and it is all standard weight or SCH 40 <br />- Pipe lengths vary with most around 20 ft and there are welded flanges, bends, tees, and a few valves attached <br />- Steel plate thickness is about 70% (by area) 1/4 inch, 10% 1/2 inch, 10%<br />5/8 inch and 10% 3/4 inch<br />- Steel plate size vary with maximum dimensions around 10 ft<br />- Each tank was 2.5 million U.S. gallons; Number of tanks already torn down 26<br />- Tank height was 40'<br />- Tank diameter was 100'<br />- Tank wall thickness was: Bottom 1/3 - 1", mid 1/3 - 3/4", top 1/3 - 1/2"<br />- There are various 12" and 16" inlet/outlet/transfer pipeline pieces along with both 12" and 16" valves from the tanks and pipeline.</p>
<p>Original tank dimensions were 100 ft diameter and 40 ft height with a conical roof. We have about 2,100 tons of piping and 5,200 tons of scrap from the tanks, a total of 7,300 tons.</p>
<p>Other Important Facts:</p>
<p>1. The only means to remove the scrap metal from Thule AB is via ship or air. <br />2. Due to the weather conditions at Thule, outdoor work normally needs to be accomplished between May to September. During this period, May, Jun, and July, and most of August will have 24 hours of daylight. <br />3. Due to the weather the dock is generally open from Jun through mid September. <br />4. The Pier is capable of receiving large ships and is located approximately 1 mile away on improved dirt road from the scrap pile. There are no roads or rail service out of Thule AB.<br />5. The airport is also located approximately 1 mile away from the scrap pile. <br />6. Contractor will be required to provide all of the required equipment to transport the scrap metal to the pier for loading onto the ship, which will be coordinated with the onsite contractor. <br />7. Two Danish ships come to Thule AB to off-load supplies. They depart and return to the port in Aalborg Denmark. The first ship arrives at the beginning of July and the second ship arrives in Aug. There is a charge associated with transporting items on these ships. <br />8. One American ship comes to Thule AB to off-load supplies. It departs and returns to Norfolk, Virginia and normally arrives at Thule AB in mid July.<br />9. Lodging is available on Thule for approximately $35.00 per night, food for approximately $9.00 per day, and a rental car for approximately $100.00 per day. <br />10. All questions need to be provided in writing. For Danish/Greenlandic interested parties: Contact Patrick King via email at patrick.king@det1.dk and for US interested parties contact David Sonnenberg via email at david.sonnenberg@peterson.af.mil or Renata Ott via email at renata.ott@peterson.af.mil.<br />11. If required, a site visit can be arranged for any interested contractor at no cost to the Government.</p>

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for the Suicide Hotline: Be a Hero Save a Hero Innovation, #247 VHA/OI&T.

Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program. VA intends to retain its "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect. VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions. These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.

The Suicide Hotline: Be a Hero Save a Hero project is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation. Currently, the VA operates a Veterans Suicide Hotline that provides crisis intervention and counseling for veterans (patients). Patients are not able to access the suicide hotline because they do not remember the telephone number. VA learned in a brief survey of the patients accessing the VA medical center's emergency department that patients were not aware of the suicide hotline; it's slogan or telephone number. Comments from patients included:

1.	 "The number is on my refrigerator"
2.	"I can't find it in my wallet"
3.	 "I would like to have it on my cell phone" 
4.	"I don't know where it is at"

The goal of the innovation is to increase the awareness and availability of the suicide hotline and contact information. This will be completes through a VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) alert to VA healthcare providers to actively engage with patients and discuss the VA's Suicide Hotline, to be developed locally as well as the identification and purchase of software and/or services to allow VA employees to send the Suicide Hotline number to Veterans cell phones, smart phones, etc. 

Requirements
Purchase services and/or software to provide the capabilities to transmit the Suicide Hotline number to Veterans (and caretakers) cell phones, smart phones, etc. This will be done at least monthly to the patient's who opt in. It will include the Cincinnati VA telephone number as well as a changing inspirational message. Patients who are at high risk for suicide may be texted more often and kept in a different sub group.

Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information. The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 10 pages.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of providing the below Pad Reactor System and accessories.

The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ). 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBIs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 811219 with a size standard $7.0 / per annum. 

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide

Background Information

NHLBI, DIR has numerous microscopes, imaging systems and components purchased from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc... The Zeiss service plans are necessary for continuation of microscopy in the labs in our Institute. This service plan will maintain image quality from the current Zeiss imaging system, which will allow for continued research productivity from the NHLBI labs.
Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement

The objective of this procurement is to provide on-site maintenance of Zeiss equipment. This group service plan, covering all of the Zeiss confocal and multi-photon imaging systems purchased in the Division, results in a group discount for each system. Zeiss equipment is proprietary, and any technician must be certified by Zeiss, as they are the only company that can provide the parts which may be needed for replacement of worn/damaged components. The option years are put into place to avoid any lapsed time of the service agreement. None of the instruments can be down for any period of time as usage is high for ongoing experiments within the labs. 


Contractor Requirements
Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) to perform the work set forth below.
All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).

The Contractor shall confirm or demonstrate the operations of the equipment according to the performance specifications.

Service shall include the following: 

	Scheduled and Emergency service performed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:.00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. holidays;

	One (1) preventive maintenance inspection per Service Agreement per year
	Telephone response time to schedule a time and date for the service repair: 4 hours. On-site service typically performed in 24 hours.
	All replacement parts, except consumable items, applications support, and software upgrades when available. Work shall be performed by a factory trained representative with documentation certified by Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. Vendor must show proof of legal access to Zeiss software licenses.




Government Responsibilities
The NHLBI will make a good faith effort to make The Equipment available and accessible to the Contractor, and to convey diagnostic and error messages to facilitate service. The NHLBI will make a good faith effort to operate the Equipment according to manufacturer specifications.

Reporting Requirements
The Contractor shall provide a written summary report of the services provided at the conclusion of each unscheduled visit and each preventive maintenance service rendered. The Service Summary Report shall include a time-to-response, a summary of the problem, a summary of the service(s) performed, and the corrective action taken, a summary of the parts, and a quality assurance statement certifying that the system, referred to as The Equipment, is fully operational.

Inspection and Acceptance
Operability of The Equipment is to be inspected and approved by the Project Officer upon contractor completion of service and/or maintenance. These inspections will be completed within one (1) business day of service completion. The Project Officer will assure that the Equipment is maintained at Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) standards and at a minimum of 95% operating condition.

A review of the services provided in the Statement of Work will be conducted annually by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: The Coast Guard is seeking sources to provide components of the HC-144A aircraft APS-143 Radar system manufactured by Telephonic. All data for the components is proprietary. The U.S. Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide specifications, plans, drawings or other technical data. The USCG must make awards to the aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) as they are the only source known with the proprietary drawings and data rights necessary to maintain configuration control of the aircraft. The HC-144A APS-143 Radar receiver transmitter part number 737-4000-001 and signal processor part number 737-3000-001 are solicited by OEM part number thus no substitutions will be given consideration. No substitutions of firmware or software versions shall be authorized. Reconditioned/Used Material is not acceptable.
<p>Suppliers shall be able to provide necessary certifications including traceability to the OEM to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on an U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Traceability means that the supplier must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product or repair. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally, detail if the repairs/overhauls your company has completed on similar APUs has been qualified for use in any Department Of Defense (DoD) or Federal Government Aircraft. The USCG believes the applicable NAICS code is 336412 - Aircraft engine repair and overhauling. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.

This is a follow-on effort to 55th CONS contract FA4600-06-D-0002, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the local Steelcase authorized distributer. This effort will be a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) BPA with an ordering period from date of award to 12 Mar 2014, and an estimated ceiling of $5,000,000. Award will be pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(b)(1), which allows for other than full and open competition when purchasing goods through the federal supply schedule.

USSTRATCOM and AFWA currently are furnished with Steelcase and have an inventory of Steelcase furniture. Steelcase replacement parts, panels, etc must match and fit with the existing furniture design. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or capability packages.

<DESC>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY<br />Extraction, Recovery, and Purification Materials &amp; Methods with Silico Titanates
<p>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy's physical security programs, is seeking one or more business partners including, but not limited to the mining, geothermal, and/or mineral extraction field to develop Sandia's novel silico-titanates technology. Sandia is seeking a company or companies to commercially license the technology described in this posting and expects the successful company/companies to engage in the creation of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Sandia to further develop the technology. Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to obtain a license to the intellectual properties for reasonable compensation. It is expected that the company/companies that work with Sandia to develop the novel silico-titanates technology method will promptly incorporate it into a commercial product.</p>
<p>Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, developdistribute, and market the extraction and recovery technology.</p>
<p>The technology includes methods of making &amp; using noval silico-titanates as well as a class of materials related to crystalline silico-titanates (CST) and CST-like materials for the capture, recovery, and purification of high value alkali metals (primarily Cs, Rb, K, and Li) from geothermal brines, brine concentrates, industrial wastes and industrial products. The CST-like materials are notable for their ability to selectively scavenge, concentrate, and purify alkali metals (principally Li, K, Cs, and Rb) from fluids containing only very small concentrations of the target metals and from chemically complex fluids where other dissolved constituents greatly outweigh the metals being sought. Other methods with these compositions shows they are particularly useful for chemical or biochemical reactions or removing radioactive matter and trace metals from a fluid stream.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail to Jenna Esparza by 15 August 2010 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0114, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185, email: jmespar@sandia.gov, phone: 505.844.2204. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice. Include company and contact information as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to the formation of a CRADA or license and subsequent commercialization of this technology. Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost type Research and Development contract to University of Tennessee as a follow-on to contract W912HQ-07-C-0036.  The description of the requirement is as follows:<BR><BR>The services are to further the understanding of BioReD; biomarkers and tools for reductive dechlorination site assessment, monitoring, and management.  Aligned with this purpose, the main objective of this project is to identify biomarkers and develop a suite of nucleic acid-based tools for site assessment and bioremediation monitoring, with an accompanying guidance protocol for tools application and results interpretation.  To overcome the current limitations and more accurately assess, predict, monitor, and manage reductive dechlorination processes at contaminated DoD sites, novel reductive dechlorination biomarker genes must be identified and MBTs and approaches developed that improve the understanding of target gene presence, abundance, and expression, and thus, contaminant detoxification.  The resulting BioReD technology will provide a comprehensive suite of prognostic and diagnostic tools to describe the presence, abundance, and activity of key bacteria contributing to chlorinated ethene detoxification.  The work to date has provided new insights into rdh gene diversity; identified new process-specific biomarkers; generated new understanding of Dhc metabolic networks; and monitored Dhc gene expression and activity.  The objective of this the proposed work is to develop environmentally benign repair processes for the composites used in military applications that eliminate or significantly reduce the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and hazardous waste generated by the current repair processes.  Possible areas to be addressed include but are not limited to: the development of repair resins, repair adhesives with longer shelf lives, and alternative repair techniques.  Proposed solutions must be able to meet or exceed current performance requirements for composite repairs and offer significantly reduced environmental impact.<BR><BR>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation  FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii),  whereas It is necessary to maintain an essential research or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution for the developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific or technical nature in the case of the follow-on for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a cost contract to the University of Tennessee.

52.212-1  INSTRUCTION TO OFFORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS

A.  To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein.  Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.  The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.  (a)  The proposals will be 8 1/2 x 11 paper except for fold-outs used for charts, tables, or diagrams, which may not exceed 11 x 17.  (b)  A page is defined as one face of a sheet of paper containing information.  (c)  Typing shall not be less than 12 pitch.  (d)  Elaborate formats, bindings or color presentations are not desired or required.

52.212-2 -  EVALUATION  COMMERCIAL ITEMS

BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: 
This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' proposal will be evaluated on a basis of technical acceptability, past performance, and price.  Technical acceptibility and past performance are significantly more important than price.  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

A.  Technical Acceptability.  Initially, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  The proposals shall be evaluated against the following subfactors:

(a) Subfactor - All course curricula must be in accordance with Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT) standards and be approved the government.  

(b) Subfactor - Minimum acceptable course curricula Para 3.3.3.2.1 thru Para 3.3.3.2.11 in PWS.

(c) Subfactor - The contractor will provide a minimum of two instructors per class.  

(d) Subfactor - Instructors must meet or exceed trainer qualifications for a Professional Vendor Member in the Association of Challenge Course Technology and have at least 3 years experience on these types of courses. 

B.  Past Performance Assessment.  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment.  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on all offers based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving initial facilitator training and certification course, refresher facilitator training and certification course and certification class and inspection of obstacles course that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offerors ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFAR, MP5315.3, Table 3.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will/will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offerors performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.   In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.  If the lowest priced evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  Please refer to Attachment 2  for Past Performance Assessment questionnaires.

C.  Price Evaluation.  Next, the government shall rank all technically Acceptable and Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable offers by price, including any option prices if applicable.  An offerors proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in Section B by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each.  When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.

D.  If the lowest priced evaluated technically acceptable offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest technical offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.  The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

E.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.	

F.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

Interested vendors shall submit open market quotes for all or none of the CLINs listed.  Partial quotes will not be accepted.

STATEMENT OF WORK
A.	PURPOSE.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Brecksville, Ohio ("VA") requires contractors to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services  to meet the needs of those Veterans.
B.	BACKGROUND.
Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain offers from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals. The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.
C.	SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED
BASIC SERVICES. The contractor shall furnish each Veteran referred for care under this contract with the following basic services:
a.	ROOM AND BOARD: Room and Board to include a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage, and personal linens (pillows, blankets, towels and bed sheets). Meals to include at least three (3) nutritionally adequate meals a day, 7 days a week and availability of nutritious snacks between meals and bedtime for those requiring or desiring additional food, when it is not medically contraindicated.
b.	LAUNDRY FACILITIES: Laundry facilities for residents to do their own laundry or to have laundry done.
1.	 THERAPEUTIC AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES: Therapeutic and Rehabilitative Services needed by each individual Veteran referred for treatment in a plan by the contractor, with input from the Veteran and the VA Homeless Program Coordinator (or designee). Services which the contractor must be able to furnish shall include:  Structured group activities as appropriate - examples include group therapy, social skills training, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, vocational counseling and physical activities as appropriate.
2.	Collaboration with the VA program staff, which will provide supportive psychosocial services.
3.	Individual professional counseling, including counseling on self care skills, adaptive coping skills and, as appropriate, vocational rehabilitation counseling, in collaboration with VA program and community resources.
4.	Assistance to develop responsible living patterns, to maintain an acceptable level of personal hygiene and grooming, and to achieve a more adaptive level of psychosocial functioning, upgraded social skills, and improved personal relationships.
5.	Support for an alcohol/drug abuse-free lifestyle provided in an environment conducive to social interaction and the fullest development of the resident's rehabilitative potential.
6.	Assistance to gain and to apply knowledge of the illness/recovery process in an environment supportive of recovery models.
7.	A program that promotes community interaction.
In addition, the Contractor shall provide treatment and discharge planning reflecting a team assessment of health, social and vocational needs and the involvement of the Veteran, the VA staff and appropriate community resources in resolving problems and setting goals.
An individual case record will be created for each referred Veteran. Case records shall be maintained in security and confidence as required by the Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records (42 CFR part 2) and the Confidentiality of Certain Medical Records (38 USC 7332). Case records and data normally maintained and included in a medical record as a function of compliance with State or community licensing standards will be made available on a need to know basis to appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs staff members involved with the treatment program of the Veterans concerned.
The contractor shall comply with applicable requirements of the Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records (42 CFR Part II) and the Confidentiality of Certain Medical Records (38 USC 7332).
The contractor shall comply with the principles listed in 38 CFR 17.707(b) to provide housing and supportive services in a manner that is free from religious discrimination.
SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES All services shall be provided at no additional charge to the stated daily fixed fee, except for those services specifically stated below to be Supplemental Services.
[INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES, IF ANY, OFFERED BY CONTRACTOR]
D. ADDITIONAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
1. PERSONNEL
The contractor will employ sufficient personnel to carry out the policies, responsibilities, and the program for the facility. There must be, at a minimum, at least one administrative staff member, or designee of equivalent professional capability, on duty on the premises or residing at the house and available for emergencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
The Contractor shall assign to this contract personnel that by certification, education and training are qualified to provide the Basic Services and Supplemental Services required by this SOW.
The Contractor must identify each person functioning as "Key Personnel" under this contract, and provide to the VA a description of the services to be provided by such person, together with a resume summarizing that person's relevant skills and experience.
During the first ninety (90) calendar days of contract performance, the Contractor shall make NO substitutions of key personnel unless the substitution is necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment.

A large 110 kW water boiler manufactured in 1988 had failed many years.  Although a similar boiler is currently in use, the food service program has since been operating without a back up boiler.  The failed boiler is beyond repairs and has been abandoned in-place.

Provide a replacement electric water boiler of the same capacity as the existing.  Provide controls, electircal connections, water and drain piping.  (Existing electric boiler data:  Precision Parts Corporation, Model HWS5412V480-110, Serial Number 9504, Control: 3 steps of 30kW, 1 step of 20 kW).  Boiler must meet a high efficiency rating available at time of purchase. 

Walk-Thru is scheduled for Thursday, March 26th, 2009 at 10:00 a.m.

If needed, site visits will be done by APPOINTMENT ONLY and NO VISITS after Friday, 
March 27th, 2009.

<p>Any other day designated by Federal law, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation.<br />(b) When any such day falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday is observed. Observance of such days by Government personnel shall not be cause for additional period of performance or entitlement to compensation except as set forth in the contract. If the contractor's personnel work on a holiday, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, unless authorized pursuant to an overtime clause elsewhere in the contract.</p>
<p>(c) NGA may close a facility for all or a portion of a business day as a result of -</p>
<p>1) Granting administrative leave to non-essential NGA personnel (e.g., unanticipated holiday);</p>
<p>2) Inclement weather;</p>
<p>3) Failure of Congress to appropriate operation funds;</p>
<p>4) Continuity of Operations (COOP) training exercises;</p>
<p>5) Or any other reason deemed appropriate by the D/NGA.</p>
<p>(d) In such cases, contractor personnel not classified as essential under the contract (i.e., not performing critical round-the-clock services/tasks or who are not already on duty at the facility), shall not report to the facility. Contractor personnel already present shall be dismissed and leave the facility.</p>
<p>(e) Performance of round-the-clock operations: At the direction of the Contracting Officer; the contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to meet requirements of critical tasks already in operation, or scheduled for performance during the period in which NGA employees are dismissed or the facility has been closed prior to the commencement of normal operations. Contractor personnel should contact their respective home offices to determine their company's respective policies on charging contracts during unscheduled closures.<br /><br />It is the contractor's responsibility to pre-determine and disclose its charging practices, which must be in accordance with the FAR and applicable CAS requirements.<br />2.5 NGA 5X52.207-9000 DOD BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (14 APR 2008)</p>
<p>While NGA continues to transform its processes and systems for the geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) mission, the Agency will soon begin an even more visible change: consolidating its Eastern facilities. In accordance with the Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions that became law in November 2005, NGA will consolidate Eastern operations in the Springfield, Virginia area on the Engineer Proving Ground of Fort Belvoir by September 15, 2011. As NGA moves to this "New Campus East," it will close its primary sites in Bethesda, Reston, and the Washington Navy Yard, in addition to relocating smaller NGA functions.</p>
<p>2.6 NGA 5X09.507-9000 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (14 JUN 2004)</p>
<p>(a) The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. The term "person" includes a business organization.</p>
<p>(b) The principles of organizational conflict of interest and descriptions thereof are set forth at FAR Subpart 9.5.</p>
<p>(c) If the Offeror/Contractor is aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined at para&not;graph (a) above, with respect to this procurement, the Offeror/Contractor shall make immediate and full disclosure to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(d) If in the performance of this contract the Contractor discovers a potential organizational conflict of interest with respect to the contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer, which shall include a description of the actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize the conflict. In the event that the Contractor does not disclose a known potential conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default.</p>
<p>(d) If the Contractor is directed by authorized Government personnel by written tasks or verbal directions (in program review or otherwise), to perform service which the Contractor believes to constitute a potential organizational conflict of interest, the Contractor is required to notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the nature of the conflict within ten (10) days after receipt of the Government directive. The Contracting Officer has the sole responsibility for determining whether a conflict does, in fact, exist. No effort shall be expended toward the performance of the services in question until this determination has been made or unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) The Government has the unilateral right to waive one or more of the provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 and this clause, on a case-by-case basis, if it is determined by the Contracting Officer that a waiver is in the best interest of the Government. The Contractor must demonstrate to the Contracting Officer in writing that the Contractor can neutralize, mitigate or eliminate potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>(g) Any restraints negotiated in response to FAR Part 9.507 2 as a condition of award due to an organizational conflict of interest, shall be incorporated into the instant contract. These restraints will have duration of not more than three (3) years after completion of the contract effort.</p>
<p>(h) The Contractor shall insert paragraphs (a) through (g) of this clause in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>2.7 IDENTIFICATION BADGES</p>
<p>(a) It is a requirement of this contract that all Contractor employees have an identification badge properly displayed on his/her person at all time while present at NGA facilities. NGA will issue initial badges, upon receipt of the information identified by the Contracting Officer upon the request of the Contractor, without charge. Lost badges will be replaced at a charge. The Contractor shall return all badges to NGA when an employee leaves the employ of the Contractor, is taken off this project, or upon completion of the contract.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor-owned vehicles or Contractor employee owned vehicles which are to be operated on station must be registered with facility security office.</p>
<p>2.8 PERFORMANCE OF WORK ON GOVERNMENT PREMISES</p>
<p>The rules and regulations, whether in effect now or to go into effect in the future, at the premises where services are to be performed shall apply to the Contractor and its employees while working on the premises. These regulations include, but are not limited to: presenting valid identification for entrance, smoking restrictions, obtaining and using vehicle passes for all Contractor-owned and/or privately owned vehicles, obeying posted directives, strict adherence to security and/or police directives, and safety procedures and directives.<br />2.9 AIS ACCOUNTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall take all steps necessary to ensure that all Government computer accounts assigned to Contractor personnel during the performance of this contract are wholly deleted upon completion or termination of the contract; or, for individual Contractor personnel, upon the removal, reassignment or other departure of such personnel from the contract. (NOTE: Either the Contractor, Contractor's supervisor, or the NGA Contracting Officer (KO) or KO designee, may disable the Contractor's AIS system/network account(s) by contacting and informing the NGA Operational Help Desk (1-800-455-0899) of the Contractor's name, date of the Contractor's departure, and identity of any AIS system/network accounts in which the Contractor had access). In either instance (i.e., cessation of this contract or cessation of individual Contractor personnel's involvement with this contract), the Contractor shall notify the KO or the KO designee in writing that all Government computer accounts assigned to Contractor personnel during the performance of this contract are wholly deleted in accordance with this provision. The above action must be taken by the Contractor within twenty-four (24) hours of cessation of this contract or cessation of the individual Contractor personnel's involvement with this contract.</p>

FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number. Any questions regarding this solicitation must be sent to divya.soni@nist.gov no later than July 21, 2010 at 5pm Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed under unrestricted full and open competition whereby IBM-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.&nbsp; The equipment to be procured is only accessible by service personnel for maintenance, repair and monitoring.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently runs a production environment for the Commerce Business Systems (CBS) software suite, which provides core financial, personnel, property, and travel database and application support to NIST and the Department of Commerce Office of the Secretary. These applications are deemed critical to the operation of the agency. The NIST CBS environment consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM. The particular need being addresses by this procurement is one for increased memory capacity for an IBM pSeries 570 system.</p>
<p>This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items below. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: <br />Description: IBM 32GB (4x8GB DIMMs) DDR1 SDRAM, 208-PIN<br />IBM Part Number: 9117-4492<br />Quantity: 8; EA</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: <br />Description: IBM Services - De-Install 8 x IBM 4454 (8 gig kits) and then install the 8 4x8 IBM 4492 (32 gig kits) listed above. (Installation of the memory shall be performed by IBM Customer Engineers, not non-IBM personnel)</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The NIST CBS environment currently consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM. The capacity upgrade must adhere to the current architecture for compatibility; therefore only IBM p Series hardware and AIX operating environments are acceptable. <br />All responsible offerors that are IBM-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. All products quoted must be in the IBM support database so that support must come from IBM personnel.</p>

Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirements stated below.</p>
<p>Stronger Considerations:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger consideration will be given for a system that provides:</p>
<p>1. Possibilities for IR compensation on one or all electrodes such as:<br />a. Fixed value<br />b. Current interrupt<br />c. Positive feedback compensation</p>
<p>2. Built-in Frequency Response Analyzer to enable Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.</p>
<p>3. Front panel display of instrument status, such as:<br />a. Cell enabled/disabled<br />b. Current or voltage overload condition<br />c. Applied current and potential</p>
<p>4. Automatic optimization of range for current and potential.</p>
<p>5. Noise filters.</p>
<p>6. Size of the buffer for the stored digital signals.</p>
<p>7. Current boosters for each working electrode.</p>
<p>8. Built-in function generator.<br />Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>

<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Olympus America, Inc, 3500 Corporate Parkway, Center Valley, PA 18034 for an Olympus CellTIRF 4G Module with the following accessories:</p>
<p>-	Fiber and Jig, FC8 Connector<br />-	Broadband Fiber and Jig, FC8 Connector<br />-	Control Box - CellTIRF Systems INC Power and Cables<br />-	Parallel Cable to control 4 devices w/4 TTL BNC OUTS<br />-	Quad Laser Set Bandpass Cube<br />-	FL Cube Ex Z442/514D<br />-	MM Premier Online</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Olympus is the only source of the Olympus CellTIRF component that is compatible with the Olympus IX81 currently in place.  An alternative source would require a complete system from other manufacturers to duplicate the Microscope, environmental chamber, and camera that are in the lab.</p>
<p>The instrument also meets the following specifications which are required:</p>
<p>-	The input of four separate and independent fiber optic laser lines.  This allows simultaneous laser lines to be used to maximize speed and capture various cellular interactions with multiple laser lines.<br />-	Independent motorized control of the TIRF angle to set variations of Z depths for different laser lines.<br />-	Independent focus adjustment to maximize performance of the individual laser lines.<br />-	The first line must have a switchable lens element that allows the focused laser spot to be repositioned from the back focal plane to the image plane.  This allows simple and simultaneous photoactivation type experiments.<br />-	Simultaneous widefield and TIRF may be required therefore this combination should utilize a Polarizing beamsplitter to maintain an illumination efficiency of 95% TIRF and 50% widefield.<br />-	Software readout of the individual penetration depths of the individual wavelengths.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 50 South Drive, Bldg 50, Room 3523, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333314, Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing, and is not a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-44 (July 8, 2010).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by July 26, 2010 at 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Affymetrix, 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 for an Affymetrix Maintenance Agreement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI Genomics Core facility provides a full spectrum of services using Affymetrix platform for parallel analyses of genomes and their expression. Applications of this technology include global gene expression profiling, exon analysis to study alternative splicing events, microRNA analysis, and large scale SNP genotyping using the SNP 6.0 chips and mapping sites of protein/DNA interaction using tiling arrays. The primary goals of the core are (1). To provide investigators with high quality, genome analysis service in a timely fashion by rigorous standardization of protocols and multiple quality control checks and (2). To provide streamlined data analysis for identification of signature genes and biomarkers by the application of complex statistical tools. In addition, investigators with high throughput projects are supported by the robotics infrastructure within the facility.  These services are provided to investigators with the use of 3 fluidic stations, one gene chip array station, and a scanner and computer workstation.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the NHLBI Genomics Core facility provides research tools and support to NHLBI investigators on microarray technology, using Affymetrix's oligo arrays. As a central part of its role, the Core provides and maintains Affymetrix equipment including a hybridization oven, fluidics station, Gene chip array work station (GCAS) and GCS 3000 scanner.  The item requested in this purchase is the service contract for the equipment that would be used on a routine basis. In order to maintain a high standard of quality and reproducibility of experiments while increasing data output, these instruments manufactured by Affymetrix has to be performing well and this requires proper maintenance and periodic servicing by Affymetrix trained engineers.  This contract service would provide such maintenance and would also provide immediate repair service by telephone and on site visits as and when needed.</p>
<p>This equipment is proprietary and any technician must be certified by Affymetrix to maintain this equipment.  A written certification must be provided.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Room 8C215, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NCNJ1000-10-15652 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. A long standing challenge for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) goal of advancing the use of GPS for more accurate and efficient processing of hydrographic surveys has been the inability to probe water levels within outbound waterways for differences in the GPS ellipsoidal separation of tidal datum and tidal constituents. An over-arching goal with respect to this challenge is to implement the technological infrastructure and processes to successfully survey to the GPS ellipsoid. Obtaining reliable GPS water level buoys is considered central to achieving this goal. NOAA and NOS has a requirement to procure a GPS water level buoy system deployable from small vessels that is capable of acquiring high accuracy dual-frequency GPS data which can be processed in Post Processed Kinematic (PPK) mode for use in measuring vertical ellipsoidal heights of water levels for hydrographic surveying applications. The primary function of the GPS Water Level Buoy System is to collect accurate three-dimensional water level data. This system shall permit water levels to be determined in post processing. The ability to conduct PPK mode of GPS processing shall be supported by the GPS Water Level System. Delivery of the completed GPS water level buoy and documents shall be within 120 days of receipt of order. Details regarding this requirement are listed in the attached Statement of Work entitled "GPS-Tracked Water Level System Buoy".

The NWS, Services Branch has a requirement to purchase 8 Timewave units (DSP-D300E).
<p>These units (DSP-D300E) allow Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time (ALERT) data to be decoded and sent over the Internet. This, in turns, allows the data to be processed at a NWS facility for display over the Web to the public and dissemination to Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). The ALERT data to be sent is rainfall and stream data collected through the Passaic Flood Warning System (PFWS). The PFWS operates rainfall and stream gages in the Passaic River Basin of New Jersey. The PFWS is operated and maintained by the NWS through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the New York District office of the United States Army Corps Of Engineers (USACE). The PFWS is a 24/7 operation that sends important weather-related data to the NWS for dissemination to NWS field offices for use in issuing watches and warnings.</p>
<p>Timewave is the only company producing a device capable of filtering ALERT radio signals, decoding the ALERT data from these radio signals, and then encapsulating the ALERT data or message in Internet Protocol (IP) for transmission over the Internet. The contractor Timewave built the DSP-D300 for the National Weather Service under a competitive bid. The DSP-D300E meets the needs of the National Weather Service and Timewave, Inc. is the only vendor that produces such a unit.</p>

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.  
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (NAVY)

52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002)

An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed  the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 MAY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 23 MAY 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OTI Program Advisor, worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations management in headquarters and the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The incumbent is considered knowledgeable in the field of political transition programming from headquarters or overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Program Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull; Support implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Support country programs, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field or in Washington, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for extended periods of time if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in country analysis, program design and/or assessments to develop existing and future programs and strategies;</p>
<p>&bull; Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in the design and implementation of new country program operations, including but not limited to management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in responding to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the drafting of internal and external reports,</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, serve as a liaison or provide support for other Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions, the U.S. Department of State, or other U.S. Agencies on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Two 110 kW electric boilers are located in the Food Service Bldg. P mechanical room.&nbsp; One of the two is on-line, functional and in good condition. There is no backup boiler currently. The other is&nbsp;old, corroded, disconnected from service and abandoned in the room. It is the intent of this project to remove the abandoned boiler from the room and replace it with a new 110 kW electric boiler. The new boiler is to be installed, piped and valved, power-wired and control-wired, such that either this boiler or the existing boiler can be chosen to operate while the other is reserved as a backup. The center will develop a schedule to alternate the operation of the two boilers to prevent extended water stagnation and mineral deposits in the boiler, pipes and valves.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number. Any questions regarding this solicitation must be sent to divya.soni@nist.gov no later than July 22, 2010 at 5pm Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed under unrestricted full and open competition whereby IBM-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.&nbsp; The equipment to be procured is only accessible by service personnel for maintenance, repair and monitoring.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently runs a production environment for the Commerce Business Systems (CBS) software suite, which provides core financial, personnel, property, and travel database and application support to NIST and the Department of Commerce Office of the Secretary. These applications are deemed critical to the operation of the agency. The NIST CBS environment consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM. The particular need being addresses by this procurement is one for increased memory capacity for an IBM pSeries 570 system.</p>
<p>This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items below. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: <br />Description: IBM 32GB (4x8GB DIMMs) DDR1 SDRAM, 208-PIN<br />IBM Part Number: 9117-4492<br />Quantity: 8; EA</p>

<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The NIST CBS environment currently consists of IBM p Series servers, and IBM AIX and HA/CMP operating environments. The IBM AIX operating environment requires hardware, microcode, and device drivers that are proprietary and only available from IBM. The capacity upgrade must adhere to the current architecture for compatibility; therefore only IBM p Series hardware and AIX operating environments are acceptable. <br /><br />All responsible offerors that are IBM-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. All products quoted must be in the IBM support database so that support must come from IBM personnel.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations.

(End of clause)<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Any amendment and documents related to this procurement will be available electronically at the Internet site: http://www.fbo.gov.

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a) Definitions.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Questions & Answers for VA-241-10-RQ-0457 July 19, 2010
Third Posting


 
1)	QUESTION: Please define "specimen receipt" - is receipt considered arrival of specimens in our laboratory or specimen pickup at the ordering site? 

Refers to SOW: Mandatory Turnaround Time: Provide results with a TAT of 48 hours from specimen receipt. This is crucial and if an offeror cannot comply with this turnaround time, your offer will not be accepted. If you are an offeror that states you can comply with this turnaround time and then when the test is ordered, it does not turnaround in this timeframe, this will be considered a breach in contract and may be immediately ended.

ANSWER: Specimen receipt in the testing laboratory, not from pick up at ordering site.  It's the "within testing lab" turnaround time.

2)	QUESTION: What is the current pricing?

ANSWER: Not disclosed.

3)	QUESTION: Who is the current vendor?

ANSWER: Not disclosed.

4)	QUESTION: How many specimens are there per location?

ANSWER: It varies.  Please see estimated workload, Section G under SOW, per test, not by location.

5)	QUESTION: Please provide an example of the pickup schedule for each location

ANSWER:  Vendor to provide response.

6)	QUESTION: What are the cutoff levels for each drug?

ANSWER: Vendor to provide response.

The base is located 695 miles north of the Arctic Circle and 947 miles south of the North Pole on the Northwest side of the island. Thule has approximately 7,500 tons of scrap metal with potential recycle value in various sizes which needs to be removed and recycled. The contractor would be responsible for all labor, transportation, licensing, bonding, insurance, equipment, and transportation required to ship the material to a recycling facility.
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement but a survey to locate potential sources to remove the scrap metal at Thule AB, Greenland. In accordance with international agreements with the Danish government, this requirement must first be offered to Danish and Greenlandic companies. If there are no Danish/Greenlandic companies showing interest, then the requirement will be opened up to US companies, therefore US companies are encouraged to provide information as well.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (service disabled veteran owned small business, veteran owned small business, hubzone, 8(a), small disadvantage business, small business, or large business) relative to NACIS 423930 (size standard of $8.8 million). Reponses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>Response to this notice shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. Name, address, telephone #, point of contact, and the size of your business.<br />2. A service capability statement.<br />3. Three customer references to which you have provided similar services.<br />4. Copies of applicable licensing and any product catalogs(s). <br />5. The Government is looking to recycle this metal and as such generate revenue. With that in mind, please list the potential markets for this scrap steel.<br />6. For each market listed, please provide a snapshot in time for the month of December of the market value of scrap metal.<br />7. Possible type of contract your company would recommend to accomplish this contract. Are there any specific contract types that may result in a "no-bid" decision by your company? <br />8. Based upon the requirement, what length of contract would be most advantageous? <br />9. What workload estimates are necessary to adequately scope the workload associated with this contract? Is there other data the Air Force could provide that would be useful in determining level of service required? What type of data?<br />10. What discounts and payment terms are customarily offered/negotiated on similar contracts?<br />11. What is the risk areas associated with this effort? How should they be mitigated? <br />12. Type of equipment required to accomplish the job.<br />13. Provide information on the shipping port(s) you might use.<br />14. The USAF realizes Thule AB is in a remote and isolated portion of the globe and thus there will be costs associated with taking this scrap metal to the recycling markets. Therefore, as part of this sources sought interested parties shall provide an idea of this cost. This shall be represented as an estimated percentage decrease (or range) from the market index for the scrap metal. For example, proposed market index for scrap steel in December 2009 is US $110/ton and you estimate a 15% - 25% reduction in this index to cover the cost of taking this material to market. Thus, the net income USAF might expect is US $82 - US$93/ton. Note: These are budgetary estimates. Final numbers will be requested with an official bid. The scrap and miscellaneous metals will be un-segregated and unprepared, with no more than 10% by weight consisting of other materials (wood, glass, rubber, plastic, concrete, etc).<br /><br />Important facts:</p>
<p>1. The description of the scrap metal pile is as follows:</p>
<p>- Pipe diameters vary from 4 inch to 16 inch and it is all standard weight or SCH 40 <br />- Pipe lengths vary with most around 20 ft and there are welded flanges, bends, tees, and a few valves attached <br />- Steel plate thickness is about 70% (by area) 1/4 inch, 10% 1/2 inch, 10%<br />5/8 inch and 10% 3/4 inch<br />- Steel plate size vary with maximum dimensions around 10 ft<br />- Each tank was 2.5 million U.S. gallons; Number of tanks already torn down 26<br />- Tank height was 40'<br />- Tank diameter was 100'<br />- Tank wall thickness was: Bottom 1/3 - 1", mid 1/3 - 3/4", top 1/3 - 1/2"<br />- There are various 12" and 16" inlet/outlet/transfer pipeline pieces along with both 12" and 16" valves from the tanks and pipeline.</p>
<p>Original tank dimensions were 100 ft diameter and 40 ft height with a conical roof. We have about 2,100 tons of piping and 5,200 tons of scrap from the tanks, a total of 7,300 tons.</p>
<p>Other Important Facts:</p>
<p>1. The only means to remove the scrap metal from Thule AB is via ship or air. <br />2. Due to the weather conditions at Thule, outdoor work normally needs to be accomplished between May to September. During this period, May, Jun, and July, and most of August will have 24 hours of daylight. <br />3. Due to the weather the dock is generally open from Jun through mid September. <br />4. The Pier is capable of receiving large ships and is located approximately 1 mile away on improved dirt road from the scrap pile. There are no roads or rail service out of Thule AB.<br />5. The airport is also located approximately 1 mile away from the scrap pile. <br />6. Contractor will be required to provide all of the required equipment to transport the scrap metal to the pier for loading onto the ship, which will be coordinated with the onsite contractor. <br />7. Two Danish ships come to Thule AB to off-load supplies. They depart and return to the port in Aalborg Denmark. The first ship arrives at the beginning of July and the second ship arrives in Aug. There is a charge associated with transporting items on these ships. <br />8. One American ship comes to Thule AB to off-load supplies. It departs and returns to Norfolk, Virginia and normally arrives at Thule AB in mid July.<br />9. Lodging is available on Thule for approximately $35.00 per night, food for approximately $9.00 per day, and a rental car for approximately $100.00 per day. <br />10. All questions need to be provided in writing. For Danish/Greenlandic interested parties: Contact Patrick King via email at patrick.king@det1.dk and for US interested parties contact David Sonnenberg via email at david.sonnenberg@peterson.af.mil or Renata Ott via email at renata.ott@peterson.af.mil.<br />11. If required, a site visit can be arranged for any interested contractor at no cost to the Government.</p>

<DESC>Clarification #2 to Request For Information (RFI) #3
<p>I. Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1. A company responded to the NAICS code change posting with commentary on the change in NAICS code and how it might affect potential small business participation or set-aside possibilities on LISC. The response was neither formatted per either RFI#2 or RFI #3 requirements, nor addressed the questions posed by either RFI in the manner required. Because the company is a RFI#2 respondent, it therefore has the right to issue a revised response to RFI#2. The communication demonstrated lack of full awareness of the potential impacts of the NAICS code change, as well as the Government's rationale for the change. The Government decided to treat this communication as a query instead of a RFI response and issued the following clarification:</p>
<p>SMC's response: If your response to RFI #2 will change as a result of the change in the NAICS code, please resubmit your RFI#2 response by July 26, in the template you used to originally respond. Please note that this NAICS code applies only to the prime contractor (or the prime team's components) on the contract. NAICS codes for subcontracts are chosen by the prime contractor but must be defended as appropriate in light of the work to be performed on the subcontract. <br />Regarding RFI#3, any small-business set-aside(s) based on requirements currently encompassed by the LISC PWS might warrant a different NAICS code, depending on the work to be performed on the set-aside(s). If you identify any such set-aside(s) as possible, please make sure you defend the use of the NAICS code you believe applies to that set-aside.<br />Regarding our final choice of NAICS code, we have always maintained that everything we have briefed on LISC is pre-decisional and subject to change. We have yet to go to ASP. SMC/BC has also been in agreement with the LISC program office since last November that the NAICS code previously used (541712) was not the correct one for LISC because it applies primarily to R&amp;D work, which will be minimal on LISC. The LISC program office and SMC/BC then resolved to revise the NAICS code as soon as practicably possible. Our decision was not made based on business size but on which NAICS code best captured the most requirements on LISC. This exchange with SMC/BC is well documented internally. The LISC program office did not make this decision either from within a vacuum or without considering the impacts to small business. We remain committed to maximizing the amount of work for small business as a part of LISC, while ensuring mission success and not threatening the efficiencies the Government expects to gain from LISC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A company requested clarification regarding suspenses.</p>
<p>SMC's Response: <br />1) Revisions to RFI#2 are due NLT COB July 26. Only companies that previously responded to RFI#2 may submit revisions to RFI#2. <br />2) Responses to RFI#3 are due NLT COB July 28.</p>
<p>3. A company asked whether 9pt font could be used in tables and graphics.</p>
<p>SMC's response: Yes, this is acceptable.</p>
<p>II. Questions: All communication associated with this RFI shall be submitted via email to Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil.<br /><br />III. Point of Contact: <br />Primary: Mr. George Sullivan, contract specialist, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil <br />or (310) 653-1772 <br />Alternate: Ms. Van Choat, Government Contracting Officer, at van.choat@losangeles.af.mil or (310) 653-2488</p>
<p>IV. DECLARATION: All other aspects of RFI #3 (e.g. response due date, white paper content and form requirements, submission format, etc.) posted on FBO on 1 July 2010 remain unchanged. This posting is issued for clarification purposes only.</p>

<SUBJECT>Synopsis Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Follow-On (F/O) System
<SOLNBR>FA8819-10-R-0002
<CONTACT>Jack May, Phone (310) 416-1703, Email jack.may@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This amendment revises paragraph two of the Fedbizops posting of 22 Apr 2010:<br /><br />Paragraph two, two sentences are added to the end of the fifth sentence to state:&nbsp; The proposed contract will include the delivery of a single space surveillance vehicle with a priced option for the delivery of a second space vehicle.&nbsp; Second space vehicle is contingent on the Government's space-based surveillance needs in the FY15 timeframe.<br /><br />Paragraph two, sixth sentence is amended to read:&nbsp; This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for a period of five years after launch of optional second space vehicle.<br /><br /><br />The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), SBSS F/O Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire a second SBSS satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. SBSS F/O is an Acquisition Category ID program. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel.
<p>The objective of SBSS F/O is to deliver space surveillance capabilities to address the SSA needs of the warfighter. The SBSS F/O mission is to collect metric position and Space Object Identification data on manmade Resident Space Objects. SBSS F/O will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to serve users who require SSA of deep-space and near-earth resident objects. SBSS F/O will be part of a "Family of Systems", interoperable with existing systems, and enhancing the global reach of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence for Air Force Space Control. The F/O capability will be fielded to mitigate the end of life of the SBSS Block 10 satellite, and the acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in 2nd qtr FY11 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years. Proposal instructions and timelines will be communicated via the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>In order to receive the bidder's library password, a copy of any secret collateral documents, and participate in future Industry Days, potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 30 April 2010 to Jim Austin at jim.austin@losangeles.af.mil who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret Technical Requirements Document (TRD) to an authorized facility. Response to this notice from small and small disadvantaged businesses qualified to prime this opportunity is encouraged.</p>
<p>Potentially interested prime contractors will be invited to attend our planned Industry Day(s). Our first Industry Day is tentatively planned for 18 May 10. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to six attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, a SF86 that is signed/dated within the last year, a JPAS printout and evidence of a local records check in the last year. If a person is currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, the SF86 is current within the last year and the local records check was accomplished within the last year, then only a PAR with JPAS printout is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Industry Day". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one or two page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments along with any subsequent document releases will be attached and posted under this GPE, https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The SMC Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. <br />Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), SYSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>

The principal components of the work remain the same and the requirement remains set-aside as an 8(a) competitive negotiated procurement.

The USDA Forest Service, Angeles National Forest (hereafter "the Government", "Forest Service", or "Angeles national Forest (NF)") announces a requirement for the Architectural and Engineering Services, followed by construction of a 3 (three) Bay Fire Station and 10 man Barracks with a possible option of one (1) more Barracks and site improvements, on land owned by the US Forest Service in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Fire Center will act as a station and staging area allowing for the increase and decrease of fire resources based on funding and need; and it will serve as home base for fire resources that can be strategically moved in the San Gabriel Canyon to provide coverage for high risk areas. The new Rincon Fire Station is designated to house three fire engines (Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East Fork). The current Rincon engine will remain at the Rincon Fire Station. The Crystal Lake and East Fork engines will be moved to the Rincon site. The water tender, fire prevention technician, and recreation personnel will continue to be co-located at the site. New facilities will be constructed at the Rincon site to house the three engines with personnel, the water tender with personnel, and the fire prevention technician with the Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East Fork engines. The A&amp;E will apply the values of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, sustainability and reliability creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to the Agency's values. The facility will meet Federal Energy Goals, security requirements and current codes governing the design. The proposed action will consist of the following: The existing Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East fork facilities will be demolished and replaced with a newly constructed approximately 5026 square foot energy efficient office/garage building, and one 10-person barracks at Rincon (with a possible option of second 10 person Barracks). The office/garage will include two tandem garage bays, offices, meeting room, weight room, training room, storage rooms and restroom facilities. The work will also include the installation of a new septic system and connection into existing power and water systems. The buildings and site will comply with the Forest Service architectural guidelines, and the relocation of an existing pre-fabricated metal warehouse to a new location at the west area of the site and all site improvements. The work includes the furnishing of labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, lodging, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work required under the terms and conditions of the resulting contract.

<CONTACT>Jordan Dorsey 757-443-1411 Carissa Holland757-443-1338
<DESC>The Contracting Department, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, VA, 23511-3392 intends to negotiate a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with Firm Fixed Price pricing provisions and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Items" and FAR Part 15 "Contracting by Negotiation".
The contractor shall provide IT services for the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET), and to accomplish migration of business support and command and control (C2) systems from legacy networks to ONE-NET.  ONE-NET provides 24/7/365 NIPRNet/SIPRNet access, network connectivity and security, electronic mail and Blackberry, file and print services, voice over SIPRNet (VOSIP), web access, and desktop support via Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs) and the Local Network Support Centers (LNSCs) located at Fleet concentration areas throughout OCONUS.  
This 24/7/365 capability includes the functional areas of Network and Systems Operations (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Management, Network Defense (ND), Common Applications Support, and Transport Services).  Additional support extends into Service Desk, Field Services, Information Assurance, Network Technical Support, IT Service Management, Enterprise Management Support, Voice Over Internet & Telephone Support, and Theater Application Support. Through Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), ONE-NET infrastructure is installed at fourteen (14) overseas fleet concentration areas, owned and operated by NAVY CYBERFOR. 
The ONE-NET infrastructure is comprised of three (3) TNOSCs located at Yokosuka (Japan), Naples (Italy), and Manama (Bahrain). TNOSCs function as the single point of contact for the network operations and the focal point for decisions for regional customers. These decisions involve service priorities, restoration priorities, and other enterprise-wide operational issues within their region. Service is primarily focused on Network and Systems Operations, Service Desk, Network Technical Support and Information Assurance.  The Yokosuka TNOSC services the Far East Theater and the Naples and Bahrain TNOSCs service the Europe and Middle East theaters respectively.  These three theaters are under the operational control of Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific (PAC) and NCTAMS Atlantic (LANT).
LNSCs are extensions of a TNOSC where physical presence is required.  Service at this level shall be primarily hardware-related and limited to device and cable plant maintenance, component replacement, and providing the on-site touch labor to respond to service requests and system problems that cannot be resolved by the TNOSC remotely.  LNSC supports life-cycle maintenance activities and ONE-NET service level objectives by providing touch-labor associated with the refresh and warranty repair of devices attached to the ONE-NET network.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, and the Size Standard is $25.0M.  This prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) will be processed utilizing "Full and Open Competition", and will not contain a required Small Business Subcontracting Plan as FAR Part 19 does not apply OCONUS.
The resulting contract will be for the period of a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) twelve month option years along with FAR Clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services".  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  A complete RFP package will be available by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 20 September 2010.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract for streambank stabilization and restoration in White Plains, NY. This project consists of a combination of structural and non-structural (bioengineering) elements next to the Bronx River Parkway, in the vicinity of the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York. Structural elements, in the form of a boulder rock toe, are to be used at the base of the streambank along approximately 535 linear feet, in those locations where the combination of flow velocity and angle of impact exceed the level of protection non-structural solutions alone can provide. A vegetated stone revetment, combining hard structures and live stakes is to be placed along approximately 73 linear feet directly abutting the existing stone masonry wall to prevent its failure. The remaining length of project, approximately 1000 feet is to be protected through the use of re-grading, to create a more gradual and stable streambank slope, and replanting with native species to stabilize the slope. Erosion control fabric shall be combined with plantings. This project will consist of a base bid with options.<br /><br />The estimated range of this work is between $300,000 and $800,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 30 July 2010 with bid opening on/about 31 August 2010.

<DESC>CMS issued a T&amp;M Contract (HHSM-500-2010-00024C) on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 19.8 "Contracting With The Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program). The T&amp;M effort shall assist the CMS and the responsible FMSG project office; implement the HITECH incentive payment program created under Title XXX of Division A, and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and reinvestment Act of 2009. The legislation establishes a required incentive-payment system start date of October 1, 2010 for hospitals and chronic care facilities, and January 1, 2011 for other medical services providers.
<p>The T&amp;M was awarded because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent of the work needed with any degree of confidence. The requirements of the SOW are unique, non-repetitive, and the work is non-severable.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the agency's need is for a brand name commercial item for authorized resale (FAR 6.302-5). A J&A is not required, per FAR 6.302-5.<br><br>BACKGROUND: Warm Springs Dam, Lake Sonoma is located on Dry Creek, in Sonoma County, California 14 miles above the confluence with the Russian River and the City of Heasldsburg. The San Francisco District (District) owns and operates two reservoirs on tributaries to the Russian River, Warm Springs Dam, Lake Sonoma in Sonoma County and Coyote Valley Dam, Lake Mendocino, on the EF Russian River in Mendocino County. Both dam are multi-purpose projects, consisting of flood control, water conservation and recreation facilities operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District to reduce flood damages.<BR>Warm Spring Dam was completed in the early 1980s and consists of a rolled earth embankment, with a dam crest of 319 ft above the streambed. At gross pool, Lake Sonoma captures 381,000 acre-feet of runoff from the upper Dry Creek watershed, 130 square miles, above the Dam. Outlet flows are regulated via the projects two service gates and multi-level low flow outlet and an unregulated ogee spillway for emergency releases. The design flood peak inflow and outflow are 77,000 and 37,700 cubic feet per second, respectively, with 6 feet of freeboard.<BR>This study shall examine the adequacy of the Warm Spring Dam Spillway and its effects downstream of the dam, along Dry Creek and the Russian River. <BR><BR>3) OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTOR: The Contractor shall gather information, collect data, and perform analyses as necessary to successfully complete the tasks given in section 5 of this scope of work. All technical work performed as part of this scope of work shall be conducted by personnel trained in hydrology and hydraulics with a minimum of 3 years of experience. The work shall be supervised by a person trained in hydrology and hydraulics with a minimum of 10 years of experience who is also registered in the state of California as a civil engineer.<BR><BR><BR>4) OBLIGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT: Government personnel will be available for advice, guidance, and comments on all work under this contract. Any comment, advice and/or guidance given by the Government personnel will be to assist the Contractor in performing the work and will not change the scope of work or release the Contractor from performing all work required herein unless written notification of such, signed by the Contracting Officer (CO) is received by the Contractor. Should the Contractor require assistance from the Government in regards to this scope, they shall contact one of the Government's points of contacts given in section 1 of this scope of work. The Government's point of contact will then either assist the Contractor directly, or provide an appropriate point of contact to answer the Contractor's questions.<BR><BR>5) DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the adequacy of the Warm Spring Dam Spillway and to determine the most likely downstream inundation area and flood depths in case of failure of the dam. The analysis shall determine the downstream inundation caused by both with and without failure analysis of the dam for the Probably Maximum Flood (PMF), as well as the 50-, 100-, 200-, and 500-year frequency based storms and a sunny day failure scenario. The study also includes mapping of the various failure analyses. <BR><BR>The flood wave shall be routed from Warm Springs Dam, along Dry Creek to the Russian River to the Pacific Ocean. The District just completed a similar study for Coyote Valley Dam in July 2009. Coyote Valley Dam is also located in the Russian River watershed, upstream of Warm Springs Dam and Dry Creek. The Coyote Valley Dam study routed the flood wave from Coyote Valley Dam thru the Russian River to the Pacific Ocean. The hydraulic model used for the Russian River portion of the study has already been developed as part of the Coyote Valley Dam study and shall be used for this study for the Russian River reach between Dry Creek and the Pacific Ocean. <BR><BR>The same methodology for the Coyote Valley Dam study shall be used in this study. This report shall be made available to the contractor for review prior to the Fee Proposal due date. The study will include the use of existing GIS data, terrain model, flow data, high water marks, hydraulic and hydrologic models developed for the entirety of the Russian River watershed for the Coyote Valley Dam study.<BR><BR>Additional data shall be provided to the contractor specific to Warm Springs Dam and Dry Creek. Additional cross section data is available for Dry Creek from the District office and shall be provided to the contractor. However, it will be necessary to develop additional channel data along Dry Creek based on FEMA profiles, site visit and older HEC-2/HEC-RAS geometries. The hydraulic models will be calibrated and validated to available historic data. Calibrated models will be used to model all of the events. Data specific to calibration of the models, such as high water marks, is limited and additional research will be necessary to determine the availability and quality of such data. <BR><BR>

The main advantage of the Rouge Research system over other existing systems includes the company's ability to provide researchers with a complete functional ("turn-key") system, including a Polaris camera, Apple computer, Magstim TMS coil, Brainsight neuronavigation software, patient chair and equipment stand. Rouge Research has been the established vendor for the same equipment at other VA Medical Centers, including Seattle, Baltimore, and Gainesville. Rouge Research is the only company that sells the equipment listed above as a package.
7.	DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONDUCT ANY MARKET RESEARCH TO LOCATE SOURCES: Contacted vendor who then submitted documentation. Extensive market research conducted by Research group found no other comparable company that offered the complete set of equipment and tools necessary for performing TMS according to our specifications. US-based vendors were specifically sought, but none provided a complete functional system.
8.	CUSTOMER'S SUBMISSION OF PRICE ANALYSIS. Quote provided by Rouge Research, Inc.
9.	ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SUPPORT OF SUBMISSION: N/A
10.	LISTING OF ANY SOURCES (IF ANY) THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT: None.
 
11.	FUTURE ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIER TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: This is a one-time purchase and should not create barriers for future competition.
12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my belief and knowledge and the cost is fair and reasonable.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VA Puget Sound Health Care System.

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of miscellaneous roof repairs on several Seattle Division buildings from O'Neill Contracting, Inc. (a 100% SDVOSB roofing contractor).  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Replacement of the B100 4th floor roof. Repair (not replacement) of various defects (install roof patches, repair parapet flashing, repair utility penetrations, repair roof drains) on Seattle Division B1 and B100 buildings.   This proposed work will address current roofing leaks with replacement of one roof and repair work on several other roofs that will extend overall roof life expectancy.  The VA PSHCS strongly desires a roofing contractor to perform this work rather than a general contractor.  Construction cost estimate is $350,000 for all portions of the work (replacement and building roof repairs).  The VA PSHCS system wants award by June 25, 2010 and work completed by September 30, 2010.   

4.	Statutory Authority:  

(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	( X )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;  
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  
819.7007 Sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.
(a) A contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided:
(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;
(2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5;
(3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and
(4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.
(b) The contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer.  A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
(c) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure businesses are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Construction contracts are normally competed however on rare occasions a sole source selection is in the best interests of the government and can insure a quality product.  It is this Contracting Officer's experience that sole source is seldom used for construction projects and that Puget Sound Health Care System fully supports and promote competition.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 350,000.00.  The RFP price response will be compared to the existing market survey pricing and the RS Means construction industry pricing guide. 


8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  VA PSHCS Facility Management Service requested an independent roofing contractor to evaluate the roofing condition of these buildings and to provide a cost estimate for the repair work for budgetary purposes.  

9.	Other Considerations:  O'Neill Contracting has performed roof repair work in the past at the Seattle Division. They have been willing to work around the facility's frequent requests for temporary work stoppages.  Their past performance has been excellent. They have provided very good workmanship and, most importantly, have been willing to suggest alternate repair processes due to unforeseen site conditions. 

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None


11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  Open competition is normally used for construction projects.  Only on rare occasions has the sole source option been used.  Projects are prepared timely and allow adequate time for full and open competition. 

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<AWDNBR>VA678A00220
<ARCHDATE>07282010
<DESC>Justification for Other Than
Full and Open Competition Document

The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.
	
1.  Agency Identification 
	
Department of Veterans Affairs (678)
Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS)
3601 S. 6th Avenue
Tucson, AZ 85723

2.  Description of Action Being Approved

This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition comes as a result of a current requirement at the Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) to replace imaging systems located in the Medical Media Section.  

3.	Description
  
Emergent 2237 request received to purchase two (2) each Kyocera Taskalfa 750C imaging systems for a total estimate of $41,214 replacing current equipment that is no longer functioning properly.  Date required of the request if 6/28/10.    
     
4.	Statutory Authority/Authority Cited  

The basis of this justification is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. 

(a) Authority. 
(1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2). 
(2) When the agencys need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for. 
	
5.  Reason for Authority Cited

The reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency is delay in award of a contract could result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.  The current equipment used for print jobs in Medical Media is no longer functioning properly to meet the service demands.  The equipment is constantly breaking down requiring numerous repair visits.  The equipment breakdowns are incurring additional costs not only in repairs but emergent print jobs are needed to be sent out to local vendors at upwards of close to $2000 per print job.  Medical Media indicates they have frequent emergent print job requests along with numerous weekly routine print jobs and the current unreliable equipment is becoming a burden not only financially as noted above but daily work flow interruption results in lost production affecting both Medical Media and other areas of SAVAHCS.  The situation with the current equipment has become unmanageable and now requires immediate replacement.  

6.  Sources Sought Efforts 

	Sometime prior to the current urgent situation, Medical Media staff had input a PIN request for replacement equipment and had reviewed not only the Kyocera model but  other similar imaging system brands both open market and on GSA FSS.  The Kyocera was deemed to best meet the Medical Media needs in terms of equipment footprint (Kyocera is taller versus wider therefore a space saver); the Kyocera was found to better meet green environmental standards; more copies per toner cartridge; and superior consumer reviews were found.  The specific Kyocera equipment is neither available on their GSA contract nor available from any other GSA FSS source.  One current local authorized Kyocera dealer, Digital Imaging Systems, presently provides maintenance/repair service for the equipment in Medical Media and in other areas of the medical center and has proven to be a reliable, responsible provider.  The other considered local imaging system source offering similar equipment, Ricoh, has also been used for maintenance/repair services in the medical center and has not proven to be as reliable as Digital Imaging Systems.  Purchase of the Kyocera will not only ensure a superior product is received to meet Medical Medias current and future demands but also ensure reliable after sale maintenance and repair service is available locally.
 
7.  Determination of Fair/Reasonable Price 	

The equipment is being offered directly from Kyocera under their current promotional Government Open Market Price List.  The Kyocera Alfatask 750C with needed accessories is offered at $21,216 per each, FOB:  Destination.  This pricing reflects an approximate 10% discount off of Kyoceras current published price list for same.  Authorized Kyocera dealers are prohibited from offering pricing that deviates from current Kyocera established pricing so competing amongst authorized dealers would not realize better pricing.  Additionally, the pricing is comparable to other similar recently considered imaging systems both open market and GSA FSS.  With this information the offered pricing is deemed to be fair and reasonable.  Kyocera is considered a responsible vendor with a D&B SQR score of 5 which is medium risk and no matches were found in the various debarred databases.  It is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government to proceed with immediate purchase of the subject equipment to avoid further unnecessary financial expenditures, workflow disruption, and production loss being experienced with the existing equipment.
