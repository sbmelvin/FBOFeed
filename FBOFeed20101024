Contracting Office Address
Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East Program Office, CBO Contracting, 3773 Cherry Creek North Drive Ste 450, Denver, CO 80209, UNITED STATES
Description
The VA Specialty Care Services Program Office seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible vendor that can meet the Governments requirement for Telehealth Services (NAICS 621999) to support the Department of Veterans Affairs nationwide.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.         

Specialty Care is a critical component of the comprehensive medical benefits package of healthcare services provided directly by the VHA and/or arranged for outside of VHA to meet the needs of our Veterans. Veterans often experience fragmented care and services, long wait times, and unacceptable delays exacerbated by limited numbers of providers in a number of specialties and in certain geographic areas, particularly rural areas.  In order to transform the delivery of Specialty Care Services within VHA, it is our goal to provide these services in rural and medically underserved areas and Community Based Outpatient Clinics.  In order for this transformation to occur, Primary Care Providers will need CMEs/CEUs in order to work at the top of their license.  In order for this goal to be met, a provider/vendor will need to meet all of the following requirements to support the Department of Veterans Affairs nationwide:

1.	Ability to provide telehealth consultation with the use of state-of-the-art clinical videoconferencing and phone equipment.
2.	Expertise in providing training for support of VA teams (Specialist physicians; Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant/Registered Nurse; Clinical Pharmacist; Psychiatrist; Psychologist; Project Coordinator; Telehealth Specialist; Clinical Education Specialist) to deliver education to the Primary Care Providers to treat chronic/complex healthcare cases.
3.	Provide Implementation Plan, decision-making tools, templates, and disease specific checklists for use.
4.	Ability to provide consultation services during implementation and maintenance of the project model.
5.	Expertise in developing a program that supports the concepts of the Patient Centered Medical Home.
6.	Demonstrated or proven (published articles in peer reviewed journals) outcomes in replicating the same service to at least five (5) other healthcare organizations with demonstrated success.
7.	Assistance with program evaluation that demonstrates efficiencies gained from project implementation.
8.	Ability to provide this service by March 2011.


Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 2:00 pm on Thursday, 28 October 2010.     Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:     (1) capability and experience in providing and delivery of Telehealth support services; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).     The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disabled veteran owned businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.     As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.     If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the November 2010 time frame.     All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.     All information received will be considered.     Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may result in a sole source acquistion.   

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.     The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

Any company that feels they have the capabilities that meet the needs of the Government please provide a detailed technical capabilities statement to Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East Program Office, CBO Contracting, ATTN: Ronnie Sandusky (Contracting Officer), 3773 Cherry Creek North Drive Ste 450, Denver, CO 80209,  ronnie.sandusky2@va.gov or fax (303) 398-7176.  Emails should include Elena.jenkins@va.gov and Kevin.crook@va.gov.  All technical capabilities statements must include how the company intends to meet this requirement.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this "sources sought" synopsis.
