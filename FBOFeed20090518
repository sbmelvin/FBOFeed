<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) - The 672 ARSS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Phase II effort on or about January 4, 2010. The objective of the CRIIS program is to provide enhanced TSPI accuracy and selected participant data bus information for test and training event participants, incorporating an advanced spectrally efficient data link. CRIIS is to be developed consistent with the overall goal of maximizing commonality among range instrumentation systems for test and evaluation and training applications. The Government anticipates the award on or about 1 August 2010 of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee with Performance Incentives contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Fixed-Price-Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF) production lot options, and Time and Material (T&amp;M) options for Interim Contractor Support (ICS). If further risk reduction is deemed necessary, a technology maturation effort may be required prior to entering EMD for Increment 3.&nbsp; Proposals are due 30 days after RFP release. This competition is restricted to the two prime contractors who have participated in the 22-month Risk Reduction and Technology Maturation Phase (Phase I) of CRIIS. Schedule details for the various Increments can be viewed on the CRIIS schedule chart attached to this NOCA.<br />The Government intends to process a class Justification and Approval for this and subsequent related contracting actions to be awarded to the successful offeror. The Government also intends to award one or more additional contracts or modifications for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the fielded CRIIS system.<br />This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Responding firms must submit to the below contracting officer a statement of capability, to include the results of demonstration tests showing component maturity levels at TRL 6 or higher for all relevant technologies. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This pre-solicitation notice neither constitutes a RFP nor an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. All interested parties must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide this capability within 45 days of this publication date to be considered by the Government. Interested sources should contact the Points of Contact identified in this announcement. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />The Air Armament Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer previously identified. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman, Col Arnold W. Bunch, Jr., AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495, (850) 882-5422.</p>

<SUBJECT>D -- JSTARS RFI: WIDEBAND LINE OF SIGHT AND BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT COMMUNICATIONS
<SOLNBR>R2070
<CONTACT>Scott Maitland Scott.Maitland@Hanscom.Af.mIL

<a href="mailto:Scott.Maitland@Hanscom.Af.mIL">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>SynopsisThe 751st Electronic Systems Group (ELSG) is seeking information relative to mature technical solutions to achieve a wideband line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) digital communications capability for the E-8C Joint STARS aircraft and its communications partners.  This Request for Information (RFI) will be followed by an Industry Day currently scheduled for 7-9 July 2009. This Request for Information (RFI) is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force Electronic System Center at Hanscom AFB to determine potential sources capable of designing and developing wideband (WB) Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond LOS (BLOS) IP-based data links and associated networking capabilities for the E-8C Joint STARS and other widebody airborne platforms as well as related ground-based facilities.
Joint STARS is a system of systems consisting of both airborne and ground-based segments.  It features the USAF E-8C, a militarized Boeing 707-300 aircraft with airborne radar, operations and control, and communication subsystems designed to support and be interoperable with existing and planned joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems. The ground-based segment consists of the US Army Common Ground Station (CGS) and the Joint Services Workstation (JSWS).  Army is currently modernizing the CGS to Army Distributed CGS (DCGS-A). These systems receive E-8C complete radar data in near real-time (NRT) and process, store, and display that data, allowing the operators to build and maintain Situational Awareness (SA) of the operational environment through detailed analysis. 
Joint STARS expanded data communications will need to support operations by providing IP connectivity to relevant airborne and ground agencies, by being robust to jamming for a significant percentage of the communications transacted, by providing the necessary quality of service over the links and nets which Joint STARS enables and by providing sufficient throughput to satisfy the various information exchange requirements associated with the missions.  Due to the huge amounts of data the E-8C receives and transmits, the Government is now looking at industry to provide a solution capable of low latency, wideband, Anti-Jam (AJ), and robust communications for both BLOS and LOS communications with various aircraft and with ground-fixed and ground-transportable facilities/networks.
The 751st ELSG and its customers are looking for communications systems as part of an industry recommended solution set, with an explanation of their utility and their applicability to the missions served by Joint STARS and its communication partners, and the feasibility for these systems to be integrated on the.  A description of the current communication areas can be found as an attachment to this Synopsis. 
This RFI is for information, planning, and market research analysis only; therefore, it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure a WB LOS/BLOS communications and networking capability at this time.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation nor is it a request for proposals (RFP).  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. The Government is not responsible for any cost respondents may incur to prepare responses to this RFI.  Response to this RFI from industry is strictly voluntary.  Should the 751st solicit for proposals to build the WB LOS/BLOS communications system, such an announcement would not occur prior to calendar year 2010.  Installation and initial fielding of the capability would then be nominally projected for calendar year 2013.

<CONTACT>Robert E Rollins, Phone 478-222-1900, Email robert.rollins@robins.af.mil
<DESC><p>The proposed action is for repair of the Programmable Logical Control (PLC) system on the T-10 Hush House located at the Idaho Air National Guard Base in Boise, ID. Performance will be on the base. The T-10 Hush House is a standalone building used to test engines. This system on the Hush House has been down and needs urgent repair, so a 14 day turnaround time after receipt of award is required. The specific PLC system requires data which Vital Link has proprietary data rights.
<p>Therefore, the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Vital Link, Inc (CAGE Code: 0ZV99) under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.</p>

<DESC>In a continuing effort to meet the public’s demands and expectations for recreation opportunities and to maximize the value of available funds, a need has been identified for professional business consulting services to assist with the development and implementation of a more business-based approach to Forest Service recreation management.  
The Forest Service anticipates requesting business consulting services on an as needed basis for a variety of tasks.  These tasks may vary from being national in scope to affecting only one Region or National Forest.  For example, at the national level the agency may be interested in exploring options for enhancing partnership capabilities and expanding contributed income funding opportunities.  Services may be requested to help identify strategies and the Agency may seek assistance in pursing implementation support for the strategies. 
At a smaller scale, services may be sought on an as needed basis to assist with reviewing or improving various business processes.  An example might be to review financial analysis used to support capital investment decisions in a Region and provide advice on ways to improve the process.  In some cases, advice and assistance might be sought to assist a particular Forest in evaluating potential leasing or concessionaire opportunities.

The US Forest Service is seeking an organization to provide various strategic professional business advisory and assistance services for recreation management on National Forest System lands at locations throughout the United States and its territories.  Although the term “recreation” is used throughout this document and will be the primary area of focus for business services, that is not intended to exclude obtaining similar services for those program areas closely integrated with recreation management, such as wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, heritage, interpretation, conservation education, partnerships, and volunteer management.  The business advisory and assistance services may include elements such as:  strategic planning and program management; financial analysis; market analysis; operations efficiency evaluations; partnership analysis; facility management planning; marketing; interpretation strategy; and, organizational change management.  

Proposals are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, October 20, 2008.  The solicitation will be available on approximately September 5, 2008, and can be downloaded from this site at that time.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The proposed project listed here is a partial small business set-aside.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled Identification of Outer Continental Shelf Renewable Energy Space-Use Conflicts and Analysis of Potential Mitigation Measures.  The MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein but may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, and the work is multi-disciplinary.   The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 24 months.
BACKGROUND:  The 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and its subsequent amendments require the Secretary of the Interior to balance the nations energy needs with the protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments, while ensuring that the concerns of coastal states and competing users are taken into account. Under authority granted by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the MMS may issue leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for potential renewable energy projects including, but not limited to, wind energy, wave energy, ocean current energy, solar energy, and hydrogen production. The MMS recognizes that as nearshore waters become ever-more crowded with competing users, competition for ocean space in the offshore arena will increase. Siting issues are extremely important in determining areas of possible renewable energy development. MMS decisions on lease sales must consider potential space-use conflicts on the OCS and consider how these conflicts differ during construction, operations, and decommissioning. 
SCOPE OF WORK:  The MMS needs to identify potential space-use conflicts between OCS renewable energy development and other ocean activities (e.g., fishing, shipping, recreational boating, sand and gravel extraction, military use, special areas, etc.), and identify mechanisms to mitigate or avoid potential conflicts. A geospatial database and mapping system will be developed to highlight areas on the Pacific and Atlantic OCS where potential conflict with renewable energy development is most likely to occur. A large component of the study will include ethnographic field research in coastal communities. Social scientists will visit key fishing and shipping ports along the coast and conduct meetings and discussions with informed citizens, including local commercial and recreational fishermen and shipping operators. Stakeholder meetings and other informed discussions will help to identify potential areas and causes of space-use conflict and look for ways to mitigate any such conflict. Information from the study will be used in MMS decision making on siting and monitoring renewable energy development. The study will require expertise in a host of subjects such as fisheries, GIS technical skills, ethnography, meeting planning and coordination, meeting facilitation, applied anthropology/sociology, and perhaps most importantly the ability to perform fieldwork on multiple coastlines. With such complexity and the diversity in skill needed to perform the stated objectives, the Contractor should consider partnering capabilities where appropriate. The MMS encourages the Contractor to consider partnering with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers with relevant expertise.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If your organization is interested in participating with this acquisition, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and DUNS Number via email to lisa.algarin@mms.gov or via U.S. Mail to Lisa Algarin, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, MS-2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia  20170, by 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, June 3, 2009.  Those organizations expressing an interest in this opportunity will receive a copy of the complete solicitation upon issuance.  Reference Solicitation No. M09PS00065 on all correspondence.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

"	Proposed Issue Date:  June 1, 2009
"	Title of Project:  Hazardous Materials Abatement, Requa Area Deconstruction and Site Restoration, Redwood National and State Parks
"	Description:  The work of this contract is to properly remove, package, transport, and dispose of those building finishes and components that are generally deemed hazardous to prepare the buildings for demolition. The work of this contract occurs throughout the 38-building REQUA complex.  The work can be described as follows:
1.	Plan, design and install necessary temporary services and protection including temporary power, lighting, and temporary water distribution system.  Safe-off all utilities in each building for worker safety.  Note that some buildings do not have electrical service.  Accordingly, the contractor shall plan to use temporary power using generators.
2.	Perform soft demolition to the extent that demolition is necessary to expose asbestos pipe insulation and other hazardous materials for remediation and abatement.  Soft demolition and removal of various floor covering assemblies will be required to remove all layers of asbestos, floor tile and mastics below carpet, pad, plywood, particle board, and other substrates.  The removal of exterior transite panels and sheetrock will require substantial soft demolition of added on wall and ceiling assemblies.  The generated nonhazardous construction and demolition debris may remain in or next to the building.  
3.	Remove all friable and nonfriable asbestos containing building materials with an asbestos content greater than 1/10th of 1%.  Note: Sheetrock assemblies with less than 1% in the joint compound must be removed.  ACMs include asphaltic roof membranes, steam pipe insulation, tank, floor tile and mastic, floor leveling compounds, sheet flooring and mastic, acoustical ceiling tile and mastic, plaster ceilings, transite panels and flues, and exterior paint coatings.  It is the Government's intent to remove all asbestos containing construction materials so the site is clean for demolition and site restoration.
4.	Remove or otherwise prepare surfaces painted with lead containing or lead based paints.  The purpose of this selected coating removal or preparation work is to create a clean and solidify substrate to prevent exposure to lead dust to the construction workers during the planned demolition, and to remove loose and peeling paint coatings before demolition to segregate waste streams.
5.	Salvage engine and hydraulic oils and lubricants.  Salvage any remaining CFC refrigerants, recycle lead acid batteries, and remove all PCB light ballasts.
"	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
"	 Estimated price range, $2,500,000 - $3,400,000.
"	Time for completion, 215 calendar days. 
"	Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
"	All responsible 8(a) sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
"	It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
"	Small Disadvantaged Business and  HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns  and  52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit, on a Sole Source basis, iRobot Corporation, 8 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730-1402, to provide systems engineering and design to integrate an existing iRobot data bubble and dispenser into an ongoing Office of Naval Research (ONR) project. The bubble and dispenser system has been selected by ONR for integration into the system being developed which requires engineering modifications, test, and manufacture.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The iRobot design of the bubbles and dispensers has been selected by ONR for use on this project.  iRobot is the only company that owns the data and design of the equipment.  Use of another company to redesign the system would introduce new and unacceptable delays as well as large cost increases.  Additionally, selecting a new contractor could easily introduce unacceptable errors into the system and render it unacceptable for op! erational use.  This is an FNC which is a limited project that will not yield an operational system for future use.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS CODE IS 541330; Small Business Size Standard is $27M; FSC is R425

<DESC>The Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program is the centerpiece of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.  This program provides Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities more choices for receiving employment services.  Under this program the Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing Tickets to eligible beneficiaries who, in turn, may assign those Tickets to an Employment Network (EN) of their choice to obtain employment services, vocational rehabilitation services or other support services necessary to maximize their economic self-sufficiency through work opportunities.  An EN shall be either an agency or instrumentality of a State (or political subdivision of the State) or a private entity that assumes responsibility for the coordination and delivery of employment, vocational rehabilitation or other support services to those beneficiaries who have assigned their Tickets to the EN. 

SSA will award contracts to qualifying offerors to perform services as Employment Networks for the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program.  Each contract will consist of a five-year period of performance, with an option for an additional five-years.

Request for Proposal (RFP) number SSA-RFP-09-0010G will be available for download from this website (www.fedbizopps.gov) on May 18, 2009.  This RFP will replace all previous versions.  For more information on the Ticket to Work Program, please visit the website www.yourtickettowork.com.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to purchase software particular to one manufacturer as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6 “To an item peculiar to one manufacturer.” As it stands, Infogix, Inc., 1230 E. Diehl Road, Suite 302, NAperville, IL  60563, is the only known manufacturer of the abovelisted software. 

This software is necessary to support the ITOA project provides for the protection of the critical assets of SSA’s National Computer Center (NCC) located in Woodlawn, MD.  ITOA will lessen the impact of a disaster recovery event by establishing a second, fully functional, co-processing data center (Durham Support Center (DSC), NC). At the completion of the project in FY 2012, each center will process a portion of SSA's critical and non-critical workloads. Each center will back up the data assets of the other.  To accomplish this back up, the software at the Durham site must mirror the software running at the NCC site.   Therefore, a site license for the ACR Summary/MVS software is required.  

ACR Summary/MVS is used as an informational integrity software tool.  It is used to balance output counts when information is transferred between jobs.

Infogix, Inc. is the only vendor that can supply the software license and maintenance generally required for its products because Infogix, Inc. owns intellectual property rights in its software, including copyrights. 

Any vendor capable of providing software that can perform the essential requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capabilities by September 25, 2008. The evidence must include a discussion of how the software would satisfy the proposed requirements.The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation result to the sender. All responses must be sent to Mike.DeAngelis@ssa.gov. by Thursday, May 21, 2009 12:00pm EST.

Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program.  Phase I awards do not exceed $150,000 in cost nor extend beyond a six-month period of performance.  Proposals should concentrate on that research or research and development (R/R&D) which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DHS/DNDO support in Phase II.  Several different proposed solutions to a given topic may be funded.  The measure of Phase I success includes evaluations of the extent to which Phase II results would have the potential to yield a product or process of continuing importance to DHS/DNDO and/or the private sector.  Offerors are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development they are proposing to DHS/DNDO also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The KJ1000 is designed to utilize and intensify all but 150 PSI of nitrogen from a supply bottle. The KJ1000 accepts the nitrogen from a supply source and then intensifies the nitrogen source pressure by means of a hydraulic pump and electric motor. The intensified nitrogen is then forced into an accepting nitrogen vessel. The KJ1000 is engineered to shut down when 150 PSI or less is left in the supply bottle, or when the customer desired or factory set upper level pressure is obtained (max for the KJ1000 is 2500 PSI). Requires 20 AMP electrical service; Built in pressure gauge; Quick disconnections for all hoses and fittings; 15 foot nitrogen hose;  NPT male quick disconnect supplied for customer hose from nitrogen regulator; Hand-held ON/OFF pendant switch; No contamination to nitrogen; Size 20W x 23D x 15H; Weight: 170 lbs.<BR><BR>Oil Transfer System: The KJ4000LW Oil Transfer System is a new developed technology for use as a alternative to the M3 oil pump currently being used by all branches if the Armed Services. The KJ4000LW provides .59 GPM of oil flow for ease in filling oil reservoirs, as well as recoil mechanisms, buffers, and replenishers. It can provide oil pressure up to 2550 PSI. The KJ4000LW is engineered to self-purge its system and lines of air prior to pumping oil. The KJ4000LW accepts oil from pressurized systems through the same line it discharges from by means of an innovative design. The design allows oil to flow through a 5 micron high pressure filter in either direction whether it is from a pressurized system or reservoir.<BR><BR>Oil Transfer System: The KJ4000CV Oil Transfer System in a newly developed technology for use as an alternative to the M3 oil pump currently being used by all branches of the Armed Services.

<DESC><p>Description(s): <br />This is a Sources Sought Notice. Reference Number F1Z5049051A001. Below is partial Performance Work Statement (PWS), still in its very infant drafting stages, and is subject to change. TASK: creation of a virtual reality profile and program for the "Norma Brown" trainer and annex. This capability will provide a dimension to the training that allows the students to experience "first person" and team "first person" perspectives. This technology moves the training from the "overhead" view to what responders would encounter in a real-world situation. Current technologies have advanced far enough to enable this dimension of training to be added to our current trainer and enhance our overall capabilities; however, it must address specific capabilities in order to be effective. Performance Work Statement: There are many requirements that must be met to make this evolution of training possible. Scenarios must be "open-ended," they cannot be predetermined and must include man-made and natural disasters. This will enable an evolution that is the final result of the students' decisions. Simulations (spills, fire and smoke spread, gas clouds, wind speeds, etc) must act as they would in the real world. Simulations must be able to automatically react to the actions taken by responders, the topography and weather conditions. All actions must take place in a "real time" way; however, there must be the capability for instructors to advance scenarios once learning has occurred or the student passes that portion of the evaluation or practice. Instructors must also have the ability to create new scenarios when desired. All scenarios must be created in a fashion that allows on-the-spot modifications by instructors. Scenarios must provide real time feedback to student role playing. All scenarios and simulations must have DOD specific vehicles and facilities. The system must have the capability to be updated; when the DOD develops new vehicles, equipment, uniforms etc. the simulations must be able to be updated as well. The system must have the capability to incorporate multiple agencies of law enforcement, HazMat, local, and state and federal resources that are represented in the simulations. Scenarios must be able to be viewed from all perspectives (first person, multi-team view, adjustable overhead etc.). The environment for training events must be modeled exactly after our trainers (Norma Brown AFB, and Annex). There must be the capability to have additional environments separate from our trainers (other geographic locations, desert etc.) The contractor must be able to model all our facilities and provide for, in a very realistic fashion, a fully immersive three dimensional environment that matches exactly to our trainers. This system must be able to change and develop in size. As training expands, more stations and video viewing stations must be able to be expanded. This system must be able to be linked together in a network and also be able to be "stand-alone." The system must be able, at least in part, to be transportable to be used on our mobile training teams. Instructors must have the capability to review any portion of the scenario with students for post exercise evaluation and critique with a "play-back" option. This option would allow for forward, reverse, pause etc. capability. In order for this adaptation to be effective it must meet the basic requirements listed above. Overall, the system must provide a very "user-friendly" and non-complex operating system and the company must provide training for system operators (instructors). The simulations must be visually realistic to enhance the training environment. This training system will greatly increase the realism the students experience and add a dimension they have never been able to experience. If the system is flexible and able to expand/update with time, it will allow DOD Fire Emergency Services to stay on the cutting edge and provide our trainees with the best training available anywhere. Ultimately, it will provide the best trained, most capable fire officers to the Combatant Commanders. This system must be expandable. The company who provides this simulator to the Fire Academy must have proof of an established track record, having delivered a minimum of five simulators with the same complexity and realism. They must prove they have property rights to the simulation software. They also must have in-house engineering, programming, virtual reality environment and resource modeling capability. This simulator CANNOT be a "video game" that lacks the ability to provide a completely open-ended simulation exercise. Any potential bidders must provide a demonstration of their capabilities and be able to meet all of the above criteria.
<p>The Letter of Interest and requested information may be submitted via email to carlos.collins@goodfellow.af.mil, or via fax at 325-654-4427, Attn: TSgt Collins, Carlos. At this time, please do not submit any supporting information as it will not be evaluated. Questions to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted via email only to carlos.collins@goodfellow.af.mil, no later than Monday, 2 June 2008, 1100 hours, Central Standard Time. Questions will be accepted via email only. No phone calls, please. Thank you!</p>

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>Response Deadline: 30 Days</p>
<p>Nature: This is a sources sought notice only. This is not a pre-solicitation or solicitation announcement. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of the information provided and will not pay for any costs associated with information collected. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential future solicitations. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a synopsis and/or solicitation announcement may be published at a later time. No solicitation is currently available at this time.</p>
<p>Purpose: This sources sought notice is intended to obtain market knowledge of the interest, capacity, capabilities and qualifications of vendors, particularly small business sources, who can support potential requirements.</p>
<p>Synopsis: In recent years, the US military has significantly increased cross-cultural training and education efforts. The US Air Force (USAF) has applied a culture-general approach for the general purpose force. This entails developing the transferable knowledge, skills and attitudes that most contribute to success in culturally-complex environments. Particular emphasis is being placed on Airmen's development in the attitudinal and meta-cognitive domains. The Air Force Culture and Language Center (AFCLC) requires valid and reliable means of assessing individual and group development, as well as the impact of learning on job performance, to effectively manage learning programs and gauge impact.</p>
<p>Scope: AFCLC seeks to assess the capability of vendors to adapt existing proprietary or public assessment instruments (primarily psychometric) of cross-cultural competence for use in military education and training efforts (not for selection purposes).</p>
<p>Potential Timeline: It is anticipated that any resulting contract will utilize a phased approach, with an initial 12-month period of performance and two option periods of 12-months each.</p>
<p>Potential Tasks:<br />&bull;Initial period of performance: <br />- Design: Determine the range of operational needs of Airmen as well as the institutional requirements of the USAF/AFCLC.<br />- Develop: Revise existing assessment instrument (e.g., items, scales, etc.) and associated systems (e.g., delivery, analysis, feedback, etc.) to address the context and needs.<br />- Deliver: Conduct a proof of concept application of the instrument to a small group of Airmen with analysis of data, group/individual feedback and respondent critiques.<br />&bull;Optional period of performance 1: <br />- Revision: Improve instrument and associated systems based on results of proof of concept application, respondent critiques and sponsor input.<br />- Pilot: Conduct a pilot application of the instrument to a medium sized group of Airmen with analysis of validity/reliability, group/individual feedback and respondent critiques.<br />- Recommendations: Report recommending future revisions and application in USAF/AFCLC training and education programs.<br />&bull;Optional period of performance 2:<br />- Revision: Improve instrument and systems based on results of proof of concept application, respondent critiques and sponsor input.<br />- Initial roll-out: Conduct mass application of the instrument to large groups of Airmen with analysis of validity/reliability, group/individual feedback and a random sample of respondent critiques.<br />- Finalization: Make any necessary changes identified in initial roll-out and deliver final version of instrument and associated systems.</p>
<p>Contemplated NAICS Code: <br />541 -- Professional, Scientific and Technical Services<br />541720 -- Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities<br />541990 -- All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services<br />611 -- Educational Services<br />611310 -- Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools<br />611710 -- Educational Support Services</p>
<p>Capability Briefs:</p>
<p>If your firm has, or can acquire, the appropriate rights to existing assessment instruments of cross-cultural competence, and, you believe your firm possesses the technical capability, personnel resources, and relevant experience/past performance to perform the type of work specified above, please submit the following information:</p>

<DESC><p>This is an 8(a) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) sources; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.

<p><br />THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>CMS is seeking to identify companies with demonstrated capabilities for potential award of a contract for programming support for the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. The SEER program is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which contracts with 14 cancer registries to report uniform data on all incident cancer cases in their reporting areas. The program covers about 25% of the U.S. population. Since 1991 CMS and NCI have matched SEER data to Medicare enrollment files. For cancer patients who are Medicare beneficiaries, their Medicare claims have been extracted on an individual basis to create a database for the study of cancer care among Medicare beneficiaries. The linked database provides a large population-based source of information for cancer related epidemiologic and health services research. The project requires the matching of SEER identifiers to a master file of Medicare enrollment records to determine which persons appearing in the SEER data are entitled to Medicare. For persons found to be Medicare-entitled, their Medicare claims and enrollment data are extracted and appended to their SEER record. Currently, there are more than 6 million records in the SEER program, approximately 3.3 million of which have been matched to Medicare enrollment records. In addition to SEER cases, a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries residing in SEER areas is made part of the database. Cancer-free individuals serve as a comparison group for various analyses.</p>
<p>Since 1999, CMS has contracted for programming services for the update and maintenance of the SEER-Medicare linked database, with funding support from NCI. The contractor has received identifiers from the SEER registries; linked these identifiers to Medicare enrollment records; extracted Medicare claims for matched cases; and provided other programming support to CMS and NCI for studies of cancer care in the elderly and disabled populations. The statement of work for the proposed procurement follows on previous statements of work for the provision of programming services for SEER-Medicare.</p>
<p>The next update of the SEER-Medicare linkage will begin within 4-8 weeks after the time of contract award and will include SEER cases diagnosed in 2006-2007. It is anticipated that additional updates will occur every two years. For existing linked cases, the contractor will extract additional Medicare administrative records as they become available, usually annually.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to provide programming support for the SEER-Medicare linked database. The primary tasks will involve the linkage and maintenance of the SEER-Medicare linked database. Other tasks will include extraction of Medicare claims data for Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS) sample members, and construction of analytic files and other programming support for joint CMS- NCI studies of cancer care. Currently, programming support for SEER-Medicare is provided under a CMS contract with CHD Research Associates/Fu Associates.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>CMS requests responses from 8(a) firms to demonstrate the experience and/or the ability to provide experience or knowledge of the following:</p>
<p>1. Medicare Enrollment Data<br />2. Medicare Claims Data<br />3. Hospital Cost Reports, Provider of Service Files, Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS) data, Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) directory files and Medicaid data<br />4.

Genomic and Proteomics Software and Provision of Proficiency Testing for FDA Laboratories.

Request for Information (RFI):
This is a RFI in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  It is emphasized that this is a notice for planning and information purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities or prior experience that can perform the following: 

Background:

The first two of these products, known as CompatDNA and InterORF is currently being used in the evaluation of genetic data obtained from Salmonella enterica bacteria.  The second product, known as Integrated Software System for Analysis of Bacterial Proteomics Data (ISSABPD) is being used in the evaluation of data generated from protein profiles of bacteria.  As this is an on-going collaborative research project, further modifications of these software packages will be necessary to enhance our research in the area of food protection.

A second area of immediate collaboration is in proficiency testing that can be used to evaluate FDA and Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) laboratories.  CSL currently has an extensive proficiency testing program, which is used to evaluate the capabilities of food testing laboratories within the U.K. and the European Union.  CSL has developed a system called FAPAS® (food analysis performance assessment scheme).  FAPAS is a comprehensive analytical chemistry proficiency testing scheme for evaluating the performance of laboratories in the analysis of food.  The FAPAS approach involves dispatch of certified testing materials or standards from CSL, instructions about how to store and handle the test material, statistical analysis of the results of the tests performed by the participating laboratory, assessment of the performance of the laboratory relative to other labs participating in the test, and issuance of a report of performance relative to other participating laboratories.  The FAPAS scheme includes the following analytes in food, feed and drink: Nutritional components, Food ingredients, Natural food contaminants, Organic & inorganic contaminants, Pesticides, Veterinary drug residues, Food additives, Migration from food packaging, Allergens and Authenticity.  CSL has also developed a food microbiology laboratory proficiency testing program, known as FEPAS, which is similar in structure to FAPAS.  FEPAS provides materials that can be tested for bacteria of various types that are important in food safety issues, and provides these samples in relevant food matrices.  CSL is the only laboratory in the world that has an extensive food proficiency testing program, and access to this program would be of significant importance to the FDA, significantly enhancing our ability to protect the public.



FDA Objectives: The objective is to provide a framework for developing a common approach to analytical methods in support of food safety in relation to the protection of public health and international trade.  

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services and facilities, and otherwise do all the things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work as described below.

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN personnel throughout the requirement.

The Contractor shall:

1.	Produce modifications of existing software for genomic and proteomic analysis to include, but not to be limited to, the following: 
a.	Produce modifications of genomics software (Inter-Orf) to develop a gene prediction/annotation pipeline built in a user friendly graphical interface for raw 454/pyrosequencing data.  Develop tools to compare simultaneous multiple alignments of genetic data from bacteria.  
b.	Develop software tools for DNA-barcode methods for fish species identification analysis, in conjunction with on-going CFSAN DNA-barcoding efforts.
c.	Develop software tools for interactive visualisation of large mass spectral data sets in three dimensions in order to visualize across multiple dimensions (e.g. abundance, mass, retention time) and using strain specific color coding to discern patterns.  Develop software tools to link protein information with genomic data to correlate strain specific genes identified from high throughput DNA sequencing technologies with masses of proteins from mass spectral data, and identified against public protein databases.

<DESC>(RECOVERY ACT)  The National Institute on Aging, IRP intends to negotiateand award a purchase order on a competitive basis for the purchase of a Tabletop Ultracentrifuge with a fixed angle Titanium Rotor Package, Polyallomer Tube and Adaptor     under Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.
In the lab of Research and Resource Branch (RRB); at the National Institute of Aging, this equipment purchase will assist IRP investigators in mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies.  A critical step for the successful mass spectrometric analysis lies in a sample preparation prior to mass analysis, such as the reduction of the sample complexity and/or the enrichment of the target proteins.  Tissue samples or cell pellets often need to be fractioned to obtain various organelles, which are then followed by differential centrifugation to obtain soluble and membrane protein fractions for further protease digestion and mass analysis.  Ultracentrifugation is one effective step in achieving organelle fractionation and the preparation of different proteins fractions.  Due to the often limited size of samples used for protein extraction and the fractionation conducted by scientists in the IRP, an ultracentrifuge capable of handling relatively small amount of samples is urgently needed in the RRB/PABU lab to facilitate proteomic analyses.  
Interested persons may indentify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice is a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received prior to June 1,  2009 will be considered by the Federal Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Toilet Paper and Paper Doilies by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>8540-01-378-5501 Paper, toilet, compressed, white, 4,000 feet, single-ply, unperforated <br />single sheets wound around a core, 6 rolls per box.</p>
<p>8540-00-266-9898 Paper Doily, Placemat/Tray Cover. White, 1000/BX</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS Office Support Center - Paper Products, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Toilet Paper and Paper Doilies to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>8540-01-378-5501 07202KIM, WIN201, MRC6495</p>
<p>8540-00-266-9898 None</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Toilet Paper and Paper Doilies to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 1, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS Office Support Center - Paper Products, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Label, Pressure Sensitive Adhesive to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0840 AVE-5026<br />7530-00-NIB-0841 AVE-5027<br />7530-00-NIB-0898 AVE-5164, AVE-48464<br />7530-00-NIB-0896 AVE-5165<br />7530-00-NIB-0892 AVE-5960, AVE-48960<br />7530-00-NIB-0893 AVE-5260, AVE-8160, AVE-48160<br />7530-00-NIB-0894 AVE-5261, AVE-8161<br />7530-00-NIB-0895 AVE-5263, AVE-8163, AVE-48163<br />7530-00-NIB-0899 AVE-5264, AVE-8164<br />7530-00-NIB-0897 AVE-5265, AVE-8165<br />7530-00-NIB-0900 AVE5395, AVE8395, CLI-92377, CLI-92423</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Label, Pressure Sensitive Adhesive to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 1, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSVAMC IOWA CITY, IOWA #636A8JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONJUSTIFICATIONIn accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.302-5, IL 049-07-08, and 38 U.S.C. 8127, I submit the following justifications:1.	The action being approved is entitled Installation of Pressure Reducing Valve. The project is for construction to install a new Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) to lower the steam pressure to the Air Handling Unit and the heat exchanger.  The current pressure is 50psi and the operating pressure needs to be between 12 and 15psi.  The new PRV is to be installed in Rm 121 of Building 2 at the Iowa City VAMC, in Iowa City, IA.  2.	The Medical Center needs the current PRV replaced to lower the current psi to allow AC technicians to regulate temperature.  The estimated total value of the project is less than $25,000.3.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-5 --Authorized or Required by Statute, 38 U.S.C. 8127, and IL 049-07-08 Veterans First Contracting Program. 4.	There is a local Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business registered in the VetBiz.gov database that has been identified through market research as capable of fulfilling this requirement and concurrence has been obtained from Engineering.  Based on the Office of the General Counsels interpretation as provided by Dennis Foley, AWG Services, LLC meets the requirements of FAR 6.302-5, 38 U.S.C. 8127 and IL 049-07-08 for an other than competitive sole source award. 5.	Based on the proposed procurement approach, FAR 5.202(a)(4) applies and a synopsis will not be issued.   6.	It is determined based on past activity and performance that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.7.	Market research was conducted resulting in the identification of a SDVOSB that was subsequently determined as capable completing the project.8.	There are no other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.                                                 9.	There have been no sources expressing an interest in the acquisition.10.	The agency will take no actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition for this requirement based on the guidance of FAR 6.302-5 --Authorized or Required by Statute, 38 U.S.C. 8127, and IL 049-07-08 Veterans First Contracting Program and the interpretation of the statute by the Office of General Counsel. APPROVALBased on the foregoing findings, I hereby determine, within the meaning of FAR 6.302-5 and in accordance with FAR 6.304(a)(2) and VAAR 806.304 and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 that:a.	It is in the best interest of the Iowa City, VA Medical Center to acquire the construction services for project entitled Installation of Pressure Reducing Valve, from AWG Services, LLC.Upon the basis of these justifications, I hereby authorize the sole source negotiation for this procurement and by signing this document certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my, the contracting officers knowledge and belief.______________________________________			__________________Contracting Officer					Date

<SOLNBR>EPA-2009-138
<RESPDATE>052409
<ARCHDATE>05252009
<CONTACT>Scott Tharp, Phone (513) 487-2092, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email tharp.scott@epa.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO AN ALREADY AWARDED CONTRACTOR UNDER U.S. EPA BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) OW-08-WIP.  THIS NOTICE IS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSPARENCY AS OUTLINED IN THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA).

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $4 billion to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Funds (CWSRF) to invest in the nation’s clean water infrastructure.  Of this funding, at least one half of the total must be used to provide “additional subsidization to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans or grants or any combination of these.”  

This type and level of subsidization is not provided for in the base CWSRF program, which does not allow for these funding approaches.  Historically, the CWSRF subsidy has been in the form of reduced interest rates (down to 0%) on SRF loans.  As well as the new forms of subsidy provided for in ARRA, the conference report for the legislation indicated that, while not required in the Act itself, the states are expected to “target, as much as possible, the additional subsidized monies to communities that could not otherwise afford an SRF loan.”  

Given the expanded subsidy provisions and desired targeting of the ARRA, it is important to set up the means to analyze how the money is used, and to compare the ARRA subsidy and targeting to that of past EPA CWSRF practices.  With the provisions for increased transparency included in the ARRA, EPA will have better data on how these ARRA SRF funds are spent, and should be able to judge the impact of the new approaches and focus.

The overall goal of this Task Order is to develop a system for EPA to easily analyze how ARRA funds are spent with regards to CWSRF in disadvantaged communities. This system will also enable analysis of the amounts and types of ARRA assistance provided to disadvantaged communities, and compare the ARRA fund investments to EPA's previous CWSRF assistance.

The solicitation number is VA-261-RA-0157.2.	The request is being procured exclusive of competition, for a specific vendor, on a sole-source basis.  The award will be made to Glen-Mar Construction, 15790 Se 135th Ave, Clackamas, OR 97015, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), as a firm-fixed price contract.  The projected period of performance is 30 days.3.	VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System is requesting procurement for lining of a collapsed sanitary sewer line, total length of sewer to be lined is approximately 100 linear feet at the main VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System facility in Reno, Nevada.  The estimated cost is $64,250.00.4.	The service being procured under the authority of FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and Compelling Urgency) and further utilizing Public Law 109-461 and IL 049-07-08 in support of the urgency.  PL 109-461 enables the Department of Veterans Affairs to make contract awards to SDVOSBs without competition, if the total project amount is below $5M.5.	This contract is being procured on a sole source basis due to the preservation of sanitation and health of the hospital and patients/employees/visitors.  Following is a time line of events:"	A collapsed sewer line has been an item of concern for the facility since a partial collapse occurred in the same section of sewer line several years ago.  At that time, the partial collapse did not completely block the line and the facility added a project to the existing projects list to eventually correct the condition.  However, as long as the partially collapsed line could accommodate the flow, higher priority projects were funded instead of repair of the sewer line.  "	In late January/early February 2009, the VA was told to place a call out to the various medical facilities for a list of prospective Non-Recurring Maintenance (NRM) projects that were currently unfunded to be considered for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (RA) funding.  VASNHCS Engineering Service provided a list of approximately 15 projects, including the repair of the sewer line."	In late March 2009, while the VASNCHS maintenance crew was under Bldg 1 on a separate issue, it was discovered that there was waste water draining through the concrete wall under the building and soaking the ground.  When the water was followed outside the building, it was determined that the sewer main was blocked, had filled up a large manhole and was running the path of least resistance to the concrete wall at the base of Bldg 1.  It was further determined that another collapse of the same sewer line occurred which significantly reduced the amount of flow through the line.  An emergency purchase order (654-P97767 - Encl (1)) was issued to Jet Plumbing and Drain Service to free the collapsed sewer main.  "	In the first week of April, the approved RA funded projects list was released and the Reno Sewer Line Repair was one of the approved projects."	On Thursday morning, April 16, 2009, Glen-Mar Construction, a Service Disabled Vietnam Veteran Owned Company who is currently performing construction work on a Minor Construction funded project to upgrade the Outpatient Primary Care area at the Reno facility, reported a significant sewage leak dripping from the newly installed ceiling in what will soon be the new Eligibility Enrollment Center area (part of the Primary Care project).  As demonstrated in the attached pictures, sewage backed up from the collapsed main and the pressure forced one of the caps on a sewage line inside the medical facility to blow off, spewing sewage/waste water all over the insulation above the ceiling in a room closest to the exterior building wall of Bldg 12, directly across the landing from the sewer manhole. Enclosure (2) is a picture showing the sewage dripping on the floor.  Enclosure (3) shows the sewage soaked insulation above the ceiling under the sewer pipe which lost the cap that was previously on the end of the pipe prior to the pressure sending it across the above ceiling area.  Enclosure (4) shows waste water dripping from the front corner of the access hole.  Enclosure (5) is a closer view of the water dripping from the front corner of the access hole.  Enclosure (6) shows the permanent cap placed as a repair to the indoor sewage pipe.  Enclosure (7) shows the jagged hole used for the emergency repair in the ceiling along with the constructed access hole (front) and constructed lighting fixture hole (back).  The jagged hole is directly below the sewer pipe where the ceiling had bubbled out with the water draining from the insulation above it.  Enclosures (8) and (9) are pictures of the space taken on a site walk in January 2009 of the area prior to the Contractor starting construction.  The room was previously a storage area and was unfinished with no ceiling and all utility piping fully exposed.  The Contractor framed in the walls and ceilings and was preparing to install the lighting when this incident occurred.  The ceiling and all insulation had to be replaced and a major environmental clean-up had to be performed to correct this incident."	Subsequent to the foregoing incidents, because of the greatly increased flow restriction, it was (and still is now) necessary for the facility to pump the sewer line every third day at a cost of approximately five hundred dollars per pumping activity.  "	Enclosures (10) and (11) are schematic and aerial view of the planned activity to repair the sewer line.  Issues impacting this repair include the fact that the collapsed line runs directly under the handicap ramp area of the front entrance into the Reno facility.  As shown on the two enclosures, additional impacts are in the City of Reno street and crosswalk from the parking area to the building due to the location of the sewer manhole and the equipment necessary to accomplish the repair.  The repair requires a 30 foot long by 14 foot deep trench to be excavated so a sleeve can be inserted into the sewer pipe and pulled through to the manhole up on the second level of the entrance area where the collapse occurred - the total length is approximately 100 feet.  It has taken many days of investigation with cameras and cable lines within the sewer line to determine the extent of damage and possible alternative to completely shutting down the entire front of the hospital and tearing up all the steps and handicap access to replace the entire line.  This alternative has proven successful in several areas within the City of Reno and is determined to be the least impact to our patients, staff and visitors as well as cost."	The longer the period necessary to award the contract, the more cost incurred by the facility for the periodic pumping activities.  Notwithstanding, the imperative circumstances of repairing an already damaged sanitation system, to take a less expeditious path would greatly increase the risk of more breaches to the system, thereby, endangering the preservation of sanitation and health of the hospital.6.	As permitted by PL 109-461, this solicitation will not be announced in FedBizOpps, and competition is not sought.7.	The anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable to the government based on past prices negotiated with this company on other projects performed here at VAMC Reno and at other VA facilities.  Additionally, the company is currently performing work in the Primary Care area doing renovation under minor construction which will help minimize mobilization costs and more importantly, enable the project to be completed promptly.8.	Market research information was obtained by pulling up awarded procurements listed in eCMS for VA work which shows the contractor has contracts awarded in VISNs 20 and 21. (See Encl (1))9.	Full and open competition will not be utilized for this contract as permitted by PL 109-461 and, supplemented with the reasons stated in Paragraph 5 above. 10.	The proposed contractor, Glen-Mar Construction, is a SDVOSB contractor whose current performance has been more than satisfactory.  A copy of the Dun & Bradstreet Report (Encl (2)), VetBiz Registration (Encl (3)) and CCR Registration (Encl (4)) are attached.  This company qualifies under the requirements of the IL-049-07-08 for sole source award as a SDVOSB.11.  I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. M.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-97-H-5004-0002.<br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<CONTACT>Sandra G. Emerson, Contracting Officer, Phone 9727612596, Fax 703-465-4386, Email saemerson@fdic.gov
<DESC><p>The services to be provided by the Contractor include, but are not limited to, the following five stages of work: (The complete Statement of Work is attached)
<p>1. Assist the FDIC during the Acquisition Stage - Most of the ORE is acquired at the failure of financial institutions (bank closings). Other sources of ORE are foreclosure actions, settlements, deeds in lieu, and Discovered ORE Assets. Contractor may be required to assist the FDIC in developing a plan to manage ORE prior to a bank closing. Contractor is required to attend the closing of the financial institution to inventory and gain control of the ORE and Other Owned Assets, create 6-part files for each ORE asset and set up assets in Contractor's inventory system. Thereafter, Contractor will either remain on site for a specific period of time or move the files to the Contractor's location at the sole discretion of the FDIC.</p>
<p>2. Prepare ORE property for Marketing - This stage encompasses ensuring that the FDIC is the owner of the ORE property and that title can be conveyed. The Contractor is required to obtain services such as valuations (appraisals or broker's price opinions), title work, insurance, and environmental assessments, in order to prepare the ORE property for marketing. Some assets acquired may be Unmarketable and the Contractor shall be required to use their best efforts to make them Marketable.</p>
<p>3. Manage ORE - The purpose of this stage is to secure and manage the ORE in a manner that will minimize losses, maximize recoveries, and mitigate liability to the FDIC.</p>
<p>4. Market, Sell &amp; Close - In this stage the Contractor shall expose ORE properties that are marketable to the broadest market possible, and negotiate and dispose of the ORE properties at the highest return possible within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>5. Research Potential ORE - This stage involves conducting research in response to inquires on properties to determine ownership (Discovered ORE assets). It may be necessary to research public records. Typically the FDIC receives inquiries from investors or taxing jurisdictions claiming that the FDIC owns certain ORE property. The FDIC's goal is to provide top quality customer service to the public and to respond to Discovered Asset inquires in a timely basis. Each request will require searching the FDIC's databases and warehouse records to ensure that the ORE property is owned by the FDIC and was not previously disposed by the FDIC. Access to FDIC systems and records requires Contractor and subcontractor security clearances as described in the Agreement.</p>

<DESC>Recommendations: Before performing any roofing operations, first remove the spalled and loose concrete from the interior of the tilt-up panels exposing the corroded reinforcing (approximately 460 SF). Clean a minimum of 1/2" around the reinforcing steel and at ends, wire brush the steel to remove the corrosion. Coat the reinforcing steel with three component, solvent free moisture tolerant, epoxy modified, cementitious product specifically formulated as a bonding agent and anti-corrosion coating or an approved equal. Patch the areas with a two-component, polymer modified cementitious, and non-sag mortar flush with the adjacnet surfaces or an approved equal. Add micro silica to the concrete mix for patching the concrete walls. Apply three coats of water repellent/water seal to the entire interior of the parapet walls per manufacturer's instructions. Caulk the joints of the tilt-up panels with an approved material. Install new corner flashing, backer rod and caulking. Upon completion of the tilt-up panel work, remove the existing membrane roofing, insulation, flashing down to the deck and remove the roof hatch. Thoroughly clean the deck of debris, install a vapor retarder sheet, install a base sheet over the sheathing paper, and install two plys of 60 mil modified bitumen single-ply roofing membrane with cold process mastic. Install tapered insulation to provide a 1/4" per foot slope to drain water to the roof drains. (6,000 SF) Install a new roof hatch and flashing. Additionally, patch the holes in the hard rubber coating on the gym roof with the same coating or urethane spray. (approximately a total of 20 SF or one SF in 20 different places)

<p>The experience of the offeror and of proposed subcontractors and/or partners intended to occupy a major role will be considered in evaluation and selection. The government will evaluate each offeror's corporate experience in providing services, which are of similar nature to the work to be performed under the requirement described in this solicitation. Specifically, jobs that are of similar scope, complexity, contract type, and period of performance, in relation to the requirements of this solicitation are of particular interest to the government. The government reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews to validate corporate experience and to obtain additional information from other internal and external sources, if known</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>

This will include obtaining information/documentation on the occupants who are currently living in the housing units such as their address and contact information, what work has been performed to date, as well as any work that needs to be completed before they are transferred to the new contractor. The phase-in plan shall include a timeline with dates and key tasks to be performed starting with contract award up to acceptance of the first twenty (20) units and what steps will be taken during that time to achieve phase-in and assume regular maintenance and deactivation requirements (i.e. finalizing subcontracts, if applicable; hiring new staff if necessary; training staff on the contract requirements; setting up a service call center finalizing internal standard operating procedures to be used in performing the contract requirements, finalize draft plans, etc.)</p>

This plan will detail how the offeror plans to manage to work (i.e. how work will be staffed, how work will be accepted/issued, what procedures will be followed to ensure work is being performed in a timely manner and of high quality, what corrective action of measures will be taken when work is not preformed in accordance with contract terms and conditions/QC plan, etc.).<br /><br />NON-TECHNICAL FACTOR</p>
<p>1. Price (Non-Technical Factor): Contractor is to demonstrate the ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the services identified within the solicitation. The government will evaluate the offeror's price for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>(a) Price is evaluated by using a weighted average obtained by multiplying line item prices by historical usage rates for each line item.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 test program procedures for commercial items.  Simplified acquisition procedures will be followed.  (ii)  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (iii)  This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity commercial supply reagent rental contract.  (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation Request for Quote is being issued as a full and open competition.  (v)  This requirement is for The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center Microbiology/Molecular laboratory which requires a Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Genotyping system using Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR) to conduct HCV genotype testing. Hepatitis C virus infection is relatively prevalent amongst the US veteran population and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Determination of viral load and viral genotype (there are 6 main HCV genotypes) are routinely used laboratory guides to clinical management. Our laboratory performs viral load determination and genotyping assays in-house and serves as a reference lab to the VA system. Existing genotyping methodologies require prior PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid, which is most commonly and most efficiently, accomplished using the very same PCR reaction that is also used for viral load determination in the performing laboratory.  We have performed HCV genotyping for many years, however, the current procedure uses components that are classified as RUO (Research Only Use) by the US FDA. We have to change the methodology because we cannot continue the RUO methodology without greatly increased cost and complexity.  (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: Contractor to provide a Hepatitis C Virus genotyping system. This requirement consists of five line items, one for each period of performance:  The contractor shall provide a Reagent Rental price for each period of performance. The genotyping estimated annual volume is 360 tests.  If contractor charges a cost per kit price, in lieu of cost per test, the contract shall provide the number of tests per kit.  The pricing for this line item shall include ALL COSTS FOR PROVIDING THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE REAGENTS, CONTROLS, AND COMPONENTS described below.  (vii) Shipping will be FOB destination, therefore, shipping of all items must be included in the price for the line item.  (viii)  The selected contractor must be able to deliver all requested equipment by June 30, 2009.  Deliverables and acceptance of the deliverables for the system and all components, reagents, controls, etc. will be FOB destination Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Attention:  Microbiology/Molecular Laboratory, One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55417.(ix) The effective period of the contract shall be date of award through twelve months, with options to extend the contract for four (4) additional years.  The contract, including all options years will not exceed five years or 60 months.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) Q8825090025. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. FAR clauses and provisions enclosed within this RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-28 and are available in full text through Internet access at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. This procurement is designated as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $12 M per year.
By order of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) Central Valley Region, the El Portal Wastewater Treatment Facility is directed to analyze for Priority Pollutants and Dioxin 17 TCDD congeners, on its receiving water and effluent. The State Water Board adopted the Policy for Implementation of Toxics Standards for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries of California (known as the State Implementation Policy or SIP).  The SIP states that the Regional Water Boards will require periodic monitoring for pollutants for which criteria or objectives apply and for which no effluent limitations have been established.  Accordingly, the Regional Water Board is requiring, as part of this Order, that the Discharger conduct annual (1/Year) effluent monitoring (Monitoring Location M-001) and receiving water monitoring (Monitoring Location R-001) of priority pollutants.  Priority pollutants are defined as USEPA Priority Pollutants and consist of the constituents listed in the most recent National Toxics Rule and California Toxics Rule.  The Discharger must analyze pH and hardness of the effluent and receiving water at the same time as priority pollutants.
NPS employees will collect the samples required by the NPDES permit and drive	them to a certified lab.  The lab needs to be within minimum driving distance, about 90 miles maximum and/or 1.5 driving hours, from the El Portal Wastewater Treatment Facility as the samples must stay within a specific time frame and temperature.  There are approximately 40 samples taken from the river and plant effluent which must then be put into a cooler with controlled temperature.  There is also a limited time frame for the samples once collected to be received at the certified lab.  
The analyses shall be performed at a laboratory certified by the CA Department of Health Services.  The laboratory is required to submit the Minimum Level (ML) and the Method Detection Limit (MDL) with the reported results for each constituent.  The MDL should be as close as practicable to the USEPA MDL determined by the procedure found in 40 CFR Part 136.  The results of analytical determinations for the presence of chemical constituents in a sample shall use the following reporting protocols:
a. Sample results greater than or equal to the reported ML shall be reported as measured by the laboratory
b. Sample results less than the reported ML, but greater than or equal to the laboratory's MDL, shall be reported as "Detected but Not Quantified" or DNQ.  Estimated chemical concentration of the sample shall also be reported
c. For the purposes of data collection, the laboratory shall write the estimated chemical concentration next to DNQ as well as the words "Estimated Concentration".  Numerical estimates of data quality may be by percent accuracy (+/- a percentage of the reported value), numerical ranges (low to high), or any other means considered appropriate by the laboratory.
d. Sample results that are less than the laboratory's MDL shall be reported as "Not Detected" or ND.
The list for Dioxin monitoring 17 TCDD congeners, see attached Table 4.  The laboratory shall report the analytical results of the effluent monitoring for each congener, including the minimum quantifiable level (ML) and the minimum detection level (MDL) and the measured or estimated concentration.  The laboratory shall multiply each measured or estimated congener concentration by its respective toxicity equivalence factor (TEF) value and report the sum of these values.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation 2109-359J-WA183 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 811310.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. 

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer contractor questions:<BR><BR>Question 1.) While working on the pricing for the laundry and sewing services I noticed that on item number 0002CL (Modular sleeping system, 3 Pcs) that there was<BR>an estimated annual quantity of 2000 Pcs for black or green sleeping bags<BR>and 2000 Pcs for the black stuff bags. The 3 Pc modular sleeping system we<BR>are familiar with consist of a black intermediate bag, a green patrol bag, a camo bivi cover and a black stuff bag to contain the 3 Pcs. Should I price for these four items at 2000 Pcs? There is no item number for the bivi covers.<BR><BR>Answer 1.) Yes, 2000 qty for all 4 pieces and the item no. for bivy<BR>cover is misc. DA6553.<BR><BR>Question 2.)  On the Sewing Services there is only one item number. We have experienced variations as follows, Only embroider name and/or US army<BR>tapes, embroider name and/or US army tapes and sew on Velcro, or sew patch<BR>directly on to uniform. We have different pricing for each variation. Which is correct?<BR><BR>Answer 2.) Embroider names and us army with Velcro sewn on back.

<p>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the question received prior to the cutoff date listed in the notice.</p>
<p>QUESTION AND ANSWER</p>
<p>Q1) I have one question regarding power supply. It is stated that the system must operate on either 120 Volt or 230 Volt power. We would like to be able to offer a system which requires 3 phase power (of any voltage, normally 208 or 480 Volt is available). Is that possible in this case?</p>
<p>A1) No. The FBI requires that the system must be able to operate on either 120 volt or 230 volt power (+/- 10%)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS 

TO PROVIDE GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF CONCRETE PAD FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AN EXPLOSIVE STORAGE MAGAZINE AT SEATTLE-TACOMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - (SEA) 

 
1.0	Purpose

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) National Explosive Detection Canine Team Program (NEDCTP) is committed to establishing safe, secure repositories for training equipment related to the Proprietary Canine Program. To this end, NEDCTP desires to install and maintain an explosives magazine at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.  To achieve this goal, NEDCTP requires this site be prepared for receipt and installation of this magazine.

1.1 Background

TSA is contracting with airports to install explosives storage magazine facilities to be located on or near airport grounds. Each facility will house explosive storage magazine(s) that will safely and securely hold the TSA-approved explosive training aids which are required to train and maintain the proficiency of the TSA explosives detector canines.

1.2 Technical Requirements/Task 

The Contractor shall be responsible for investigating the site for utilities, preparing design drawings for approval, constructing a concrete pad, installing a grounding rod, an encompassing barricade, roof, erecting enclosure fencing, access gate, and associated lighting if necessary.  The construction deliverables are to meet requirements set forth in ATF 5400.7, as well as the following Tasks:

A.  Pre-Construction:

The Contractor will investigate the proposed construction site to locate any utilities, and to ensure that the location will not hinder existing utilities.  

The Contractor will produce engineering drawings based on the construction details in Section B, below. Drawings will need to be submitted to the Port of Seattle for approval prior to the commencement of construction. 

Drawings will need to address:
•	All materials to be utilized
•	Any water valves and sewer clean outs at the site

B. Construction

Task 1: The contractor shall construct, at minimum, a gravel, crushed stone or DGA base (free draining material) twenty-eight (28) feet wide by forty (40) feet long by four (4) inches deep. The sub-grade must be compacted to meet the ASTM standard of 95%.

Task 2: The contractor shall construct, at a minimum, a smooth/brushed finished concrete pad twenty-eight (28) feet wide by forty (40) feet long by six (6) inches thick at 3,500 pounds per square inch (PSI).  This pad is to be reinforced with 6” X 6” 10/10 welded wire fabric or fiberglass reinforced.  It is to conform to (ACI) recommendations and local building codes.  

Task 3:  The contractor shall install two (2) .75 inch by ten (10) foot copper clad grounding rods at opposing ends of pad. Exact location will be determined before start of project.  These grounding rods will be provided by customer. 

Task 4:  The contractor shall construct, at a minimum, an encompassing barricade, either natural or man-made, in accordance with ATF 5400.7, Subpart B, Definitions (see Artificial Barricade and Barricaded). This barricade must meet the standard to conform to ATF 5400.7, Section 55.218 - Table of Distances for Storage of Explosive Materials.  The outer edge of the barrier must be two feet from the concrete pad edge on all sides. This barrier serves to contain or deflect a blast in the event of an unexpected detonation of the explosives storage magazine.  The contractor shall build one roof with a minimum of six (6”) inch overhang on all sides.  The roof shall contain a sloping angle and proper drainage material.

Task 5:  The contractor shall erect enclosure fencing and access gate.  This fencing and access gate defines the outermost perimeter of the explosives magazine compound, and serves to restrict access solely to authorized personnel.  Specifications will be finalized during contract negotiations. The fencing must be a minimum of seven (7) feet in height with at least three (3) rows of barbed or razor wire held in place and set at six (6) inches apart across the top of the fencing. The gate locking mechanism must have a lockable drop rod assembly with inset.

FAR 52.222-6 Davis-Bacon Act (Jul 2005) 

(a) Definition.—“Site of the work”— 

(1) Means-- 

(i) The primary site of the work. The physical place or places where the construction called for in the contract will remain when work on it is completed; and 

(ii) The secondary site of the work, if any. Any other site where a significant portion of the building or work is constructed, provided that such site is— 

(A) Located in the United States; and 

(B) Established specifically for the performance of the contract or project; 

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this definition, includes any fabrication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., provided— 

(i) They are dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to performance of the contract or project; and 

(ii) They are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the “primary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i), or the “secondary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this definition; 

(3) Does not include permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, or tool yards of a Contractor or subcontractor whose locations and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, yards, etc., of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the Project site, are not included in the “site of the work.” Such permanent, previously established facilities are not a part of the “site of the work” even if the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively or nearly so, to the performance of a contract. 

(b) (1) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR Part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or 
cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) Alcon Laboratories Inc., 6201 S Freeway, Fort Worth, TX 76134-2001 as the only responsible source that can provide an Infiniti Phacoemulsification Machine.  This machine will be used to perform cataract surgery in the Operating Room (OR) on board ship.  

 In compliance with the Command’s initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for shipboard applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Infiniti Phaco Machine manufactured by Alcon Laboratories Inc.  The installed equipment is currently onboard and in compliance with the Command’s initiative to enhance Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) for shipboard applications.

Based on the above information, it has been determined that the only technically acceptable Infiniti Phaco Machine is manufactured by Alcon Laboratories Inc.

Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all its components shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America; even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p><strong>5/18/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received another question which is included in the attached response.</p>
<p>Also, CDC has made&nbsp;changes to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) which&nbsp;are included in the attached Amendment (i.e. SF 30).&nbsp; Offerors shall acknowledge the Amendment as per instructions contained in block 11 of the SF 30 (attached).&nbsp; The changes in the SOO are located in paragraphs 9 and 10.&nbsp; The proposal due date remains the same.</p>
<p>____________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/18/09 notice _______________</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, water, and wastewater collection systems at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s).  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via the utility system(s), including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, and improvement of the systems.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Access.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Hill AFB is located in the Salt Lake Valley west of the Wasatch Mountains and overlooking the Great Salt Lake to the west, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) is seven (7) miles south of Ogden, Utah, and 35 miles north of Salt Lake City.  The Main Base occupies approximately 6,689 acres – 6,641 fee and 48 leased (primarily railroad). Outlying installations include the Little Mountain Test Annex (approximately 26 miles northwest of the Base) and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR; approximately 50 miles due west of Hill AFB).  In addition, Hill AFB supports 5 smaller satellite areas within approximately 200 miles of Hill AFB.

Electric:  The Main Base has 827 buildings occupying 12.6 million square feet of floor space, not including the privatized housing.  The Base has a 13,500-foot runway that handles more than 40,000 takeoffs and landings annually.  It also has 228 miles of roadway and 28 miles of railroad.  Electrical power for the Main Base is supplied by two Rocky Mountain Power (RMP)-owned 46-kilovolt (kV) transmission feeders and one RMP-owned 138-kV transmission feeder.  The Air Force owns the entire Hill AFB electrical distribution system downstream of these three RMP delivery points.  The Air Force system consists of one 46-kV switching station and approximately 6.8 miles of overhead 46-kV transmission line supplying four 46-12.47-kV distribution substations, one 138-12.47-kV distribution substation, and approximately 132 miles of 12.47 kV primary distribution line.  There are approximately 6.8 miles of 12.47-kV primary distribution line under-built on the transmission towers that support the 46-kV transmission line.  The distribution system is a 12.47/7.2-kV, 4-wire configuration throughout Hill AFB.  The primary distribution system consists of a total of twenty-nine 12.47-kV circuits.  It is composed of overhead, pole-line construction (conventional, cross arm/pin insulator, open wire construction practices) with pole-mounted transformer banks, and underground construction (utilizing duct-type construction practices) with both outdoor pad-mounted transformers and indoor primary unit substations.

Potable Water:  Hill AFB receives water from two sources: on-Base deep wells and from the off-Base Weber Basin Conservancy District (WBCD).  The Delta aquifer is the major source of water for Hill AFB.  The principal water-bearing zone varies from 50 to 150 feet in thickness at a depth ranging from 480 to 520 feet below ground surface.  Although acceptable for consumption, water tends to be “hard” and contains iron, calcium, sodium, and magnesium.  The supplemental water source (WBCD) supplies treated water to the Base at a single point near the South Gate entrance.  A contract between Hill AFB and WBCD, dated 12 December 1952, requires WBCD to provide 1,018.79 acre-feet per year (approximately 333 million gallons).  The contract also requires that WBCD have available 2,500 gallons per minute (gpm) at the point of delivery and that not less than 1.5 million gallons per day (gpd) be available.

Wastewater:  The Hill AFB wastewater collection system consists of approximately 258,620 feet of wastewater collection lines, varying in size between 3 to 15 inches, and approximately 662 manholes.  The wastewater collection system dates back to the 1940s.  In the older areas of the Base, the wastewater lines are vitrified clay pipes and the manholes are constructed of brick.  Since the 1990s, as lines were replaced and new lines added, the replacement piping has been PVC and the new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete.  Depth of burial for wastewater collections mains ranges from 6 to 30 feet.  Average depth of building service laterals is approximately 6 feet.

This requirement is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Interested sources should contact Dale Stephens at dale.stephens@dla.mil to be added to our bidder mailing list.  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at Federal Business Opportunity and the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after May 28, 2009.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) program is conducting an analysis of image generators to determine if we should 1) continue delivering CFFT systems with the current image generators, 2) if we should integrate a new image generator into the CFFT systems that have not been delivered, or 3) if we should purchase new image generators for all CFFT systems.  The analysis will focus on 1) the capabilities of the image generator today, 2) what functionality would need to be developed to meet the program requirements, and 3) cost.  The result of the analysis will be a decision on which approach to take with the CFFT image generators and which products would best meet the requirements of the CFFT program.  If it is decided to integrate new image generators into the CFFT systems, the integration would start in October/November 2009.<BR><BR>The total number of CFFT systems to be delivered is approximately 405.  Of the 405 total systems, approximately 155 systems have been delivered to date.  These systems are delivered in 1-to-4, 1-to-12, and 1-to-30 (instructor-to-student) configurations.  The 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations require 3 image generators.  The 1-to-30 configurations require 4 image generators.  <BR><BR>For the 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations, an image generator is required for the enhanced student station which provides Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) views; a second image generator for the Stealth system at the Instructor Operators Station; and the third image generator for the rendered real-world scene projected on a classroom screen.  The 1-to-30 configuration has an additional image generator for additional field-of-view on the classroom screen to accommodate the larger student number.<BR><BR>The key parameters that will determine the approach the program takes are the following:<BR>"	Low cost visual system<BR>"	Reduce Life Cycle cost<BR>"	Leverage SE CORE database generation and models<BR>"	Compliance to the JFPL Standards<BR>"	Integration schedule compliance<BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a delivery order under PEO STRIs STOC II contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.505.  The Government will make the award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  <BR><BR>The contract type has not been determined at this time.<BR><BR>QUANTITIES: There will be 33 1-to-30 configurations delivered; the remaining systems will be 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 for a maximum total of 1,248 Image Generators.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: Maximum of $12M<BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUIRED: STOC II contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity must respond by the closing date above to the contract specialist listed below.  The Government reserves the right to eliminate STOC II contractors that fail to respond by the closing date above from further consideration for potential award.  <BR> <BR>Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following:<BR><BR>a.	Completed Vendor IG Response Table. (Attachment A below)<BR>b.	A statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015.<BR><BR>The response is limited to paragraphs a-b above and should not exceed six (6) pages.  Any additional information will be discarded without review.   The information provided needs to define the current functionality/capabilities of the product that you would recommend to this program.  At this time no cost information is being requested.  A point of contact for the CFFT team can speak to concerning your product and costing of the product is requested.<BR> <BR>It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document no later than 3:30PM EST via email to adam.baldwin@us.army.mil on or before May 29, 2009.  <BR><BR>This Sources Sought is being posted on both the PEO STRI Business Opportunities Portal (STRI BOP) and to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  If responses are received from STOC II contractors only, the Government reserves the right to follow STOC II Request For Proposal procedures as outlined in the STOC II User Guide if and when the RFP becomes necessary.<BR><BR>Written questions may be submitted by electronic mail to the technical point of contact below specified below.  The Government requires that all questions be received by 4:00 p.m. EST on 15 May 2009. Once all responses are completed, they will be disseminated via amendment to this Sources Sought. <BR><BR>NOTICE: STOC II contractors are advised that the Government may use a streamlined, multi phase process or evaluation factors in accordance with FAR Part 16 to determine if contractors will proceed to the next stage, and ultimately submitting an offer to be considered for award.<BR> <BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. <BR><BR>Contracts POC: Adam Baldwin, (407)-208-3342, Adam.Baldwin1@us.army.mil		<BR>Technical POC: Jill Ashby, (407) 384-3854, Jill.Ashby@us.army.mil <BR><BR>UPDATE - 18 May 2009<BR><BR>Questions and Responses on the Image Generation and Analysis Sources Sought<BR><BR><BR>Question:  Could I please receive some clarification on Compliance to the JFPL Standards?<BR>Response:  The following is the JFPL Approach:<BR>"	JFPL architecture is a requirement-down, component-up approach to a family-of-systems architecture<BR>"	Product Line Attributes for all Joint Fires requirements are captured, decomposed and allocated to Functional Capabilities<BR>"	Functional Capabilities are mapped to JFPL Systems and further decomposed into Subsystems and Components<BR>"	To define a product, requirements flow down from the Product Line Attributes to Functional Capabilities, these are then matched to specifics in the System and Subsystem level to determine which JFPL components and fidelity are required for the specific configuration of JFPL product<BR>When the CFFT II team was asked what JFPL compliance would mean to an image generator, they provided the following 'need' which is in the Response table:  Capable of being controlled by a framework that determines if the IG scene is rendered on the entire screen or only a portion of the screen. For more information on JFPL and to request a copy of the Standards, contact Mr. Glen Loupe at: glen.loupe@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Question:  In regards to PEO STRI's potential requirement for image generation analysis and solutions for the CFFT.  I was just curious if this was new work that PEO STRI was looking for or whether a contractor in the past had been fulfilling this.  Do you know if any previous contracts existed to provide this work?  <BR>Response:  Based on the information received in response to this RFI and potential discussions with vendors and programs using different image generators, an image generation analysis will be conducted for CFFT.  This analysis will be conducted in-house by PEO STRI Government employees.  No contract is contemplated for the analysis.  At the completion of the analysis, a recommendation will be provided to the CFFT program manager who may or may not decide to procure image generators based on the analysis.<BR><BR>Question:  What is the current IG being used?  <BR>Response:   FidView by Fidelity Technologies Corporation.  FidView is based on Tiltan of Israel.<BR><BR>Question:  What is the database format that it uses?<BR>Response:   FidView uses a unique format specific to the image generator.<BR><BR>Question:  Who is building the databases for this training device?<BR>Response:  Current databases have been built by Fidelity.<BR><BR>Question:  Do you envision this new IG being able to utilize CDB?<BR>Response:  No.  <BR><BR>Question:   Does the trainer currently use the SE Core products?<BR>Response:  CFFT does not currently use the SE Core products, but the requirement to use the SE Core products is part of Increment II.<BR>Question:  Can you tell me what CIGI 3.0 with JFPL prototype extensions is and point me to the specification?<BR>Response:  The document defines parameters/controls for the JFPL prototype that were not included in CIGI 3.0.  The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.<BR><BR>Question:  It was not clear to me but are we supposed to provide pricing in the a, b documents?<BR>Response:  No pricing is requested at this time.  After reviewing the responses to the table (a) and the statement request in (b), a request for information in accordance with the STOC II Guide may be requested  which may include a request for pricing.<BR><BR>Question:  How many customer references do you need?<BR>Response:  Preferably no more than 10.  The customer references should be for customers and systems that have purchased and used the same image generation configuration that is discussed in the table.<BR><BR>Question:  Are our answers kept confidential from other vendors?<BR>Response:   The answers to questions on the Sources Sought will be posted on the STRIBOP and FedBizOpps.  The responses you provide in the Vendor Table will be kept confidential if you so request.  <BR><BR>Question:  The 3-page response and the ImageGenerationVendorResponseTable.docmust both be submitted on the 29th of May, correct?<BR>Response:  Since the Vendor Response Table requested that several capabilities be discussed, it is anticipated that the number of pages for the table would grow from 3 to no more than 6 (to encourage brief discussions).  The statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015 can be provided at the start or end of the table, just so long as it is part of the 6 pages.  The response is due 29 May.<BR><BR>Question:   Google produces no results for CIGI 3.0 JFPL extensions. Is this a new specification?  Will it be made public by the CIGI review board or is it intended for custom applications?   There appears to be no public record of this specification.<BR>Response:  At this time there is no public record of the JFPL extensions.  CIGI 3.0 should still be available on line.  The extensions were to be submitted to the CIGI review board, but they have not been submitted yet.  The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.<BR><BR>Question:    If you choose to keep using the existing IG would you consider allowing customers to request other IGs as an option if the IG vendor would pay for all of its own integration costs into the CFFT device?<BR>Response:  That would be a program management decision.<BR><BR>Question:    Is there any consideration given to IG's that have already been integrated and used in the CFFT trainer?<BR>Response:  The image generation analysis will be conducted using the responses to this Sources Sought.  <BR><BR>Question:  Is source code required for the IG to be delivered to the program or escrow with the government or are commercial products acceptable?<BR>Response:  Commercial products are acceptable.<BR><BR>Question:   Can you consider having a competitive fly off with actual artillery or JTAC operators evaluating the candidate IG's<BR>Response:   At this time there is a Sources Sought only.  STOC II procedures will be followed for any further actions. <BR><BR>Question:  Do your IG estimates account for replacing the existing IG's should you choose another system?  It did not appear as if your calculations for the total estimated IG's accounted for replacing the existing systems should you choose a new IG vendor.<BR>Response:    According to the information received from the CFFT team, they have a current commitment to deliver a total of 405 systems.  Approximately 155 systems have already been delivered.  Of the 405 systems, 33 systems have 4 image generators each, and the remaining 372 systems have 3 image generators each.  According to my calculations, that would equal 1,248 image generators.  <BR><BR>Question:  What is the current price of the existing CFFT IG per unit?   Does this include all labor costs to make extensions?<BR>Response:   Cannot provide the information.<BR><BR>Question:   Does your existing IG charge for maintenance?  If not, how are modifications, extensions etc then paid for?   Are they done at no charge by the IG vendor for the life of the product or do you pay direct labor for such enhancements?<BR>Response:   CFFT is maintained under the Warfighter Focus contract.<BR><BR>Question:  Can you tell us the per unit IG cost in terms of percentage additional cost that you pay for new features?<BR>Response:   Cannot provide the information.<BR><BR>Question:  Would you consider a fixed annual maintenance fee to provide unlimited enhancements to the product?<BR>Response:  Not at this time.  This is a sources sought only.<BR><BR>Question:   Does the number of fielded units make any difference in the assessment?<BR>Response:  No.  The number of different customers/programs and their appraisal of your product will be taken into consideration as part of the analysis.<BR><BR>Question:   What is the current installed base of the current IG?   Is the current CFFT IG used outside the program?<BR>Response:  Do not know.<BR><BR> Question:  Where can we read about the current IG on the internet?  Is there a published list of its capabilities?<BR>Responses:  We have not found any information on the current IG on the internet.  We are not aware of a published list of its capabilities.  For this analysis, the evaluators are using knowledge gained from involvement with other close-air-support systems to understand what IG capabilities are needed and the Increment II requirements provided by the CFFT team.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the Operating System, is a cross-platform solution required?<BR>Response:   Yes.<BR><BR>Question:   Regarding CIGI 3.0 with JFPL extensions, where can references to these extensions be found?  Please expand the JFPL acronym.  <BR>Response:  The document defines parameters/controls for the JFPL prototype that were not included in CIGI 3.0.   The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.  JFPL is an acronym for Joint Fires Product Line.<BR><BR>Question:  What is meant by being JFPL architecture compliant?<BR>Response:  The following is the JFPL Approach:<BR>"	JFPL architecture is a requirement-down, component-up approach to a family-of-systems architecture<BR>"	Product Line Attributes for all Joint Fires requirements are captured, decomposed and allocated to Functional Capabilities<BR>"	Functional Capabilities are mapped to JFPL Systems and further decomposed into Subsystems and Components<BR>"	To define a product, requirements flow down from the Product Line Attributes to Functional Capabilities, these are then matched to specifics in the System and Subsystem level to determine which JFPL components and fidelity are required for the specific configuration of JFPL product<BR>When the CFFT II team was asked what JFPL compliance would mean to an image generator, they provided the following 'need' which is in the Response table:  Capable of being controlled by a framework that determines if the IG scene is rendered on the entire screen or only a portion of the screen. For more information on JFPL and to request a copy of the Standards, contact Mr. Glen Loupe at: glen.loupe@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Remote Activation/Deactivation, how remote is this requirement?  From a directly connected host?  From somewhere else on the simulation network? Etc.  Please define remote.  <BR>Response:  Activation/deactivation using the host or instructor station application software on the simulation network.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Remote Activation/Deactivation, does the remote activation function imply that the system needs to be able to join an in-progress simulation/exercise?<BR>Response:  Yes.<BR><BR>Question:  Does Remote Activation/Deactivation imply power on/off?  Or does it mean to put the monitor in wakeup/stand-by modes?<BR>Response:   Yes.  Remote activation/deactivation does include power on/off powered via wake-on LAN.<BR><BR>Question:  Under the IG Functionality section, what is meant by IG Software Label?<BR>Response:  The product name of your image generator.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Adjustable Gamma, under what conditions is this functionality needed?  Is this mostly a tuning function?<BR>Response:  Yes, the adjustable gamma is mostly a tuning function, primarily for sensor simulation.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding # of Transparencies Supported, what is the intent?  Is the request to identify the levels of translucency (i.e. 16, 64, 256, etc.) or the types of translucency (i.e. screen-door, contour, etc.)?<BR>Response:   The request is to identify the levels of translucency.  Any additional information you want to provide, as long as it fits within the 6 pages, will be reviewed..<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the Symbology capability, what are the driving requirements?  For example, is it desirable for symbology to be a video overlay?  Is it desirable for symbology to be a part of the rendered scene?  <BR>Response:    Symbology is required to simulate the military equipment that is included with the CFFT.  Currently the CFFT includes simulated Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR), Night Vision Goggles (NVG), and binoculars with reticle.  For this simulated military equipment the symbology is part of the rendered scene.<BR><BR>Question:  Is the symbology expected to be controlled via CIGI?  Is a separate symbology API desired?<BR>Response:  Yes, it is expected for the symbology to be controlled via CIGI.  The JFPL extensions include controls for the current simulated military equipment.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the ephemeris model, is an accurate earth curvature horizon depression required?  How critical is the start field alignment?<BR>Response:  A realistic looking earth curvature horizon depression is required.  The sky should include correctly sized stars, but star field alignment is not a requirement.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the illuminating light sources, what types of lighting are required (i.e. Per-pixel, Per-vertex, light maps, static/dynamic, shadow-casting, etc)?<BR>Response:  Image generators are frequently configured to match the requirements of the customer and the cost.  For the image generator configuration that you would propose for the CFFT - keeping in mind that the image generators are used to render the simulated military equipment scene, the stealth scene, and a single projector and a key parameter is low cost visual system - what features in the database would have illuminating lights? <BR><BR>Question:    Regarding illumination flares, what is meant by complexity of the visible screen?  Does complexity in this sense imply glare, shadows, and similar advanced effects?<BR>Response:  Complexity of the visible screen is asking for a description of the rendered scene.  For example, we support 10 simultaneous flares with a desert scene, no features and no moving models; or, we support 4 simultaneous flares in a flat urban area with 50 geo-typical buildings, light tree scatter and 10 models moving.  Your description can also include advanced effects.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the support for ground clamping of models, are multiple ground clamping modes required (i.e. rigid body, dynamics model, etc.)?<BR>Response:  No.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the screen control framework, does this imply that the IG will not own the display (i.e. not full-screen mode)?<BR>Response:  Yes, that is correct.  <BR><BR>Question:  Does PEO STRI anticipate a short term future demo, is a prototype desired with the study, or is it merely focusing on an analytic study with estimated costs?<BR>Response:  No demonstration or prototype is anticipated, neither time nor money will allow this approach.  The analysis will be conducted using the information received from the Sources Sought and possible discussions with vendors.<BR><BR>Question:   Does PEO STRI anticipate integration of a system in Oct/Nov or development starting then followed by integration.<BR>Response:  We anticipate integration of a production image generator into the CFFT systems starting Oct/Nov.<BR>

<DESC>Department of Defense (DoD) Project Manager- Mobile Electric Power (PM MEP) for four Improved ECU variants: 1) 9,000-Btu/hr, 115 volt, single phase, 50/60 Hertz; 2) 18,000-Btu/hr, 208 volt, 3 phase, 50/60 Hertz; 3) 18,000-Btu/hr, 230 volt, single phase, 50/60 Hertz; and, 4) 36,000-Btu/hr, 208 volt, 3 phase, 50/60 Hertz. The acquisition will be executed in four phases. First, a full and open competitive acquisition will be conducted, culminating in award of up to two Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for performance of parallel IECU Phase I development efforts, with availability for ordering further development and production. During Phase I, the two selected contractors will separately perform twelve month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Delivery Orders for the Phase I of System Development and Demonstration (SDD). Phase I will include design and fabrication of two prototypes of the 9,000-Btu/hr, 115 volt, single phase, 50/60, and two prototypes of the 18,000-Btu/hr, 208 volt, 3 phase, 50/60 Hertz, as well as limited testing to evaluate the contractors' performance. Following completion of Phase I, the Government intends to conduct a down-selectbetween the two Phase I contractors; and select one to perform a twenty-four month Phase II CPFF Delivery Order requiring completion of SDD efforts on all four IECU variants. During Phase II, the contractor will be required to design, fabricate, and test eight prototypes per variant to total thirty-two prototypes. Additionally, all four variants will be subjected to Product Qualification Test (PQT), Logistics Demonstration, and User Evaluation.  Technical Data Packages (TDPs) and Electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs), along with other logistics documents, will be developed and validated for all four variants. Phase III will be a Delivery Order for an eight month Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Delivery Order for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), requiring delivery of 60 of each IECU variant. Phase IV is Full Rate Production and will allow for issuance of FFP Delivery Orders for a maximum of approximately 9,460 IECU units. Phase III and IV also include the purchase of initial spare and repair parts, updates to logistics documentation, and user training. The small business size standard for NAICS 333415 is 750 employees. Small business subcontracting plans are required for all contractors who exceed this standard.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<ARCHDATE>06182009
<DESC>This Justification & Approval (J&A) authorizes the use of Other than Full and Open Competition procedures for the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide charter air and ground handling service to Navoi, Uzbekistan (UTSA).  Korean Airlines (KAL) has obtained exclusive landing and ground handling rights to UTSA for the first six months of 2009.  UTSA represents a strategic logistic point in the current DOD operation in Afghanistan.  The Government of Uzbekistan sought out KAL as its sole external partner to Uzbekistan for the development of Navoi International Airport into a region-wide logistical hub. The current Uzbekistan Airways /Korean Air joint venture agreement, inaugurated at the Navoi Airport on August 27, 2008 specifically grants KAL the following:

-  Exclusive rights to manage UTSA operations effective January 1, 2009.
-  Exclusive rights to UTSA facilities (currently the only non-national air cargo airline sanctioned by the Government of Uzbekistan to operate out of the Navoi airport).
-  Full authority to manage cargo and passenger flights to and from the UTSA.
-  Full authority to develop the airport's adjacent area including commercial, industrial and residential projects.
-  Full government-granted air traffic rights to and from the UTSA.

The requirement is for the acquisition of commercial charter airlift and ground services at UTSA.  The Government currently has a requirement for one B747 aircraft capable of carrying a maximum of 42 pallets/ 90 ton capacity.
