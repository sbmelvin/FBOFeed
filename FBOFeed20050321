Each of the required tasks stated in this announcement requires direct experience in the areas of Human Capital Management, Workforce Analysis and Planning, Employee Development, and development of automated Human Resource Reporting Systems that will assist AoA in the Human Capital program development of management controls and best practices.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine. The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with the only currently known manufacturer of Potassium Iodide in a liquid formulation, Flemming and Company Pharmaceuticals of Fenton, Missouri. A commercial item award, resulting from a written RFP, with a base year and four option years is anticipated. The anticipated award date is on or about March 1, 2005. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to Terrie Nestor at the e-mail address below by January 3, 2005. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis DHHS-ORDC-05-01 may be submitted to Terrie Nestor at (301) 402-6790 or in writing to tnestor@niaid.nih.gov.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Cooper, Contracting Officer, Phone (405)739-7568, Fax (405)739-7422, Email cynthia.cooper@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>This office is currently is the acquisition planning process for the follow-on contract for Vehicle Operations, Maintenance and Analysis.  VOM at Tinker AFB OK includes maintenance as well as vehicle operations.  The maintenance portion of this acquisition covers approximately 1300 vehicles to include sedans, 7, 9 & 15 passenger vans, 1 & 1 ½ ton trucks, pick-up trucks, 28 and 44 passenger busses, fire trucks, 25 and 40 K aircraft loaders, 4, 6, 10 & 15K forklifts, elevator loaders, de-icers, ambulances, dump trucks, M109 utility trucks, Military Design vehicles (M35A1&2, M9230), 5 & 7 ton semi-trailers, 30 & 40 foot trailers, 25 & 50ft cranes, R-11 refuelers and hose carts.  The operations portion of this acquisition includes taxi support, base support, cargo services, wrecker services, shuttle bus services, vehicle control function, fleet analysis, VIP support services, travel license support, Staff Assistant Visits (SAV), renting and leasing of vehicles, and management of over 200 vehicles in the GSA lease program.  There are several changes that the Government is considering for the new acquisition and the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to get comments from industry regarding these changes.  

First:  The Government believes that the current NAICS code of 811118, Other Automotive Mechanical and Electrical Repair and Maintenance, may not be the NAICS code that best represents the complete scope of work to be performed.  The Government is planning to change the NAICS code to 561210, Facilities Support Services, because this NAICS code better represents the complete scope of work to be performed.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside for the new acquisition and is interested to see what small business respondents are interested in this acquisition.  
Third:  One of the provisions of the current contract is for the Government to provide vehicles as Government Furnished Material (GFM) for taxi support, base support, cargo services, wrecker services, shuttle bus services, vehicle control function, fleet analysis, VIP support services, travel license support, Staff Assistant Visits (SAV), renting and leasing of vehicles, and management of over 200 vehicles in the GSA lease program.  The Government is anticipating changing this requirement so that the successful contractor will be required to furnish these approximately 70 vehicles.  In addition, the successful contractor will be required to replace contractor furnished vehicles as necessary to meet the serviceability requirement of the statement of work; therefore, it may be necessary for the successful contractor to replace vehicles more that once during the performance of the contract.  
Fourth:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry will be able to have pricing information to account for costs (such as vehicles) during the latter years of the contract.  

Interested parties should provide a capabilities report, including past performance information, for the response to the second question and should provide a specific response to the remaining three questions as applicable.  This response should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Cynthia Cooper via email at cynthia.cooper@tinker.af.mil by close of business on 31 Mar 05.

<CONTACT>Andrew Creedon 202-781-2593
<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to modify sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00024-02-G-5106 with Raytheon Company of 528 Boston Post Road, Sudbury, MA 01176 to extend the ordering period for one year.  The purpose of the BOA with Raytheon is to provide materials and services, as may be required by USN and FMS, for the evaluation, implementation, and proofing of equipment changes, related engineering services and repairs (including emergency repairs), modifications/alteration, overhauls, refurbishment, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and life-of-type procurement of parts and assemblies to support DMS case resolution, and maintenance associated with the AEGIS Fire Control System MK 99, Transmitter Groups for AN/SPY-1A/B/B(V)/D/D(V), and ancillary equipment.  Orders may also be issued for studies, analyses, evaluation and testing, training, and preparation and/or update of documentation (drawings, manuals, and instructions).  Additionally, dep! ot support may require installation and checkout spares (INCO), repair parts, accessories, tools, replenishment of spares and repair parts, and necessary packaging and marking. Raytheon Company, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is the only qualified source to provide the AEGIS Fire Control System MK 99, Transmitter Groups for AN/SPY-1A/B/B(V)/D/D(V), and ancillary equipment and is the only source capable of performing the services in the required timeframe.  Procurement of the aforementioned supplies on other than a sole source basis would prove to be uneconomical for the customer as there are insufficient quantities to offset the cost of qualifying another source.  The modification will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This synopsis is for informational purposes only and the benefit of potential subcontractors. The government intends to solicit and negotiate only with the source identified herein. Parties interested in pursuing subcontracting opportu! nities are encouraged to contact the subcontracting department at the above address.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Gatan, Inc., 780 Commonwealth Drive, Warrendale, PA, to replace the HCR optics stack, ultra sensitive, US 400D 300kV for the government owned Gatan Energy Filter, GIF2002 an integral component of the Government owned Polara 300K electron microscope,.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The improved Optical Stack for the GIF2002 post column Energy Filter is designed for a higher sensitivity which will allow the NCI to record the same image with fewer electrons thereby improving the resolution. This is a critical parameter in electron tomography as each of the 140 tilted images required for the reconstruction can now be recorded at a lower dose with higher resolution. This increase in sensitivity is particularly important in double-tilt electron tomography where images are recorded from two tilt series orthogonal to each other thus exposing the specimen to double the electron dose.  The replacement part is a major component of the FEI Polara microscope and shall be compatible with the existing system to maintain operability and consistency in research studies.  The Polara 300kV Field Emission Gun Electron Microscope is a “state of the art” instrument for electron tomography and the replacement Optical Stack for the Gatan Energy Filter is an integral part of the existing GATAN Energy Filter that can only be supplied and installed by Gatan Inc. engineers.  Gatan, Inc. is the only known source that can provide the replacement part required.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracts office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on April 4, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) intends to award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract on a sole source basis, per 6.302-1, a base-plus one 6 month option to Worth Ethic, Carpinteria, California, for continued executive development support for DLA senior leaders as it progresses through critical organizational changes.  The Defense Logistics Agency is undertaking the most significant transformation in organization and business processes in over thirty years.  Advent of the business system modernization program, right-sizing the workforce, Base Realignment and Closure reviews, and numerous other challenges in a war-time environment have left little opportunity for Agency leadership to focus on management review and assessment.  Ironically, this situation is exactly the time that such efforts are needed.  A neutral third-party executive development contractor has been engaged to facilitate executive development for the past two years.  This procurement is to continue performance with the existing executive development contractor (Worth Ethic Corporation).  Worth Ethic Corporation currently provides the following services to DLA leadership (10 total: Flag and SES level) including the DLA Director and Deputy Director: 1. Individual 360 executive leadership assessments, 2. Individual briefing sessions and Agency interviewing; 3. Agency briefing sessions; 4. Individual follow-up coaching – executive level; and 5. Strategic organizational change management.  Proposals are not being requested. The Government POC is Samuel L. Thompson, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Suite 0119, DES-ACA, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060, or by facsimile to 703-767-1172, or by E-mail at samuel.thompson@dla.mil . The anticipated award date will be on or before March 31, 2005.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to award a sole source modification for the addition of a full-time trainer/liaison position, in support of the continuing development, improvement and maintenance of the Clinical Research Information Management System (CRIMSON) of the NIAID. Services will be procured on a sole source basis from the current contractor; Systex, Inc. Systex, Inc. possesses the unique ability to handle this requirement.  

The CRIMSON Clinical Data Management System is predicated on the use of client software that will run in both Macintosh and PC Operating Systems and will produce interfaces with a complexity that XML languages cannot. Systex has developed and maintained the current system using 4th Dimension, GQL, and Sybase software tools.  Systex has extensive experience with cross-platform development and with the development of the orphaned programs currently in use in CRIMSON, such as, Andyne and GQL.  

In addition, the development of database solutions for clinical care and research documentation and data warehousing requires an in-depth knowledge of clinical practice and research documentation standards as set for by institutional and regulatory authorities, privacy and security standards set to protect patient data, data standards for submission of research findings set by regulatory agencies and the environment and personnel who do clinical research and care. Systex possesses the required experience with development of clinical research data management systems that meet the unique needs of the NIAID DIR clinical research program.  The experience of Systex is crucial to the management and maintenance of this system. 

The current contract was awarded on a sole source basis to Systex, Inc. Because Systex, Inc. is the current contractor, and because of their expertise of the CRIMSON system, the Government believes that no other offerors would be available or suitable to provide the additional hours necessary for this contract.  Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Michele DiNatale, Contract Specialist, at (301) 402-5644, or dinatalem@niaid.nih.gov before the synopsis closing date of May 4, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This will be a sole source acquisition of goods and services from Odyssey Automotive Specialty, Wharton NJ. Odyssey Automotive has designed a conversion  package that is perfectly mission-oriented for HLD.  In surveying the market  for competitive suppliers of equal reputation and capability, there are no  reasonable or practical substitutes. Furthermore, the proximity of the Odyssey  factory to HLD Team site, makes on-site inspections of on-going work very cost  practical and test fitting of specialized equipment can be done easily without  shipping the equipment to the factory for fitting, with the potential for risk  damage or loss in shipping. Odyssey has met or exceeded all specifications  requirements in prior conversions by other Picatinny organizations.

<SUBJECT>R--CAPSTONE SEMINAR IN WATER RESOURCES PLANNING
<SOLNBR>W912HQ-05-T-0016
<RESPDATE>040405
<ARCHDATE>06032005
<CONTACT>claralyn sawyers, 703-428-7748
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate a contract on a competitive basis for Capstone Seminar in Water Resources Planning in an accelerated effort to strengthen the diminishing capability in the Corps of Engineers Planning community, t he Headquarters Planning Division and IWR, at the Direction of the Director of Civil Works, joined with the Universities Council on Water Resources (UCOWR) to define a Masters program in water resources planning.  This was part of the overall effort entit led Planning Excellence Program, which was designed to help quickly fill the void left be an increasing number of senior and seasoned planners retiring.  The Masters program was designed to be multi-disciplinary and to include courses in: Water Resource D evelopment: History and Principles; Economic Foundations for Public Decision Making; Mathematical Foundations for Public Decision Making; Environmental Law; Environmental Impact Assessment; and a Capstone Planning Practicum designed to provide case study a nd group work on a Corps of Engineers related planning project.  Once the curriculum standards were established, inquiries were made by UCOWR through their member universities to identify universities interested in developing and offering the COE Masters Program in Water Resources Planning and Management.  The initial universities were: the University of Florida, Johns Hopkins University, University of Arizona, Southern Illinois University, and Washington State University.  Harvard University has recently been added to the list of participating universities.  To date, some 16 Corps students have enrolled in the various programs.  One problem encountered by participating universities has been the Capstone Planning Practicum, primarily because it is outside t he typical course curriculum in that it relies heavily on a Corps of Engineers case study and practical application of theory to the case study. Purpose: The purpose of this Scope of Work is to solicit to develop the Capstone Planning Practicum course that would be used by all of the universities offering the COE Masters degree in Water Resources Planning and Management.  Each of the universities that have attempted to develop and present this course have been dissatisfied with the outcome.  Once developed, each of the participating universities will be invited to participate in the lecture portions of the Capstone course as well as the on-line por tions.  Task 1. Course Design Document  The overall course design must be drafted and negotiated among interested parties (USACE, and the UCOWR).  This will involve decisions on course objectives, the length of residence and online sessions, the lecture schedule f or the residence session, tentative identification of lecturers and other contributors, etc.  The result will be a course design document incorporating syllabus, course and module objectives, textbook and reference materials, schedule, and other materials as needed.   Task 2. Lecture Outlines.  The course document will specify the number of formal lectures and the overall topic of each.  However, in order to ensure that the course incorporates all relevant material and that the lectures are reasonably coordinated, it wi ll be necessary to develop topical outlines for each session, together with lists of specific learning objectives.  These outlines will be prepared in draft form by the course development team, then elaborated and finalized with the assistance of the relev ant lecturer.  The learning objectives must be stated in a way that permits objective assessment of student achievement.  Task 3. Case Study Development.  A suitable case study must be identified and prepared for use in the course.  The case study should illustrate a large, complex planning problem, which spans a number of disciplines and issues.  If possible, the case study should be drawn from recent experience of the Corps of other water resource planning agency, although it may be modi fied, redefined, and/or truncated so as to preclude the use of pre-existing analyses and to be manageable in the course time available.  Background materials, source documents, and data should be readily available for students' use.  In addition, backgroun d lectures must be planned and developed.  These lectures will be presented during the residence session in order to prepare the students for the issues that will be addressed in the case study.  Task 4. Online Session Development.  A plan will be developed for the online session, utilizing the capabilities of a known web server.  The plan will include decisions as to which communications media will be employed, how interactions among students will  be facilitated, what interim work products will be required, etc.  The plan will also specify the form of the final product, and the means for determining the contribution of the individual students.  It is anticipated that a panel of experienced water pl anners will review the final work product, will provide a critique, and will participate in the grading.  Task 5. Course Delivery.  The course will be offered for the first time with continuing support from and monitoring by the Corps of Engineers.  It is estimated that five (5) outside lecturers will be utilized for one day each.  The remaining lectures will be presented by the host University staff, and/or Corps of Engineers staff, at no additional cost to the Corps.  Schedule to Complete: Task 1: Course Design Document  -  30 days from NTP Task 2: Lecture Outlines  -  60 days from NTP Task 3: Case Study Development  -  120 days from NTP Task 4: Online Session Development  - Concurrent with Task 3  - 120 days from NTP Task 5: Course Delivery  Target Date July/August 2005 FAR provisions apply 52.204-7, 52.204, 52.213-4,DFARS 52.219-7011, 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003, 252.243-7001, 252.246-7000.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration on Aging (AOA), Office of Administrative Services (OAS), through the Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to award, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1, a sole source contract to Mr. David Dunlap of Falls Church, Virginia, to provide Human Capital and Workforce Analysis support services.  The goal of this simplified acquisition is to provide technical consultation and assistance to OAS Human Resource staff to prepare and implement the AoA Human Capital Strategic Plan, processes development, report writing for human capital issues required by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), to develop technical data and establish automated data tracking mechanisms for capturing workforce data trends and to forecast workforce requirements.  Each of the required tasks stated in this announcement requires direct experience in the areas of Human Capital Management, Workforce Analysis and Planning, Employee Development, and development of automated Human Resource Reporting Systems that will assist AoA in the Human Capital program development of management controls and best practices.  Stated below are the four qualifications required in the statement of work.  1. Expert knowledge of the program activities of the Human Capital and Workforce Planning of the Operating Divisions of the DHHS with particular emphasis on the Human Resources operations of DHHS; 2. Expert knowledge of the operating procedures of DHHS with particular emphasis on the Department’s requirement to meet the President’s Management Agenda as related to Human Capital; 3. Proficient understanding of the Department’s program management strategies as they relate to major workforce analysis and planning, forecasting staff requirements and conducting studies to include analysis of employment trends and issues; 4. Expert understanding of the most recent revisions to the President’s Management Agenda and program management in the Federal Government to include the Human Capital initiatives, employee development and various personnel program and initiatives.

As a national expert on HHS Human Capital initiatives with over 30 years experience dealing with all facets of Department of Health and Human Services human resource activities, including those of the Administration on Aging and its other Operating Divisions, Mr. Dunlap alone has the unique qualifications and expertise that would allow the project to be completed in a timely fashion and with information relevant to government policymaking.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any other vendor but David Dunlap would result in a significant increase in cost.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 2:00 pm EST, April 8, 2005.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements to the referenced address within 15 business days after the date of publication of this Notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking proposals from sources interested in submitting an offer to provide Geostationary operational Satellite, series R (GOES-R) Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) services.  

Previously, a FedBizOpps notice was posted on 29 Nov 2004 (Reference-Number-NE-EK0000-5-00033) asking for acquisition strategy recommendation white papers from industry and announcing an Industry Day for 13 Dec 2004. That Industry Day was held, and documents resulting from that event are found at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/.     Subsequently, and as discussed at that event, a partial draft RFP for the GOES-R PDRR effort was released for industry recommendations on 30 Dec 2004, and a more complete draft RFP (RFP No. DG133E-05-RP-1034) was released on 28 Jan 2005 (with recommendations due to the Government by 17 Feb 2005). All of these documents are available at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/.     

At this time, the Government has finalized the RFP including all exhibits and attachments, and is posting it herewith.  (RFP No. DG133E-05-RP-1034).  The finalized RFP and all exhibits/attachments are also available at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/index.php.  Up to three, Firm Fixed Price awards are contemplated.  Each award will reflect a 6 month basic effort to conduct work leading up to a System Requirements Review (SRR).  The awards will also contain an option to acquire an additional 6-months of services leading up to a System Concept Review (SCR), and another option for an additional 10-months of services culminating with the conduct of an Interim Preliminary Design Review (IPDR).  The combined total period of performance, if all options are exercised, will be 22 months.  All responsible sources are invited to submit an offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFP.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine. The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with the only currently known manufacturer of Potassium Iodide in a liquid formulation, Fleming and Company Pharmaceuticals of Fenton, Missouri. A commercial item award, resulting from a written RFP, with a base year and four option years is anticipated. The anticipated award date is on or about March 1, 2005. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to Terrie Nestor at the e-mail address below by January 3, 2005. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Solicitation No. DJJM-05-RFP-0326, to acquire up to 73 parking permits on a full and open competitive basis, is canceled.  In lieu of contracting for parking spaces, the Department of Justice has decided to reopen negotiations to lease the entire parking facility at 600 E Street, NW, Washington, DC.  Because it will take at least 6-months to effectuate the lease, the Department intends to negotiate a short term contract with LAZ Parking, LTD, the current operator of the parking facility at 600 E Street, NW, to bridge the gap and ensure continuity of services.  The contract will be for a 6-month period plus an option to extend up to 12 additional months should additional time be required to finalize the lease.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this  time.

This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources  capable of meeting the requirements for providing a Consolidated Healthcare  Asset Management Program (CHAMP).  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  and Air Force Material Command Services Capability Package are attached to  provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Air Force  Material Command and the respondent’s potential ability to meet the  Government’s requirements. The medical equipment and real property maintenance support includes, but is  not limited to the maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) necessary to keep  medical facilities and biomedical equipment at nine (9) Medical Treatment  Facility (MTF) locations in good working order.

The objective of the CHAMP is to reduce equipment maintenance  expenditures and provide a fixed annual budget.  This program will replace  manufacturer and third party service contracts with a comprehensive management  services program that combines the cost control protection of service  contracts with administrative and technical expertise.  The Air Force anticipates utilizing an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity  contract for this award. The period of performance for this effort is expected  to be one base year with four one-year option periods.   All respondents are required to certify if they currently meet the small  business requirements under the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) code 561210 Facilities Support Services, $30M, as of the date of their  proposal submittal. This requirement is a set aside for those contractors that  meet the small business NAICS 561210 certification requirement on the date of  contract award, not when they last renewed their GSA Contract.  All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly  demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort.  The  capabilities package requirements are to be presented in accordance with the  attachments entitled *Capabilities Package For AFMC Support Services.  Your  package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance  relevant to the requirements cited above.  Your Capabilities Package should  not exceed 10 pages and should include the following:  Company Name; Address;  Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL;  If applicable Certification of small business status;  Please submit your responses to ASC/PKWIE, Attn:  Cherie W.

No facsimile responses will be accepted.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this  synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with  preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does this issuance restrict the  Government’s acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to  reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this  announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part  of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and  present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.   If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a  solicitation will be published and posted on the Federal Business  Opportunities website.   If you have any questions, you may contact Cherie W. See at (937) 257-4774 ext  4411, e-mail: cherie.see@wpafb.af.mil or the Contracting Officer, Deborah A.

<DESC>CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DART, located in Cincinnati intends to negotiate with Particle Instruments, LLC to procure for a Standard 10 lpm ELPl-01; ELPl Electrical Filter Stage; Vaccuum Hose (1.5m) pressure value & NWIG flange connectors; Vaccuum Pump SV25B, 115 1/60 Hz for 10, 20 & 30 lpm impactor; and Sintered Collection Plate Set.  The procurement is for a real-time size-selective personal and area sampling instrument for aerosol concentration measurements in the aerodynamic size range of  7 nanometers to 10 microns. The instrument employs a 13 stage, low—pressure cascade impactor, with real—time detection, involving an initial electrical charging stage and subsequent current measurement on each of the 13 impactor stages. A vacuum pump provides the low pressure sampling flow necessary to extend the size range into the ultrafine range. The supplied software runs on a user-provided PC, allowing for data acquisition, display in real time and basic analysis, as well as control of instrument parameters. The instrument can be used in the lab or in the field. By placing sampling media on the stages, subsequent gravimetric, chemical and morphological analyses can be performed. Also, by turning the charging unit off, aerosol charge can be measured.  In addition to the real-time sizing capabilities, the product can provide the charge vs. diameter on aerosols in real-time.  Further project requirements are to determine mass vs. size, morphology and chemistry of ultrafine particles, which the ELPl will allow for in conjunction with other apparatus.  Firms that believe they can provide the required equipment are encouraged to identify themselves and give written product information to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please address all inquiries to Margaret L. Mooney at CDC/PGO/AAFB/Pittsburgh, (412)386-6431 or E-mail zia3@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Geodetic Solutions, PO Box 223761, Carmel, CA 93922, for the development of Geodetic software.  NOAA's requirement is for software to use in the development of statistical analysis of adjusted observations involved in the new general adjustment of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), scheduled to be done in 2005.  By accessing binary and SCII data files generated by the NGS adjustment, the software required will compute adjusted unknowns, residuals to the observations, and various statistical analyses of the formal errors propagated into all components of the adjustment.  These statistical values are necessary to compute both local and network accuracies for unknowns and observations in the adjustment.  These components include the covariance matrix of the adjusted observations, partially normalized residuals, and standardized residuals.  The statistical values will then be used to compute both local and network accuracies for unknowns and observations in the adjustment.  The software will be flexible enough to offer various tools and options to NGS analysts in the post-adjustment analysis of the national adjustment.  The software will offer a command-line interface, will be platform-independent, and will run on both UNIX and PC-based operating systems.  The contractor will also be required to train National Geodetic Survey employees in the application of the new software.  Based on the prior market research conducted, Geodetic Solutions has been identified as the only source holding the unique combination of experience, skills, and abilities to develop the software required by the National Geodetic Survey.  Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Geodetic Solutions under the authority of 41 USC253(c)(1), responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. Responses must be received by March 28, 2005. Responses may be emailed to crescent.moegling@noaa.gov, faxed to (301) 713-0806 or mailed to DOC/NOAA/OFA NOS/NMFS/OAR AMD, 1305 East West Highway, Station 7607, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

<DESC>In partnership, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institute on Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), intend to extend the work of the Visible Human Project (VHP) to finer levels of resolution, combining gross anatomy and microanatomy by acquiring data of a specimen of an entire human organ with resolution sufficient to resolve cellular structures.  NIDDK is especially interested in developing new techniques for studying the distribution of the islets of Langerhans, the insulin producing cellular clusters in the pancreas, to improve our understanding of the organization of this complex organ and to help guide future research in endocrinology and diabetes research.  Together, the NLM and NIDDK expect to secure expert services for the acquisition of a whole organ, specifically a human pancreas, physically sectioned at resolutions on the order of 10 microns (10-6 meters) across the entire organ and the exposed sections mounted on slides for subsequent staining and photographed with sufficient resolution to resolve structures at a matching scale of 10 microns.  As the resultant dataset will be reassembled into a 3D representation of the specimen from the collection of slices, the successful contractor(s) will be responsible for handling the image processing tasks for the initial reconstruction of the target volume from the photographic slices.  Image capture may be done with a combination of confocal as well as conventional imaging or involve other techniques.  The contractor may immobilize or fix the sample and may include fiducial markers, rulers/measurement-aids, or other alignment tools in the imaged field to assist with the reconstruction process so long as these structures do not obscure the anatomy and the immobilization does not interfere with histological staining processes.  Since a complete reconstruction of the organ is intended, the successful contractor should not dissect the specimen into small samples for sectioning, but rather be prepared to place the entire specimen on their microtome or other device for acquiring the sectioned slides.  The successful contractor should minimize the loss of any slices in the acquisition process.

The review and award process will follow a four-step process:

1.	A Request for Information (RFI) - Search for Sources will be conducted:  Any offeror or group wishing to participate in the competition process MUST reply to the search for sources.  Potential sources for this work will be asked for examples of their previous work and statements of their capabilities to meet the challenges posed by this project.  A Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) will evaluate the potential sources on their existing facilities, technical approach, expertise of available personnel, consultants, and subcontractors (including pathologists, histologists, computer scientists, image processors, and technicians), and past performance.  NIH personnel reserve the right to visit potential sites as part of the search for sources; however, a site visit is not required for a future award.

2.	A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued for a feasibility study.  Only sources identified as competitive through the search for sources will be solicited for quotes for the feasibility study.  A complete Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) will be convened to make the awards for the feasibility study.  NLM and NIDDK reserves the right to make more than one award for the feasibility study if differing technical approaches warrant the exploration of more than one method.  These/this award(s) will be executed quickly through a Simplified Acquisitions Mechanism under FAR Part 13.

3.	 The Feasibility Study(ies) will be conducted.  The work will be coordinated with research personnel at NIDDK and NLM to help monitor and refine the technique to assure satisfactory subsequent staining and reconstruction of the final datasets.  The feasibility study(ies) will be evaluated on its(their) capacity to meet the requirements for high-resolution, stained, visualization of the Islets of Langerhans in a whole, reconstructed human pancreas.

4.	A Request for Proposals (RFP) for a contract for the complete award will be issued:  Based on the results of the feasibility study(ies), an RFP will follow for the study of a complete organ.  If the feasibility study is conclusive, the NLM and NIDDK reserve the right to execute this final acquisition as a sole-source award having conducted a protracted competition for the project.

Feasibility Study

NLM and NIDDK are proposing a feasibility study for this project.  NIDDK will provide the necessary specimens.  We propose to make an award to demonstrate the technology with the quality and precision required to fulfill the goal of a whole sectioned and stained human pancreas imaged at a resolution of 10 microns.  As such, this pilot study will have the following requirements:

•	Up to 2 sets of 100 contiguous physical sections taken from a whole pancreas specimen (without prior dissection and without loss of any slices).
•	In addition to the 2 sets of contiguous slices, sample full-organ 10 micron sections should be delivered from regular 1mm intervals along the entire organ.  These sections should have the same imaging characteristics as the final product for the contiguous slices.  As stated before, since a complete reconstruction of the organ is intended, the successful contractor should not dissect the specimen into small samples for sectioning, but rather be prepared to place the entire specimen on their microtome or other device for acquiring the sectioned slides.  The successful contractor should minimize the loss of any tissue in the acquisition process.
•	The entire organ should be sliced at 1 mm intervals suitable for imaging at a resolution of 10 microns.
•	Mounting of these sections on slides suitable for H&E histological stains as well as immunohistology for the identification of islet cells.
•	Digital images of the unstained slides with pixel resolutions of 10 microns.
•	Alignment information for reconstructing the collection of slices into a 3D representation of the specimen.  This information should include the initial reconstruction information suitable for rigid registration of the stacks of 2D slices into a 3D volume.  More precise deformable registration is not required and will be the subject of later subsequent research projects.
NLM and NIDDK are specifically seeking contractors with the discipline necessary to conduct this project, adhering to high standards of quality and consistency necessary to both section specimens without loss and with the preservation of the shape and geometry specimen to allow for the reconstruction of the 3D volume.  This process is intended to provide some quality assurance for the later award for the whole organ project.  Regular progress evaluations may be initiated, and frequent interaction with the NIH staff responsible for the histology, microscopy, and deformable registration and reconstruction is expected.

The deliverables for this proposed project are the photographs of the exposed sections, the alignment information for reassembling the image from the mounted slides into a reconstructed 3D volume, and the physical mounted slides of the tomographic sections of the specimen.  The resulting slides and the final data will be owned by the National Institutes of Health and distributed to the public.

Because of the stringent requirements for this feasibility study, the NIH will request sample work from the offering contractors as part of the proposal process.  In addition, the NIH reserves the right to include a site visit as part of the proposal evaluation.  The feasibility study, if successful, will likely be followed by a federal procurement for a whole specimen under a research contract.  Institutions or laboratories offering proposals should consider this feasibility study as an essential demonstration of technical capability for not only the pilot project, but also for the subsequent project for the complete organ.

The requirement for the feasibility study will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.  NLM and NIDDK anticipate that the feasibility study will be completed by the end of July 2005 and costs will not exceed $100,000.  All quotes will be evaluated on technical merit, qualifications of the personnel (including pathologists, histologists, computer scientists, image processing personnel, and technicians), cost, and past performance on research and development projects.  If more than one competitive source for the feasibility study is identified and each submits a successful proposal, NLM and NIDDK reserve the right to make multiple awards for the pilot study. Response to the Search for Sources:

NLM and NIDDK will review the responses to the search for sources based on an evaluation of the responder’s capabilities to execute both the expected feasibility study as well as the planned contract to image an entire organ.  Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) that constitutes the search for sources will evaluate:

1.	Proposed methods for acquiring the data:  The response will be evaluated based on the overall technique.  A complete proposal is not required, but rather an overview of the proposed method.  How does the potential contractor plan to fix the sample?  Will the process require frozen sectioning, embedding, or other immobilization technique?  Does the responder intend to combine confocal imaging with physical sectioning or will the method be based on sectioned slides?
2.	Qualifications of existing personnel:  The response will be evaluated based on the technical merits of the named existing personnel.  Do they have experience in whole organ sectioning and data acquisition?  Do they have expertise in alignment and registration of histological sections into 3D data collections?
3.	Existing facilities:  Since this award process is not intended to provide funds for new equipment acquisition, the responders should describe their current capabilities for acquiring the data for the feasibility study as well as for the complete organ data acquisition.  If modifications of any equipment is required, the responses should describe the extent of the modifications, what capabilities are possible using the current configurations, and what capabilities will be enabled by proposed changes to the equipment.
4.	Past performance:  The responses should provide sources for relevant references of past performance in data acquisition.
5.	Samples of previous work:  The responses should include photographic or digital illustrations and evidence of previous results.  These results should demonstrate the capability of the responder to provide the proposed data with lossless continuity of the tissue sections.

Page Limit:

Responses to the RFI search for sources should be limited to 10 pages of textual information (with figures and tables).  Additional illustrations, photographs and evidence of results (presented in photographs or digital information) must accompany the response.  The total response should not exceed 25 pages (text plus pictures).

If paper copies are supplied, five copies of each response are required.

Due Date:

Responses to the search for sources RFI are due on April 8, 2005.  They may be submitted in writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894; Attention: Karen D. Riggs, Contracting Officer or by email to kr33v@nih.gov.
NLM and NIDDK anticipate that the requirement for the whole organ study will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  A single award is expected for the whole organ study.  If multiple feasibility studies have been awarded, a subcommittee of the Special Emphasis Panel that performed the original review may be convened if necessary to judge the results and determine the award for the final RFP.

Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number NLM 05 070/KDR covering the feasibility study will be available on or about April 22, 2005.  Request for RFQ NLM 05 070/KDR may be obtained by writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894; Attention: Karen D. Riggs, Contracting Officer or by email request to kr33v@nih.gov.  Facsimiles WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE.  Awards for the feasibility study are anticipated on or about May 20, 2005. All sources that responded to the Search for Sources/Request for Information that were found competitive by the Technical Evaluation Group to review sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.

Is Cost Sharing Required:  Yes, this RFP is offering financial assistance funding only.  


Funding Opportunity Description:  

The Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) is a voluntary conservation program that promotes wildlife habitat and environmental quality.  WHIP assists landowners in maintaining and/or enhancing these habitats while protecting natural resources.  

WHIP funds in Oregon for FY05 will be used to fund projects / proposals for the protection and enhancement of habitats for declining populations of species of concern, including state and federal threatened and endangered species on agricultural lands.   

The FY05 WHIP financial assistance funds will be managed as listed: 
•	Distribution goal is 15% tribal and 85% non-tribal.  Adjustments will be made if the goal cannot be met.
•	Will be awarded in a statewide competition consistent with the FY05 Oregon WHIP priorities.
•	At least $180,000 of the WHIP-FA will fund salmonid habitat restoration and enhancement proposals. 
•	Per proposal maximum cap of $150,000.

FY05 Oregon habitat priorities are sage grouse habitat, salmonid habitat and “other at-risk species and habitats”.  Oregon NRCS is requesting proposals for the following priorities listed below: 

1.	FY05 Oregon WHIP Sage Grouse Habitat Priority:

The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for sage grouse habitat conservation, restoration and enhancement proposals are those proposing:

•	Sage grouse habitat conservation and improvement projects on private lands for maintaining current populations through maintenance and enhancement of sage grouse habitat.  The primary habitats of emphasis are Sage Grouse in their current range, located in Baker, Crook, Deschutes, and Lake Counties. Proposals for other counties within the current range will be considered if habitat is in danger of being converted or lost. The current range areas for those counties are shown on the attached map from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Assessment and Strategy for Oregon, dated Dec 30, 2004.

•	Emphasis will be on proposals with existing partnership/planning efforts seeking to implement plans/projects for improving sage grouse habitats.  Such efforts are currently being developed in Baker, Deschutes, Crook and Lake Counties.  Proposals are to be based on the biological needs of sage-grouse and the conservation and improvement of their habitats. 

2.	FY05 WHIP Salmon Habitat Priority:

The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for salmonid habitat restoration and enhancement proposals are those proposing:

•	Salmonid habitat improvement projects that directly benefit the health of salmonid habitats through conservation actions in upland and related riparian areas.   The proposals must be located in relation to “small streams” (i.e., second to fourth order streams) with recognized critical areas and show benefits directly for salmon habitats. These projects may, for example, include plantings (herbaceous, woody), increased buffer size, livestock exclusion, off-stream livestock/wildlife watering, fencing, and plantings. Upland improvements may involve, for example, juniper-clearing, range planting, etc. that benefits the health of riparian areas, water quantity and quality. 

•	Streambank restoration projects in areas that show benefits directly for salmon habitats will be considered provided project design and implementation is covered by a programmatic consultation, such as the Corp of Engineer’s biological opinion for Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered Species (SLOPES) or consultation is done by a third party.   

3.	FY05 WHIP Other At-Risk Species and Habitats Priority:

•	The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for “Other At-Risk Species and Habitats” restoration and enhancement proposals are those addressing:

•	Essential plant and animal habitats designated under federal or state law and locations of listed or candidate species that can be improved or particularly rare and unique habitats that could support at-risk species.  The “Other At-Risk Species and Habitats” proposals are to address these habitats with respect to agricultural lands.  Suggested habitats are native and wet prairie, grasslands, oak woodlands and savanna, and shrub-steppe habitats.  

The selected WHIP proposals will be funded through cooperative agreements. A cooperative agreement will be entered into between the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS); and the selected partner.  This cooperative agreement assists both NRCS and the partner with the implementation of common objectives and mutual interests in restoring and protecting fish and wildlife habitat within the state of Oregon. In the agreement NRCS and partner agree to combine their resources to ensure that wildlife habitat in the State of Oregon is restored and maintained.

Upon execution of this agreement, NRCS shall obligate WHIP funds for the implementation of wildlife habitat activities. This cooperative agreement is the authorizing document to obligate NRCS funds for habitat development activities as proposed in the selected WHIP proposals.   Each selected proposal will result in WHIP contracts with the respective landowners.  WHIP contracts are generally 5 to 10 year agreements to provide restoration cost share funding at a 75% federal cost share payment.  

NRCS will provide the partner with sufficient information to perform the tasks outlined in this agreement.   Specifically, NRCS will provide technical and other assistance required to develop and implement wildlife habitat development plans under this cooperative agreement.  NRCS will also provide training and information to partners as it deems necessary to ensure program requirements are performed in accordance with current up-to-date information. NRCS will review the development of an O&M agreement in accordance with WHIP regulations and policies for the project prior to performance of work or award of a contract for which NRCS will provide reimbursement under this agreement.  The applicant shall report to NRCS the appropriate data elements associated with the technical services provided to the Department or program participant so that the data can be entered into the conservation accomplishment tracking system.

Partner will design treatments to create the conditions necessary to develop and maintain the habitat functions of the project area.  This assistance will include activities associated with developing the preliminary and final Wildlife Habitat Development Plans (WHDP) addressing the participant's identified wildlife resource needs.  The WHDP will be developed in accordance with WHIP regulations, policies, and NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) standards.  The plan must contain all conservation practices needed to meet FOTG Quality Criteria for conservation management systems and National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH) planning policy specifically as it relates to the participant's wildlife resources.  Practices approved for cost share in FY2005 are identified in Attachment 1. All WHIP agreements and contracts shall be entered and recorded in Protracts with SCIMS information, AD 1155 denoting practices, number of units, cost share rate and total obligation.  As well, progress shall be recorded in the NRCS Progress Reporting System.

Procedures for Applying for Assistance:

The prioritization and funding of proposals will be completed in the following manner:

•	Applicant must submit one original and two (2) copies of their proposal to Chris Martin, Contract Specialist, USDA, NRCS 101 SW Main, Ste 1300; Portland, Oregon 97204
•	A budget is required for each proposal.
•	Applicants are encouraged to visit with NRCS at the respective local USDA Service Center to discuss local wildlife habitat concerns and priorities. 
•	Eligible projects must be voluntary efforts that benefit species or their habitat on lands controlled by private landowners, state and local governmental entities, or Tribes.  
•	Projects in partnership with other persons or entities are a higher funding priority.  
•	Proposals will be competitively ranked and selected based on a point system consistent with FY05 Oregon State Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) Ranking Criteria (attached).
•	NRCS will select the proposals to be funded.
•	WHIP participants are required to be in compliance with the conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, in order to receive WHIP cost-share payments. Therefore, WHIP participants who do not participate in other USDA programs will be required to complete an AD-1026 and comply with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation / Wetland Conservation provisions. WHIP applicants who need to complete an AD-1026 should contact the respective Farm Service Agency office.

Available Funding:

•	Oregon NRCS is offering approximately $600,000 of FY05 WHIP financial assistance funds.   Funding amount is subject to change.  Any additional funding received in Oregon will be added to this announcement.

Authority:  

•	Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171; Federal Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, P. L. 104-127; Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A 
SUB-MICROGRAM WEIGHING DEVICE BASED ON ION ENERGY LOSS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's  Sub-micron Weighing Device by Ion Energy Loss technology.

Most biological laboratories use microgram balances for weighing small amounts of material, such as peptides and proteins. Microgram balances are sensitive to vibrations, humidity and static electric fields, and require frequent calibration. LLNL’s technology for weighing by ion energy loss eliminates these concerns and has been shown to be robust and routinely achieving a lower limit of quantitation better than 0.5 microgram.

The technology presents a significant improvement over existing sub-microgram balances in reliability and ease of use, and would appeal to analytical and biological laboratories anywhere routinely working with small amounts of precious material, such as in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and university research laboratories. The weighing device can be made to mimic conventional balances for individual samples, or scaled up to a 96 or 384-well microtiter format for high-throughput applications. The components for the measurement apparatus are commercially available from several manufacturers and the disposable sample holders can be made from inexpensive plastics.

The technology is the subject of U.S. Patent 6,844,543 and pending patents. 
The weighing device consists of a dedicated alpha spectrometer, software and disposable plastic microcentrifuge tubes or microtiter plates carrying samples on an integrated thin polymer film.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS 
TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A 938nm FIBER LASER AND AMPLIFIER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license the technology for a High Power 938nm Fiber Laser and Amplifier.

LLNL has developed technology for a novel, high power 938nm fiber laser and amplifier.   The 938 nm optical fiber amplifier works in the 900nm to 950nm region of the wavelength spectrum.  The amplifier uses a neodymium doped, germanium co-doped silica glass fiber.   The laser is cladding pumped and is capable of high power output.   Researchers have demonstrated efficient operation of this device.  

The amplifier has the following features:
·	Scalable design capable of high power outputs;
·	Operates at room temperature;
·	Can amplify a narrow bandwidth without non-linear parasitic
interference;
·	Suppresses or eliminates parasitic amplified spontaneous emission at
1088 nm; 
·	Makes efficient use of pump power; and
·	Can be operated in continuous wave or pulsed temporal format.

LLNL researchers have also demonstrated sum frequency mixing schemes using periodically poled materials and different frequency fiber lasers.   This permits the design of higher power fiber laser systems with good reliability which can operate across a wide band of wavelengths.

LLNL’s fiber laser system offers advantages over competing solid-state laser designs.  Bulk solid state lasers require careful optical design to manage the thermal and beam aberrations expected in this type of laser, and such systems will probably require the maintenance services of a laser expert. Fiber lasers are self contained, turnkey units that require minimal maintenance from a non-laser expert.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's 938nm Fiber Laser and Amplifier should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES FROM INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE LLNL’S MAGNETO-RADAR/FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL AND NON-METAL DETECTION, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more licensees to commercialize LLNL’S current patents and a newly allowed, soon to be published patent covering the Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal and non-metal detection, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods technology.

·	The Magneto-Radar is a completely new approach to a motion and range detection sensor for conductive materials whether metal or non metal.  

·	Low-cost potential applications exist in treasure hunting equipment, medical, industrial, mining, security and safety screening, and analytical equipment.  

·	LLNL’s licensed field disturbance technology with range gating has been the basis for other products and other applications such as range controlled radar motion sensor for security application products selling commercially for under seventy dollars ($70) in the quantity of one.

·	MIR and field disturbance sensors provide range to object information while screening out clutter and discriminating from other signals due to the environment, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.

·	The MIR or field disturbance sensors can detect small vibrations, such as from a tuning fork, or steel guitar strings.

·	Varying frequencies and inter-modulation products of induced magnetic field targets may possibly provide more information to distinguish and identify them from other materials or movements.     

·	Materials may possibly be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve by detection at remote distances of very small vibrations such as from a turning fork induced in the targets.  

These technologies and methods relate to employing a portable, low-power, battery operated radar to sense and locate (range to object) even microscopic mechanically excited motion or vibration in objects such as but not limited to conductive and nonconductive bio-materials, including ferrous and non ferrous metals, wherein the mechanical vibration and resonance may be the result of mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, optical or electromagnetic excitation.  In many cases, the aforementioned materials can be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve.



The MIR and field disturbance sensors are range-gated radars, which provide range to object information while screening out clutter, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.  The MIR and field disturbance sensor can be used in three capacities: (1) non-magneto, (2) magneto, or (3) contrast.  When used in the non-magneto capacity, the MIR and field disturbance sensor provides a substantially improved means of detecting stationary mechanically and/or acoustically (ex. for use in detection between walls in a building) induced vibrating and resonating objects and materials.  In the magneto capacity, the magnetically or electromagnetically induced vibration and resonance of an object can be detected via a characteristic double harmonic frequency.  Third, the radar can also detect the target object through microscopic movement resulting from changes in the size, image or contrast of the object.  

The Magneto-Radar using either LLNL’s MIR or the field disturbance sensor is a completely new approach to motion and range detection sensor technology using a bipolar generator, which generates unique double harmonics detectable by MIR or the field disturbance sensor.  The MIR and field disturbance sensors are a new low-cost implementation of a pulse echo radar.  Conventional radar pulses travel at the speed of light and require an oscilloscope for high speed sweeps in even nanoseconds, but LLNL's MIR and field disturbance sensor uses a time expansion technology known as equivalent time allowing it to sweep a million times slower or on a millisecond scale. This range-gated radar operates as a pulse echo system that clocks the two way time of flight of a very short electrical pulse.  It involves using a bipolar magnetic field to induce an eddy current in the target object generating a corresponding magnetic field (detectable phase shift relied upon by traditional metal detectors for determining various materials based on conductivity), transmitting various radar frequency signals to the conductive object, receiving reflected radar signals resulting from motion in the object, and processing the receive radar signals to produce an output signal that corresponds to a harmonic and/or an inter-modulation product of the resonating target object in the magnetic field.  The MIR radar transmits short, ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses and the receiver is designed to only receive signals from a preset range(s) R.  If there are no changes within or at range R, then the integrated return signal remains constant because stationary clutter signals are integrated as part of the constant return.  However, if anything penetrates the shell, it will change the reflectivity in range R, which causes a change in the detectable return signal attributed to motion.  Through doing this as well, the varying frequencies of the induced magnetic field targets can be more readily distinguished and identified from other materials or movements through harmonic analysis.  For example, when the magnetic excitation varies sinusoidally at a frequency F, the resulting resonance of the conductive object may occur at, but is not limited to 2F, providing a unique harmonic signature that is detected by the motion sensing MIR radar (ex. a bipolar excitation frequency of 60 Hz may result in a harmonic frequency of 120 Hz).     

Since the magnetic field of a traditional metal detector must travel out to the object and then couple back to the generator, a sixth order decrease in signal strength versus range results, forming a formidable limitation in range.  In fact, it is estimated that traditional metal detectors can only detect coins and jewelry at depths of only approximately 8 inches.  In the case of the Magneto-Radar, however, induction of the target and magnetic field emanating from the target object can be obtained via use of the coil of a traditional metal detector or via a more powerful custom magnetic field generator.  The strength of the induced magnetic field is usually directly proportional to the detection range.  Significantly increased magnetic field strength can be obtained by generating short duration, high peak power, pulsed magnetic fields, even with traditional metal detector coils, without overheating the coil because of the extremely short duty cycle of the MIR or the field disturbance sensor needed to recognize movement of the target.

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal and non-metal detection, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotes (RFQ).

A.  Requirements:    The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) requires contractor support to provide temporary non-personal services in areas including, but not limited to:  administrative, professional, clerical, technical, scientific, medical and laborer positions.  This requirement is SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY.  Applicable NAICS Code is 561110 with a small business size standard of $6,000,000.   Firms with GSA or other FSS contracts may consider this a request for reduced pricing under FSS requote procedures.  The resulting order will be a three year IDIQ and USUHS will issue a separate task order for each position.  All three years shall be evaluated together.  This procurement is being conducted as a Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.

Detailed statements of work or task statements will be included with each task order.  Usually, the USUHS will locate and recommend a potential individual for each position.  The contractor will then interview for the position, make a hiring decision, confirm the hourly price and make a formal employment offer.  Firms are instructed to propose a multiplier, which will be applied to the gross pay amount for each employee to calculate the hourly price.  Firms may propose a fixed dollar amount that may be charged to cover recruitment and interviewing costs when USUHS does not recommend the employee for a given position.  

Selected contractor shall be able to place an employee on site within 48 hours of receipt of a signed task order.  The contractor and their employee will be paid only for hours actually worked or otherwise authorized.  The USUHS may change the work schedule of any position with 24-hour notice to the contractor.  The Contractor is authorized to bill for designated employees who are to be paid for Federal holidays.

Time Cards – The contractor will develop a time card to document the name of the person, USUHS Department assigned, hourly rate, hours actually worked for the time period, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  This time card will be verified in writing by the employee and USUHS personnel and a signed copy provided to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor will not provide service for any task order in excess of the number of hours authorized.

Invoices – The contractor may bill on a bi-weekly basis and the invoice will contain line item detail for each person.  The line will contain the person’s name and USUHS department, hours actually worked for the time period, the hourly price, the amount being billed, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  Copies of time sheets will be attached to each pay period summary.  The invoice will be submitted to the COTR (in both hard copy and MSExcel electronic format) and payment will be made by VISA purchase card.  

The contractor will be responsible for compliance with all Federal, State and local employment laws and regulations including withholdings, reporting and visa restrictions.  USUHS will provide base access and any required security investigations. On an as needed basis, the contractor will conduct or arrange background investigations and provide for any required occupational health and safety requirements (USUHS will reimburse the contractor for the cost of these investigations, examinations, etc.).  

The USUHS currently secures these services from Jardon & Howard Technologies, Inc. under delivery order #HU0001-05-F-0154.  There are currently approximately 32 individuals working under this order and an offeror should expect to transition most, if not all, of these individuals.  USUHS may rely upon this contract to a significantly greater extent in the future particularly for instructors, who are paid as consultants.

B.  Line Item/Prices

The contractor will supply personnel under the following conditions at the following prices:  (For line items 1 through 4 the firm shall propose a percentage by which the hour price will be calculated for each position.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020 is to address several questions submitted by potential offerors regarding this requirement.

Question: Is the Government seeking competition for this requirement?
Response: Yes.

Question: Is the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, SAP, and its processes and technology being used to provide the comprehensive business management assistance?
Response: GCCS-J PMO does not use ERP nor does it use SAP. Nowhere in the Performance-Based Work Statement does it state that GCCS-J uses ERP or SAP.

Question: Is the ERP system SAP being used on the GCCS program?
Response: No. Please see previous response above.

Question: How important is it for the HubZone to have recent ACAT 1AM program office support experience?
Response: Paragraph 3 of the Performance-Based Work Statement clearly states: "Direct, recent ACAT 1AM program office support experience is essential to execute this PWS."

Question: Solicitation stated: Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Does this mean this is a Simplified Acquisition Procedure ($100K or less)?
Response: Combined synopsis/solicitation HC1047-05-R-4020 has been prepared and posted in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6. But specifically, this requirement falls under FAR Subpart 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items." This subpart authorizes, as a test program, use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $5 million, including options. This requirement is expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold defined at FAR Subpart 2.1 as $100,000.00.

The time and date for submission of any questions as well as the time and date for submission of proposals remains unchanged.

<DESC>There have been several repeat questions regarding this solicitation package; therefore, we are providing the following information for clarification that contain Questions and Answers:

1.  Where is the training being held? 

On-site training must be included in contractor’s proposal.  The Government anticipates that the training will last for two days.  This training should occur NLT one calendar month from delivery of the equipment.   There will be four individuals that will be available to attend the training, that is to be held at Ft. Meade, MD..

2.  Will the training be on-site for software and projectors together?

Yes.  The projectors are "smart".  They have on-board operating systems which need to be taught, as well as, the PJNet Software for maintenance and control.  This all works together as one big system, so it must be taught at the same time.

3.  Does the Government need Planet Software?

This software is not required.

4.  Can they send training software, rather than appear at Ft Meade?

No.  Training must be on site.

5.  Do we need to purchase PJ Net Software?

Yes, but only ONE copy is necessary, NOT one for each projector.   

6.  Is there a separate P/N for each of the following:  Ceiling Mount and Bracket?

No, only one part number is required - RPA213.  This number, according to the manufacturer website, includes both the SLB and RPA brackets.  


7.  Is the Software license for one projector or a separate software package for 80 projectors.

This is for the server/controlling computer only, thus only one copy is required.   These are networked systems (one network) rather than stand alone projectors/smaller, multiple networks.   

8.  Zip Code for Ft Meade?

The complete “ship to” Zip Code is  20755-5620

9.  Is installation labor required for each projector?

No, the Government shall be responsible for installation of the projectors.

10.  Can GSA pricing be provided as their quote?

Yes, you may provide GSA pricing.

Based on the above, we have extended the bid opening until 2:00 p.m. Pacific time on 3 Mar 2005.  

If you have already submitted a quote, please verify if it is correct…or make necessary changes and re-submit.

<DESC>USUHS would like to emphasize the fact that we may rely more on the services of the future awarded order then we have in the past.  All questions shall be submitted via e-mail no later then Monday, February 28th.  

Listed below are questions that have been asked in reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation for temporary employment services, with the answers.

•	With respect to firms that are on GS schedule, it is mentioned that “this is a request for reduced pricing under FSS Requote Procedure.”  What does it mean by requoting procedures?  ANSWER:  As stated in DFAR 208.404-70 orders that are to be for services and the award amount is expected to exceed $100,00.00, must be placed on a competitive basis.  We are required to seek a price reduction from firms that have current contracts with GSA for these services.
•	Is there a bidder’s list?  ANSWER:  This is a request for quotes, there is not a bidder’s list.
•	What is the abstract of bids from the last competition?  ANSWER:  See Above.
•	Which positions are subject to the Service Contract Act?  ANSWER:  The Service Contract Act does not apply, because we are considering FS schedule pricing.
•	Can vendors who do not have a health and scientific past performance in administrative services still submit a quote?  ANSWER:  This is a smiplified acquisition and we are not required to disclose the weight for different evaluation factors.  A firm will have a good chance of award if multipliers are low and their current customers are happy.  We strongly encourage firms to submit quotes.
•	Will the current contractor be eligible to submit a quote, and will they submit a quote?  ANSWER:  The current contractor is eligible to submit a quote, but it is up to them if they will.
•	Who is the program manager?  ANSWER:  The name of the program manager cannot be released at this time.
•	Can we schedule appointments to meet with the program manager and the contract specialist to discuss our capabilities?  ANSWER:  We are not going to schedule any appointments with vendors.  Please include your capabilities with your quote.
•	Will the IDIQ be awarded to one company or multiple companies?  ANSWER:  It will be awarded to only one company.
•	What are the insurance requirements?  ANSWER:  There are no additional insurance requirements, beyond mandated coverage such as Workman’s Compensation requirements and any other insurance that the contractor feels are necessary for liability.
•	What are the differences of the old Statement of Work compared to the current Statement of Work?  ANSWER:  The only difference from the last SOW compared to the current SOW is that Federal holidays will be paid to the contractor direct.
•	What is the average annual salary?  ANSWER:  The average annual salary is $35,841.37.
•	Does the multiplier apply to the amount paid to the employee, or the real cost of employment?  ANSWER:  The multiplier applies to the hourly rate paid to the employee before any deductions.
•	Are there any leanings towards certain small business types?  ANSWER:  No.
•	Given the requirements of federal contractors to now utilize the new ORCA system of online representations and certifications, is it your requirement to also submit a printed form along with the quote?  ANSWER:  The FAR states that “An offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.”
•	What are the specific skill sets which USUHS requires?  ANSWER:  Will be defined as each position is created.
•	How many background investigations have been required in the past 12 months?  ANSWER:  There have not been any background investigations in the past 12 months.  This is a new requirement.
•	What is the projected start date?  ANSWER:  Depends on how many quotes are submitted, length of analysis, negotiation, etc.  We are tentativly looking at mid-April if this is agreeable with the selected contra

<DESC>This amendment is considered final. No more questions will be taken. The closing date for receipt of quotes of March 22, 2005 remains unchanged. The following is in response to additional questions posed since the pre-quote conference: Questions: In the amendment to the solicitation &question regarding permits, authorities and franchises... the question is & if a company does not possess the necessary permits may be partner with a larger company that has the permits and approvals.  Your answer says he may do this. Answer:  The acquisition is set aside for a small business concern. The successful contractor who is considered the prime contractor, is responsible for all documents required by the terms and conditions of the contract. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Question:  The information& SubCLIN 0001AA is incorrect.  We ask you to revise the [quantity] figures in the solicitation and make a new submission date for bids. Answer:  At this point in time, the figures are considered estimates only.  The date of receipt of quote of March 22, 2005 remains unchanged.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Question: Will the fuel surcharge as approved& by the fuel board&be allowed&? Answer:   Yes.  The updated  Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) Fuel-Related Rate Adjustment Policy (TR-12), and its Fuel-Related Rate Adjustment Table, will be incorporated in the contract(s) by modification(s).   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	 Question: &Page 4 [of the amendment of the solicitation] &regarding teaming arrangements. ..New Jersey is one of the services areas & the June 7, 2004 ruling & pertains to Public Movers and Warehousemen... (New Jersey Register, Volume 36, Number 11, NJ Reg  2762 (c ))  In furtherance to this issue N.J.S.A. 13:44D-4.7 specifically addresses this issue of subcontracting, teaming, and other terminology referencing the same issue. Please address these matters. Answer: The contract will be awarded to a small business concern. The successful contractor is responsible for all documents required by the terms and conditions of the contract. There will be no subcontracting plan applicable to this solicitation. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Question:  [Will] a secondary and tertiary&award be made [for identical services]? Answer:  No.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Question:  With regard to my question about CLIN 0007AB (storage-local moves), I do not believe that you have answered the question about the delivery from storage.  Your response only addresses the way storage is to be charged, it says nothing about a cha rge to redeliver the shipment to the member when his residence is available.  Answer:  Services required under Schedule III are as stated in CLIN 0007 and its subCLINs.  These CLINS are all inclusive. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Question:  Your response regarding the storage period says that each period is 8 days.  Does that mean a shipment in storage for a total of 12 days would be billed for 2 storage periods?   Answer:  Maximum is 8 days.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice for solicitation number W91ZLK-05-T-0359 is hereby amended to extend the due date to March 24 2005 no later than 3:30 PM EST.  The following question has been asked: Technically, the advantages of a 15 micron pix el pitch is negligible when compared to a 20 or 25 micron pixel pitch focal plane array; In fact, a reduced pixel pitch often degrades system performance. After more research the Government will accept a 25 or less micron detector pitch.
