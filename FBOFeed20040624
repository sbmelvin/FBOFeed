<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA intends to procure on a full and open competition basis a cost plus fixed fee contract for a spread spectrum, point-to-point, high-rate data link. This procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside.  The objective of this procurement is to develop the software/firmware necessary to provide a bi-directional, full-duplex, point-to-point, high data rate, spread spectrum data link capability; integrate the software/firmware into a hardware demonstration board that will be provided by the Government; and to successfully demonstrate a data link meeting the specifications listed.  The hardware demonstration board will operate using an Intermediate Frequency (IF).  The firmware developed shall be transportable and loadable into the Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hardware demonstration board using Joint Test Action G roup (JTAG) interfaces.  Demonstration of the data link will be required.  Contractors are encouraged to purpose solutions that will shorten development time, for example, modification of existing telephony or data link software.  The link operation will be a point-to-point full duplex link with channel separation achieved via Frequency Division Duplex (FDD).  The link is meant to operate in a point-to-point configuration with one or both points moving.  The data link is not meant for long duration data exchange; instead, maximum throughput is required for a minimum of link up time.  Operational data rates shall be variable in discrete steps within the range of 125 Kbps to 2 Mbps.  Maximum user data rate (data rate after FEC (forward error correction) overhead is removed) shall be no less than 1 Mbps.  The allowable hardware targets, consist of a chipset (AHA4540), FPGA (Strati x EP1S80F1020C5), and DSP (TigerSharc 201).  The software/firmware will be written in AHDL (Altera Hardware Design Language) if the FPGA is used, and in C code if the DSP hardware is used.  If it is required to optimize performance of sections of the DSP code, it is permissible to write the code in Assembly language.  Desired modulation is coherent Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) supporting Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK), or other forms of Phase Shift Keying (PSK).  It is desired to produce a nearly constant channel bandwidth at any of the data rates, thus various spread factors may be employed based on data rate to maintain channel bandwidth.  Offerors should specify the type of spread spectrum techniques that will be incorporated in their proposals.  Chip rates should be chosen to produce, after spreading, approxima tely 40 MHz null-to-null bandwidth (NNBW).  The data link software/firmware should be programmable to accommodate various spreading codes (the system should not be hard coded to only one instance of a particular spreading code).  The desired BER in all instances should be no worse than 1.E-5 (with 1.E-6 as a goal).  Anticipated Eb/No (average bit energy to single-sided noise power density) values range from 6 to 10 dB based on range and data rate.  The link function will include provision for Forward Error Correction (FEC) and physical automatic resend/request (ARQ).  Uncoded BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK waveforms will not meet this goal in all cases so it is anticipated that FEC will be required with as low coding overhead as possible to maximize user data throughput.  TURBO and TURBO Product Codes (TPC) offer good performance with high coding rates (low overhead).  The nominal rates, as  well as a choice on block sizes, should be easily selectable in software with nominal rates greater than 0.75.  The data link must use ARQ methods for resending data that is corrupted or lost by the data link.  The data waveform structure shall be capable of maintaining the link even if no data is available to send over-the-air until a terminate link control signal is received.  The software/firmware will also provide a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) function.  A locked/unlocked signal indicator will also be required to indicate when the link is correctly synchronized.  The data link waveform design must include the necessary pilot sequences or other means for initial acquisition, synchronization, and latency control.  Appropriate buffering for physical (separation distance) latency of packets/frames and software induced latency of packets/frames is required.  Input/ output shall be a TCP/IP interface.  The link function will include variable data rate communication based on measured link parameters.  The receiver software/firmware will perform all other necessary filtering, decimation, and corrections necessary to the data for proper demodulation.  The software/firmware will include control functions for external automatic gain control (AGC).  Maximum coding and configuration flexibility is desired.  The data link must handle frequency dynamics and offsets (Doppler and frequency mismatch) in the carrier recovery process.  The data link should handle +/- 30 KHz of variation referenced to the IF.  The dynamics of this motion are 1) offset frequency due to Doppler effects:  +/- 30 KHz, and 2) potential accelerations:  +/- 1000 Hz/sec.  The Government will require the ability to use the software for its own development purposes and for product ion units.  The production units may require the software developed to be given to a non-Government contractor for Government uses.  Production quantities are anticipated to be approximately 100 units.  Delivery is FOB Destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 22 weeks after contract award.  Award will be made using the Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR).  The solicitation will be issued on or about 12 July 2004 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  The anticipated award date is 30 September 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be submitted to Deborah Winfield, by mail to NAWCWPNS, Code 210000D, 429 E. Bowen Rd – Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 or fax to (760) 939-9651, o r email to Deborah.Winfield@navy.mil.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for services to evaluate and provide feedback to the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Project Team and NASA Langley Research Center on the processes, team dynamics and interpersonal relationships, and mechanisms employed by the NASA’s SATS Project personnel to foster the development of a new public-private partnership and successfully complete the goals and objectives of the SATS Project on time and within budget. The data collection and analysis will span the final three years of the SATS Project, providing a unique opportunity for NASA to understand how a NASA team overcomes project startup problems, makes adjustments in project design and implementation, and successfully implements the project through a highly visible Public-Private Partnership. The detail Statement of Work is attached. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from HR Synergy, the only known source capabable of performing this review and analysis task.  HR Synergy, as a subcontractor under NASA LaRC Purchase Order L70539D, provided the initial assessment of the SATS project personnel.  The contractor used a unique web-based proprietary survey to capture initial impressions and thoughts of the SATS personnel followed by personal interviews.  HR Synergy's insight into the unique requirements starting with the AGATE project (the predecessor to SATS), the initial report, and its'understanding of technology and of public-private partnerships lowers the start-up time and costs to the Government.  The Authority For Other Than Full and Open Competition is 6.302-1. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 9, 2004.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Committee for Quality Assurance , Washington, DC.  
Purpose:
Over the past few years, SAMHSA funded the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for several discrete projects related to performance measurement.  NCQA accredits managed care and other medical and behavioral health provider organizations.  Through NCQA’s HEDIS® (Health Plan Employer Data Information Set), performance measurement data can be accessed from more than half of the nation’s Health Maintenance Organizations and almost ninety percent of all health plans. 
 SAMHSA also funds performance measurement activities of the Washington Circle (WC), a group that has expertise in alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders, managed care, and performance measurement.  For the last several years, the WC has worked to improve the quality and effectiveness of AOD prevention and treatment services through the development and implementation of performance measurement systems in the public and private sectors.  The WC identified seven measures as an initial core set for comparing systems’ performance in the delivery of AOD services to adults, reflecting four domains of the continuum of AOD services, i.e. prevention/education, recognition, treatment, and maintenance.  These domains are comparable to those used in the management of other chronic illnesses.  Of the seven core measures, four are designed to be calculated using claims or encounter and eligibility data that is available from managed care organizations.
Last year,  SAMHSA funded NCQA to partner with WC to modify the specifications of two WC performance measures for adults (initiation and engagement) to allow for the inclusion of the measures into the NCQA HEDIS® 2004 (Health Plan Employer Data Information Set).  The measures are currently concluding their first year of implementation and will yield valuable information about the nature of substance abuse treatment in the private, managed care sector.  Additionally, NCQA developed a technical subgroup to review the theoretical and methodological issues related to the development of performance measures related to children and adolescents.  The subgroup is responsible for advising NCQA on the feasibility of including measures for children and adolescents in the HEDIS®.  
The National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) is the organization responsible for development and implementation of HEDIS.  Their performance measures for treatment and prevention of substance abuse under managed behavioral healthcare committee of NCQA, and its technical performance measures experts have provided comments on the specification of the measures by Brandeis University for the Washington Circle Group.
The NCQA has initiated testing of performance measures for a various health conditions and populations collaborating with a number of their health plans that have research staff and large databases.  The NCQA is able to work with these same plans to test substance abuse performance measures.  It is particularly important that some questions be answered about the measures before they are included in HEDIS; it is also important that the measures be tested not only in comprehensive health plans, as they already have, but in specialty managed behavioral healthcare plans to which only NCQA has access.  Since only NCQA is responsible for implanting the process through which measures are added to HEDIS, it is the only organization that can assist CSAT and the Washington Circle Group to further test the measures for inclusion in HEDIS.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Tactical Aircraft Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC) program intends to procure approximately 167 Digital Map Computers (DMCs) and 51 Digital Video Map Computers (DVMCs) with extension housings.  The acquisition will include engineering investigations and studies involving the TAMMAC system.  The contract will be awarded on a sole-source negotiated basis to Harris Corporation, Government Communication Systems Division and will consist of a base award and two options in January 2005.  The options will include approximately 279 DMC and 194 DVMC units with extension housings. Harris Corporation is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the TAMMAC DMC and DVMC, and is, therefore, the only known source with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment and experience to fulfill the Government technical and schedule requirement for installation of these units in F/A-18 C/D and F/A 18 E/F, AV-8B, AH-1Z, and UH-1Y.  Deliveries are required to be FOB destination to the aircraft manufacturer, and are scheduled to commence January 2006.  This synopsis is not a request for proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Orlando, TSD intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to L3 Communications on a sole source basis for ISDN Hardware and Information.  NAVAIR Orlando has been tasked with developing a communication box for the BFTT training system that will integrate the separate trainers on the BFTT network with the tactical radio communications of the fleet and specifically the new LPD-17 class of ship.  This ship uses an ISDN based communications network with a MARCOM 2000 tactical radio switch made by L3 communications.  In order to develop a communications box that can talk to the tactical radio we have to be able to interface with the MARCOM 2000 over the tactical network.  To this end, we intend to purchase a tactical MARCOM 2000 switch and to utilize it in our lab at NAVAIR Orlando.  This will allow our developers to directly interface with a tactical switch during the integration and testing phase of the development thereby insuring that the design is verified before it goes to the ship.  This acquisition will consist of the MARCOM 2000 switch, peripherals, installation and interface data.  The estimated value of this award is $139,000.  This notice is published to satisfy the requirements of FAR Part 5.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  For questions or comments regarding this notice, please contact the identified contract specialist.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation package will not be issued.  Solicitation number TIRNO-04-Q-MSA07 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) with the evaluation and award prescribed in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This procurement is small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561410 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award and 4 one-year options periods.  REQUIREMENT:  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) Division, Learning & Education (L&E) function requires contractor support for word processing of developed technical course material.  This course material shall be processed using Information Mapping software that uses that “chunking” of information to transform the course material into a readable education format.  BACKGROUND:  Learning and Education Compliance NCFB Group has responsibility for a variety of courses and classes including CPE and specialty programs.  Material for these classes varies in size from 500 hundred pages to several thousand.  Total material for the contract year will range from 15,000 to 24,000 pages.  Approximately 90% of the material will be available in electronic format containing handwritten edits on the accompanying hardcopy.  This material requires word processing (editing, formatting, spell checking, etc.) and must be processed using Information Mapping software.  SCOPE AND PURPOSE:  The IRS shall provide the course material as it is developed.  The contractor shall word process the work and return to IRS for review within two weeks of receipt.  The IRS will review the material, and return to the contractor for corrections.  These corrections shall be completed in 3 business days.  All material produced by the contractor is subject to final approval by IRS.  The IRS will batch the course material in batches of 500 – 3,000 pages.  The contractor shall be located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, as there may be occasions where a courier is needed for prompt turnaround of the materials.  IRS estimates that at least 90% of the developed course material will exist in an IMS word and require conversion to information mapping format.  Small amounts of handwritten edits may also be included.  A small percentage (approximately 10%) may require typing into the information mapping format.  The final product will be course material formatted in Information Mapping and delivered as one hard copy and one CD-Rom per course.  All materials developed under this award are the property of the IRS.  Any materials developed for use on a personal computer must comply with section 508 requirements.  Work shall be performed at the contractor’s location.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS:  The IRS shall provide course materials in an electronic format and access to technical personnel for guidance.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Cir cular A-76.

A thirty (30) day public  review period commences the start of business on Wednesday, 6 November 2002 and will continue through close of business Thursday, 5 December 2002. Documentation supporting the tentative decision is available for review at the Fort Myer Library, Building 4 69, Fort Myer, Virginia. Due to heightened security measures, interested parties should contact Ms. Pamela Walker at (703)696-0910 or Ms. Debra Bonds at (703)696-4166 to schedule review. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to the Capital District Contracting Center, Attn: Mr. William E. Campbell, Jr., Contracting Officer, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101, Fort Belvoir VA 22060-5134.

<DESC>This amendment is to release the solicitation for the U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NEC’s outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT – The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT – The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating country’s export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Government’s export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating country’s specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.

<DESC>This notice is being issued as a result of the cancellation of ED-04-R-0005.  The qualifications have been revised from CMM Level 3 to CMM level 2.  Background:     Congress directed the Department of Education to "assist the States in developing effective methods for the electronic transfer of student records and in determining the number of migratory children in each State" in section 1308 (b)(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).  In particular, in section 1308(b)(2), Congress required the Department, in consultation with the States, to ensure the linkage of migrant student record systems for the purpose of electronically exchanging among the States health and educational information for migratory students.  The linkage of migrant student record systems, including those systems used before and after the enactment of NCLB, is to occur in a cost-effective manner.  Description:  The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Migrant Education (OME), anticipates acquiring the services of a contractor experienced in information technology (IT) and acquisition planning in support of federal agencies, to provide acquisition management assistance in planning, selecting, and managing acquisitions from other contractors and vendors.  In addition to other activities, the offeror will develop a performance work statement for a contractor to design and build a migrant student record linking mechanism that uses leading edge technology to link the existing State migrant student record systems in order for those systems to exchange information on migrant children.  The "linking mechanism" will be referred to as the Migrant Student Information Exchange System (MSIE) in this document.  In assisting the Department to meet its need, the following broad areas may be required:     1.  Developing performance work statements for planned acquisitions; 2.     Assisting with preparation of acquisition documents; 3.  Assisting with technical review of proposals; 4.  Performing feasibility studies of alternatives derived from market research ; 5.  Performing cost benefit analysis of alternatives; 6.  Developing business cases and budget requests; 7.  Assisting the COR with evaluation of existing migrant student record databases in preparation for developing MSIE user requirements; 8.     Assisting the COR with creation of the user and technical requirements for the MSIE; 9.  Attending meetings with State personnel and other customers to gather technical specifications for the planned acquisitions; 10. Assisting with pre-proposal meetings and request for information meetings; 11. Serving as technical advisor during the MSIE software development life cycle; 12. Assisting in the management of contract tasks with other contractors.

It is expected that the successful prime offeror MUST meet all of the following conditions:     1) Offeror has been appraised at Level 2 or higher of the Capability Maturity Model (i.e. for Software (SW-SMM), Integration (CMMI-SE/SW), or Software Acquisition (SA-CMM)) by an SEI-authorized Lead Appraiser.       As part of  its response to the solicitation offerors will be required to submit proof that the business units within the contractor organization that will be performing the software acquisition support work for the Department of Education are operating at one of the following levels as appraised by a CMM Appraisal Framework (CAF) compliant appraisal, including self-appraisals, led by a SEI authorized lead assessor/evaluator:     A.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM) Level 2 or higher; B.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model for Software Acquisition (SA-CMM) Level 2 or higher, or; C.       Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration for Systems and Software Engineering (CMMI-SE/SW) Level 2 or higher.     2) Prime offeror must perform at least 51% of work.     3) Offeror has prior understanding of the technical requirements for the general work to be performed through relevant work within past three years of comparable type and scope.     At least one of the relevant work experiences must have been in direct support of acquisition support or software development requirements defined in a statement of work or statement of objectives by a Federal Agency.

Offeror must demonstrate prior direct experience in planning acquisitions for software development projects in excess of $1 million and/or developing software development projects in excess of $1 million.

All future information about this acquisition including the solicitation and solicitation amendments will be distributed solely through www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation will be open to all offerors and the estimated release date is any time after June 1, 2004.

Note:  The awardee of this contract will be prohibited from competing on any future requirements that it supports as a result of this contract.  Additionally, any resultant software development contract(s) will be supported by a CMM Level 3 organization.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open only to construction 8(a) firms with a bona fide Washington State office.  The Government intends for the Large 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $25,000.  The $25,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $99 Million.  Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000,000 and $6,000,000.  Note, an additional 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $100,000 to $1,500,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
    	Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.  The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.       
 	The SBA assigned number for this procurement is 7700-04-404238.  Joint Venture Agreements are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides and must be received by SBA prior to proposal due date and approved before award of a resulting contract.  If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) as soon as possible.  It is also recommended that the agreement be submitted as soon as practicable to ensure compliance with established regulations.  Any corrections and/or changes needed can be made only when your BOS has adequate time for a thorough review before the proposal due date.

<SUBJECT>R -- Revision and Updating of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles
<SOLNBR>OSD-03-0002
<RESPDATE>071204
<CONTACT>Bridget Hamel, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9521, Fax 410-966-9310, Email bridget.hamel@ssa.gov
<DESC>This IS a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), Request for Industry Comments and Sources Sought Synopsis.  This IS NOT a SOLICITATION.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) is (1) seeking industry comments on its DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) and DRAFT Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria and (2) seeking interested vendors capable of providing access to a subscription for an electronic publication that will provide SSA with updated and revised occupational information for use as a replacement for the Department of Labor’s (DOL) Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT) in SSA’s disability evaluation process. This replacement must be possible without requiring any substantive changes to SSA policy, process or forms. Specifically, SSA is seeking access to a periodic publication of DOT-based occupational information which has already been developed, which is readily adaptable for SSA’s disability evaluation process, which is updated in regular cycles, and which can be shown to meet SSA’s requirements within strict time constraints.  

SSA anticipates awarding a single, 10-year (base year + 9 option years), firm fixed price (FFP) contract to the selected offeror.  This acquisition is being conducted in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, using a 2-phase evaluation process as further delineated in Addendum B to the SF1449, entitled, “52.212-1 Instruction To Offerors – Commercial Items & 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items.”  SSA anticipates issuing a presolicitation announcement in approximately August/September with a Request for Proposal, incorporating industry comments, shortly thereafter (approximately 45 days).  

SSA is seeking information as follows:
1.	Is your company interested in submitting a proposal for the services described within?
2.	A DRAFT PWS is attached which further delineates SSA’s requirements.  Is the DRAFT PWS viable, clear and explicable?  Are there any concerns or areas of uncertainty, which in your opinion, require clarification or correction?    
 
3.	DRAFT Instructions to Offerors and Evaluation Criteria are attached.  Are the instructions and evaluation criteria, written thus far, comprehensible and reasonable?  Are there any concerns or areas of uncertainty, which in your opinion, require clarification or correction?  
 
4.	Do you have any suggestions for improving the DRAFT Instructions to Offerors and Evaluation Criteria and/or the DRAFT PWS?
5.	Through a separately issued RFI (#IE-01), SSA is seeking sources and industry comments from potential offerors to perform the services of an Independent Evaluator (see RFI #IE-01 for details).  Does your company have any recommendations for the types of written documentation to be submitted by your company (subscription offeror), that will best assist SSA and the IE in its technical evaluations?
6.	Do you have any concerns or questions regarding the IE’s RFI?
 
This RFI is not a solicitation and does not constitute a request for proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is strictly for determining capable sources for market research purposes only and for incorporating industry comments into the PWS and Instructions and Evaluation Criteria.  Submission of any information based on this RFI is purely voluntary.  

Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Bridget Hamel, at bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

The position is supervised by the Mission Director and involves participation and work on the Peace Dividend Team.

I.  Background: 

After 20 years, the island nation of Sri Lanka finds itself in transition:  no longer in open, armed conflict with the LTTE but not yet able to enjoy the benefit of a successful reconciliation.  USAID Sri Lanka's strategy for development is similarly undergoing change as the focus of individual programs shifts from working around conflict to working in a post conflict environment.  The adjustment has given rise to several program management and Mission staffing issues which this personnel action is intended to address.  Activities and reporting schedules and new dialogues initiated to identify appropriate responses to the ongoing peace process. USAID Sri Lanka's Humanitarian Assistance Program Manager whose duties and responsibilities are described below will have expanded responsibilities as a result of this transition. 
                      
The authorized position level of USAID Mission to Sri Lanka is 40 positions to be carried out by 3 US DH, 6 USPSCs and 31 FSNs who are organized as follows:

Overview of Sri Lanka Health and Humanitarian Assistance Program:

The Health and Humanitarian Program Manager will focus on monitoring and managing activities being implemented under Strategic Objective (SO), ¡§Improved social and economic integration of targeted disadvantaged groups,¡¨ of the Mission¡¦s Country Strategy for FY 2003-2007.  USAID is concentrating on improving the sustainability and institutional capacity of Sri Lankan organizations to provide services for vulnerable groups.  To these ends, USAID is helping selected vulnerable groups to access these services so that they will be able to lead more productive lives.  

These groups include civilian victims of war, orphans and displaced children, people at high risk of contracting infectious diseases, and those people most susceptible to natural disasters and injury.   USAID¡¦s current Humanitarian Assistance portfolio includes:
 
Disability Support:  USAID is supporting programs that will train physical therapy assistants on wheelchair therapy at distribution centers.  This program focuses on advocacy and employment activities  and , importantly, on providing training and technical assistance  on the production of prosthetics, orthotics and wheeled mobility devices, with added emphasis on assessment, prescription, fit, and post fit care needed by users. These activities are implemented by a USAID-funded organization with local partner organizations in Galle, Kandy, Tangalle, Jaffna, and Colombo.

Support for Displaced Children and Orphans:   The USAID is awarding a grant to fund psycho-social services to your children traumatized by war, conflict and other threats to children and your people including sexual abuse.  This will entail child-centered play activities, preschools and week-end camps that will help children come to terms with the pressures and traumas associated with the conflict. 

Support for Torture Survivors:  In the coming year USAID will assist qualified international non-governmental organizations to fund community-based services to improve the lives of persons affected by violence.

The existing ICBM Command & Control infrastructure is not expected to meet the needs of a future system due to sustainment issues and an anticipated increase in data throughput requirements.  The ICBM System Program Office (SPO) is planning a Research & Development task with whose objective is to assess mature technologies that can be integrated with the existing ICBM C2 infrastructure to improve availability, sustainability, and capacity.   It is expected that this effort will produce detailed test and instrumentation plans to evaluate mature technologies, for example, to test full copper capability of smart HICS multiplexing, 4-wire modems, or something similar, possibly using the Peacekeeper site at the Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) at Hill AFB, to prove viability of this alternative and the actual data rates that may be achievable in a networked environment.  This effort also requires a final report outlining the acquisition and sustainment costs of each alternate technology solution with reliability projections in reference to support, enhanced capability and integration with the existing MM III HICS system.

Potential sources are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities/White Paper by 2:00 p.m. Mountain Standard time by 8 July 2004 to the following address':     Advanced Strategic Missile Division ICBM System Program Office (OO-ALC/LMX), Attn.

<DESC>This is a request for information only. There is no solicitation
package available. NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking product samples for testing and information from sources that may be capable of providing an extremely light-duty mat system in support of the Expeditionary Airfield Program.  Product samples will be utilized for testing.  The contractor providing the samples is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.  Any information obtained from testing will be provided back to the company providing the product sample.  The Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Concept is a shorebased, aviation weapons support system which permits deployment of landing force aircraft within effective range of ground forces. This concept allows for the construction of portable, reusable,
forward-deployed airfields which can be assembled in a building block concept for the rapid introduction of air power. These airfields are fabricated from aluminum panels.  The aluminum panels can be assembled to form an airfield's runways, taxiways, parking areas, and other areas required for aircraft operations and maintenance.  While the existing EAF airfield surfacing system is a highly capable medium-duty, battle-proven system, the substantial weight and cube embarkation profile of this system is time consuming and costly slowly reducing the operational capability and feasibility of deploying this system for all applications.  The direction of the Marine Corps is advancing towards reliance on a small, lightweight MEU concept with heavy use of rotary aircraft such as the CH46, CH53, AH1 and UH1  These aircraft do not require an airfield surfacing system that can 
withstand high impact/wheel loads.

<SUBJECT>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) – TORPEDO ADVANCED PROCESSOR BUILD
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. N00024-04-R-6162: This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Any resulting contractual agreements based on responses to the BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  A formal Request for Propo sals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this announcement is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NAVSEA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.   Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, is soliciting for research proposals that will aggressively incorpor ate flexible, affordable, and innovative torpedo signal processing control beyond its current baseline.  The mission of the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build  (APB) Program is to address rapidly changing technology and constantly evolving threats necessitating the need to redefine the methodology for producing torpedo modifications. The need to identify weapon system shortfalls, select the best solutions, and establish proper feedback processes and tools to enable a data-driven, build-test-build approach to continually improve system performance is crucial.  Primarily, the project’s scope will be defined by the development of torpedo signal processing algorithms involving signal processing, signal detection, signal classification and waveform design. The project will also address Weapon Control improvements and support tasks including combat system interface, communication in terface control, transmit waveform control and internal torpedo communication functions. These tasks support the overall torpedo functionality.  The endstate to the proposed Torpedo APB Program will be the ability to maintain our undersea weapon advantage and thus ensuring maritime access and battle space superiority.  As an introduction to this new process, the Government will host a classified, to the Secret level,  Torpedo APB Program and Related Topics Industry Day.  Interested representatives of Government and Industry are encouraged to attend on Wednesday, 21 July 2004.  No foreign participation is allowed.  The briefing will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport from 8am until 5pm.  General questions about Industry Day should be addressed to Mark Campbell at (401) 832-8080 and detailed questions concerning this BAA or the Torpedo APB progr am must be submitted electronically to Richard D. Braendel II, SEA 02613B, at BraendelR@navsea.navy.mil.  Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via e-mail, by fax or in writing to the following addresses:  Email: campbellma@npt.nuwc.navy.mil Fax: 	(401) 832-1134 Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport Mark Campbell Code 8191, Building 990/2 1176 Howell Street Newport, RI 02841-1708 Information regarding security clearance/visit request and hotel information can be found at: http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil under Visitor Information. Attendance is limited to persons who have registered and have approved security clearances in place. Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests should be received not later than 8 July 2004.  Registration requests will be confirmed by 15 July 2004. The scope of this Broad Agency Annou ncement (BAA) and the proposals solicited are limited and will be used for identifying innovative algorithm processing techniques for future detailed development.  The Navy intends to award up to three (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies, not-to-exceed (NTE) $100K each, from a total BAA budget of $300K.  However, the Navy reserves the right to award more, less or no studies as a result of this BAA.  Awards will be based on the merits of the proposals as evaluated by the Torpedo APB evaluation team.  Depending upon the success of the studies the potential exists for follow-on development contract awards.

Where multiple areas are proposed, proposals should be structured so that each area identified above is separately delineated.  This BAA will be open on 24 June 2004 and close on 19 August 2004. Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period, but must be received no later than 3:00pm EST on 19 August 2004.    Early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged.  The Navy desires initial award no later than 12 October 2004. Proposed studies should identify innovative solutions, technologies, cost drivers, and development approaches within six (6) months from contract award. No award can be made without a proposal to perform a specific effort within an estimated cost and time period.  Industry, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, educational institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Univer sities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions are encouraged to participate; however, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of Naval Undersea Weaponry technology for exclusive competition among these entities.  Proposals should be submitted to the Cognizant Contracting Activity as identified below: Commander  Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Richard D. Braendel II, SEA 02613B  BLDG 197, 5W-2133 1333 Isaac Hull Ave, S.E.  Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376 BAA N00024-04-R-6121 Attn:  Richard D. Braendel II, 02613B Phone:  202-781-0481 DO NOT OPEN IN MAIL ROOM Contracting Point-of-Contact is Richard D. Braendel II, telephone (202) 781-0481,  facsimile (202) 781-4654 and e-mail BraendelR@navsea.navy.mil. NAVSEA is located at the Washington Navy Yard (WNY) where access is  strictly limited in accordance with Naval District Washington (NDW) security regulations.  It is recommended that proposals be mailed in accordance with the BAA instructions.  In the event you prefer to hand carry your proposal, ensure adequate time has been allowed by your representative to accommodate the additional security procedures.  Detention at a NDW gate or failure to adhere to the procedures provided herein will not be considered an exception to timely proposal delivery.  Offerors hand carrying proposals shall call the contracting officer or contract specialist at least 48 hours prior to arriving at the WNY to make arrangements.  Offerors can enter the WNY via the First Street Gate off M Street SE.  Vehicles entering NDW are subject to random searches.  Visitors shall turn left onto Tingey Avenue at the end of the Southeast Federal Center at the second guard shack, sh ow picture ID and follow Tingey Avenue until you have reached the last building on the right, Bldg 197.  Just before reaching another guard shack and before the end of  Bldg 197, you will see a loading dock directly across from the NDW Police Station.  Please pull into this loading dock area and notify your point of contact.  Packages should not be sealed as they are subject to inspection.  Classified material shall be prepared in accordance with current security requirements.  The contracting officer or contract specialist may receive the proposal and provide the Offeror a receipt with the time and date of delivery.  All offerors shall mark each package with the name of the contracting officer and the contract specialist, their codes and phone numbers.   Any proposal, modification, or revision, that is received at the designated Government office after the exact time specif ied for receipt of proposals is “late” and will not be considered unless:  (a)	If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the announcement, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 3:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (b)	There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of proposals and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of proposals; or (c)	It was the only proposal received. However, a late modification of an otherwise timely and successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Govern ment installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the announcement, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the announcement closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the announcement on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. The contracting officer must promptly notify any offeror if its proposal, modifications, or revision was received late and must inform the offeror whether i ts proposal will be considered. NOTE: FULL PROPOSALS SENT BY FAX OR E MAIL WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The Government’s rights in Proposals shall be in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information (Jun 1995), available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars/html/r20040101/252.227-7016. Offerors must submit their technical proposals (10 paper copies and 1 electronic copy using Microsoft Suite) and cost proposals (3 paper copies and 1 electronic copy using Microsoft Suite) within the time period as stated above.  The technical and cost proposals must be provided as separate volumes;  no cost information shall appear in the technical proposal and no technical information shall appear in the cost proposal. Offerors may submit proposals on any or all areas of interest.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the propos als received in response to this announcement.  Offerors must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall address technical and cost/price.  Although length is not specified, succinct proposals are desired. Proposals shall include the following sections, each starting on a new page: A. A cover page, including proposal title, technical, cost and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers and email addresses, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 365 days). B. A one-page overview of the proposed processing improvement and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they wi ll contribute to Torpedo APB and support the objectives of improving signal processing control. C. A one-page summary of the deliverables and schedule including data associated with the proposed research. D. A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific Contractor requirements.  If any portion of the research is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the Contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the requirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the research if the resource is not provided. E. Technical arguments that substantiate claims made in the overview (proposal section B) and a technical approach description consistent with the deliverables and schedule (proposal  section C). Technical arguments should also address any major risk areas. F. A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract.  Include details on any proprietary information, restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data. G. A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas and previous cost and schedule performance.  In order that the Government may verify this information offerors shall include in their proposals points-of-contact by name, title, and phone number. H. A detailed breakdown and summary of cost and price for the effort.  The Offeror shall provide the number of proposed hours by labor category, all direct labor and indirect rates, a breakdown of any material costs proposed, and the proposed fee.  The Offeror shall  also provide a point of contact, to include name, title, phone number and email address, at their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The evaluation of proposals will be performed by the cognizant Program Officer and other naval and defense activities/agencies personnel, including the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport division, as needed.  All evaluation team members will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information. Due to NUWC Newport’s participation in the evaluation of proposals, and in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, proposals from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center will not be accepted or considered for award. Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria: ·	To what degree does the proposal demon strate potential for improving signal and weapon processing control beyond the current torpedo processing baseline (Block IV)? ·	Can the proposed study/development be completed in time to support the Torpedo APB schedule? ·	What is the probability that the proposed study effort will meet the objectives stated in the Offeror’s proposal? ·	Does the proposed study effort appear to be realistically achievable with the funds requested? ·	To what degree will the benefits of the proposed study effort be limited by restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data? ·	What has been the Offeror’s past performance in signal processing algorithm enhancements and weapon control improvements? These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with the first three being significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. At th e conclusion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  NAVSEA will retain and file one copy of non-accepted proposals; all other copies of non-accepted proposals will be destroyed.  Those proposals accepted pending the availability of funds may be considered for funding for up to twelve months after the closing date of this BAA.  Not all proposals evaluated as acceptable will be funded.  Decisions to fund acceptable proposals will be based on funds available and the evaluation criteria set forth in this document.

<SUBJECT>59 -- FPI's FSC Code Change for AM Amplifiers
<DESC>“Under the provisions of FPI’s guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997 in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following “good faith” announcement for public notice and comment.  FPI manufactures amplifier units for sale to the Federal government.  These items fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Code 5895 - Miscellaneous Communication Equipment.   The customer has assigned a different classification code to the AM amplifier and it has been transferred to FSC code 5996 - Amplifiers.  At the present time, FPI does not  provide products in this FSC code.  The AM amplifier that will be produced by FPI is the same as the item previously produced, with slight modifications to replace obsolete parts.  Therefore, it is not different in function from the previous amplifier classified in FSC 5895.  For these reasons, FPI believes the AM amplifier classified in FSC 5996, does not meet the definition of “new product” set forth by FPI’s expansion guidelines.    

	Under the terms of FPI’s expansion guidelines, interested parities may submit comments regarding the production of this item by FPI.  In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply: 1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice; 2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why the item should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI; 3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact that such a production decision may also be considered relevant.  All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by the FPI Board of Directors.  All commenters will be advised whether FPI decides to initiate the public involvement guidelines process.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question with FPI’s Board of Directors.

<SUBJECT>59 -- FPI Production in FSC Code 5995
<DESC>This notice announces the decision regarding FPI’s production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Code - 5995 - Cable, Cord, and Wire Assemblies: Communications Equipment.  FPI’s new product/significant expansion guidelines were published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register.  A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product’s expansion threshold in cases of a public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.  		

As a result of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, DoD has placed orders for electronics products far in excess of their usual requirements.  In the past two fiscal years, FPI requested and obtained from the Board of Directors (BOD) permission to invoke the national exigency provision in the guidelines for electronic products under FSC codes 6220, 6135, and 5965.  This originated at the request of DoD.  As was the case with those products, DoD has experienced a sharp increase in the need for cable, cord and wire assemblies, listed under FSC code 5995.  

The FY 2004 sales ceiling for FSC code 5995 is $45.5 million.  However, if DoD continues to place orders at the current rate for products under this FSC code, FPI sales may exceed $58 million by the end of FY 2004.  In light of the military’s critical on-going need, FPI’s BOD approved the request to invoke the national exigency provisions of the guidelines.  FPI’s sales of cable, cord and wire assemblies under FSC code 5995, will not constitute a guidelines violation  based on the national exigency provision of the FPI’s rules.  

It should be noted that the national exigency provision of the FPI’s guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military operations.  At the minimum, however, it is expected that the increased production levels as a result of ongoing military war efforts and the continuing war on terrorism, will continue through the balance of the current fiscal year and into FY 2005.  

Interested parties have a right to raise questions with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: RACS Branch.

<SUBJECT>73 -- FPI Production of Plastic Tableware
<DESC>In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors’ directive to seek and pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily(CBD) regarding FPI’s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18.U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI’s intentions to produce tableware which would include, plastic flatware, plates, trays, etc. for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompasses all plastic flatware/dinnerware classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7340 - Cutlery and Flatware, as well as, the items classified in FSC code 7350 - Tableware.  

Once a product is sold competitively, by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI’s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI’s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>62 -- FPI Production of Lightbars
<DESC>“Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, published March 12, 1997 in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997 in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following “good faith announcement” for public notice and comment.

FPI has manufactured and sold to the Federal government vehicular lighting under Federal Supply Classification Code 6220, Electric Vehicular Lights and Fixtures.  FPI last recorded sales in this FSC code in FY 2000 with the production of components for Remote Area Lighting System (RALS)at Lompoc.  FSC code 6220 is listed in FPI’s “Schedule of Products”.  An item’s FSC code is the primary determinant of what constitutes a “specific product” as defined by FPI’s expansion guidelines.  Before initiating production of a new “specific product,” FPI must obtain approval from its Board of Directors.  It is FPI’s belief that light bars, classified under FSC code 6220, are similar to the components for RALS which FPI produced at Lompoc, also classified under FSC code 6220.  For this reason, FPI believes that light bars in FSC 6220 do not meet the definition of "new product" as set forth by FPI's expansion guidelines. 

FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe light bars (FSC 6220) to be a product separate and distinct from any other item supplied by FPI.  Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI.  In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply: 1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice; 2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why the items should be considered new products, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI; 3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the items should be defined as new products, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.  All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by the FPI Board of Directors.  All commenters will be advised whether FPI decides to initiate the public involvement guidelines process.

Any interested party has a right to raise any question with FPI's Board of Directors.  All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C.  20534.

FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.

This notice announces FPI’s intentions to produce Humvee Door Kits and Vehicle UpArmor on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompass Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 2541 - Weapons Systems Specific Vehicular Accessories; which includes accessory kits and individual components used in the repair and/or modification of weapon system type vehicles such as tanks, personnel carriers, mobile howitzers,etc.

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI’s Schedule of Product as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point for these products, nor will it seek approval from its Board of Directors to expand production of these products by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.

<SUBJECT>25 -- FPI Production in FSC Code 2590
<DESC>“Under the provisions of FPI's guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997, in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following "good faith" announcement for public notice and comment.  FPI proposes to manufacture High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HUMMWV) spare tire carriers.

Under FPI’s guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a “specific product” is an item’s Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  The HUMMWV spare tire carrier is classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 2590, Miscellaneous Vehicular Components.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1997.

Under FPI’s guidelines, the secondary determinant of what constitutes a “specific product” is an item’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code (or the current NAICS code).  The most appropriate SIC and NAICS codes for HUMMWV spare tire carriers are:  SIC 3714, Motor Vehicle Parts and Accessories, and NAICS code 336399, All Other Motor Vehicle Parts Manufacturing.  FPI does not make items in SIC 3714, but does make items in NAICS code 336399. 

FPI has a history of making items in both the FSC code and NAICS code for HUMMWV spare tire carriers.  For this reason, FPI believes HUMMWV spare tire carriers do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines. However, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI. In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply:

1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice;
2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why the HUMMWV spare tire carrier should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI;
3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.

All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by the FPI Board of Directors.  All commenters will be advised when FPI makes a final determination.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question with FPI's Board of Directors.  

All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.”

Background***

Within the context of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA); the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21); the likely forthcoming re-authorization for surface transportation; and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), transportation planning agencies at all levels of government have to meet the complex demands of identifying and responding to multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making. ************ 

FHWA wants to assist the transportation community in using the transportation planning process to meet these needs.  Agencies need to do more with less.  Because the demands on transportation planning continue to grow, many state, metropolitan and local transportation planning agencies are seeking innovative application-oriented research and evaluation of planning approaches.  These agencies, their staff and other key stakeholders in the transportation planning process are the audience for this research.  To realize this research, FHWA is seeking the support and cooperation of multi-disciplined research partners to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.  The ability to bring in specialists in various fields, including those outside traditional transportation disciplines, is of greater significance today than at any other time. The ability to retain flexible and responsive support, available at any time to research, assist, and answer the questions related to planning for a world class transportation system is of utmost importance.****************** 

Purpose***

The purpose of this solicitation is to develop innovative approaches for improving transportation planning and decision-making.  This may include new or improved planning applications; expanding planning applications to new audiences; and identification and testing new channels for disseminating information and expertise.**************************

Transportation Planning Research Topic Areas****

The research will target specific needs and areas of interest that will support FHWA work in Transportation Planning Capacity Building.  Each proposal should address one or the other topic area but not both.  If an offeror wishes to address both topic areas, then they should submit two separate and complete proposals that will be evaluated separately.***************

Transportation Planning in Rural Areas and Small Communities*** 

Summary of Topic Area: With constant changes in the field of transportation planning, it is increasingly important to ensure that transportation professionals and decision-makers located in the rural areas and small communities have access to tools and techniques developed for their unique needs and capacities.  There are over 2,000 non-metropolitan Counties and hundreds of regional development districts outside of metropolitan areas in the United States.  The transportation professionals and decision-makers frequently work in small and remote agencies so have less day-to-day contact with their peers to master the latest planning tools and techniques.  They may not have the time, budget or staff to attend training or workshops on innovative planning tools.  At the same time, a single transportation project in these areas may have considerable and long-lasting implications on the economic and social well being of the area.  Accordingly, it is important that the professionals and decision-makers have the best available information about transportation needs and options so they can participate in the Statewide transportation planning process.******************

This past year, all States adopted a separate and discrete consultation process for involving non-metropolitan local officials in the transportation planning process.  While some States have had a process for some time, many States more recently adopted processes to meet the new rule.  Accordingly, many States DOTs and organizations representing local officials are looking for evaluation of consultation practices and success stories***********************

Past research in this planning research focus area has included applying readily available data and analysis tools for understanding transportation needs, review of inter-governmental processes and identification of centers of support for rural and small community planning.***************

Intermodal Planning in Statewide and Metropolitan Processes***

Summary of topic area: A key component of successful transportation systems is interaction between and among modes.  To do this agencies that are responsible for the development or management of parts of the system need both technical tools and organizational approaches for cooperation within a metropolitan area or state in order to develop and engage in multi-partner processes.*********************

Statement of Work: 
I. OBJECTIVE. 

As a result of the August 14th blackout the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is investigating issues that might contribute to enhancing the effective and efficient operation of the bulk power transmission grid.  The blackout investigation has found operator performance as one of the root causes of the August 14, 2003 disturbance, with deficiencies including lack of situational awareness, failure of personnel to declare an emergency and failure to take appropriate action to insure that the bulk electric system remained in a secure and reliable state.

The safe and reliable operation of the bulk electric power system in North America requires well-trained and effective personnel.  Historically, many utilities have used seniority as a primary determinant in the selection of power system operators, and relied upon on-the-job training to fill in the gaps in an individual’s experience.  As the grid has becomes heavily used, there is a need to identify and train for the basic skill set that an individual must possess in order to be considered for operating the power system.  

The FERC is seeking a highly qualified contractor to perform the services described in Section II.  The contractor shall prepare and submit to the FERC a comprehensive study addressing training, certification, licensing, and current practices for power system operators.  It is intended that this study will include identification of best practices for qualification of power system operators, identification of best practices for operator training in the electricity industry as well identification of training practices in other industries with requirements that are applicable to power system operator training. The study will include a gap analysis of any critical factors missing in today’s training programs and recommend minimum requirements for an operator training program.

II. SCOPE OF WORK. 

Specifically, FERC is interested in addressing all key operator training (and certification) issues raised within the interim and final blackout reports:
1.	Determine the breadth of current training practices across the bulk power system that is provided to system operators:
a.	Identify best-in-class training programs including areas such as re-certification, simulator training, required hours of training, emergency and normal operations training.  Consideration of U.S. and Canadian entities should be included.  Identify key areas, educational methods and training and certification approaches that are available.  Also highlight unsatisfactory training programs and document the characteristics that result in inadequate training. Consideration should be taken for the various control operations within the bulk power transmission system including Independent system operators, control area and Transmission operators, Regional reliability coordinators, etc.
b.	Identify potential obstacles that may prevent organizations from implementing and improving their training program, or hinder putting into practice procedures that are likely to enhance reliability.
c.	Identify minimum staffing levels to allow for adequate ongoing operator training and identify the amount of time being offered to operators across the system.  
2.	Identify best practices from other industries that could be implemented to better prepare power system operators.
a.	Consider training programs for operators in highly complex, high pressure industries such as military, air traffic system control, commercial and military aviation, and nuclear plants (NRC).
b.	Outline training and education materials and methods that are available including training metrics, types of training, content of training programs, required hours, refresher courses, minimum training requirements, training levels and certification grades, and re-certification processes.  
c.	Identify pertinent parallels to power system operations and identify training gaps and opportunities for improved training in the bulk power sector.  
3.	Develop characteristics of an effective power systems operator training and performance improvement program. 
a.	Identify functions within the bulk power system that would require training and certification programs. Functional areas requiring training and certification based on the NERC functional model would likely include – reliability authority, interchange authority, balancing authority, generator operator, transmission operator and market operator.   As part of the current training assessment, information should be collected pertaining to job tasks from existing data.
i.	Determine the needs of a power system operator – i.e. skills, attributes and knowledge that power system operators need and if appropriate define differences and similarities for training and certification requirements among functional areas.   
ii.	Determine minimum training requirements - including the appropriate amount of time for an operator to commit to ongoing training, certification and re-certification. 
b.	Recommend methods of conducting various types of training, e.g. seminars, computer based, on the job etc., based on tasks and responsibilities. This includes training programs for operations management, including their role during emergencies and should address incorporating lessons learned during real-time operation into training/ certification programs.
c.	Recommend the appropriateness of establishing grades or levels of operator qualifications from entry level to supervisor based on education, training and experience.   If levels of certification are deemed necessary, recommend criteria for each level.  
d.	Develop potential industry standards for acceptable power systems operator training.  The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC)’s training program and the NERC readiness audits should be used as references.
e.	Recommend improvements and performance metrics for the NERC certification program and existing operator training programs.  This includes addressing operator and supervisor authorities and defining responsibilities and actions during non-routine events.
4.	Consider the merits for establishing two levels of certification including advantages and disadvantages of either a two-tier or one-tier process.  Consideration for the following two approaches should include:
a.	Generic level: tasks and responsibilities that are common across all interconnections would have a certification process.  Recommend requirements needed to understand the bulk interconnected system and how each system interacts with its neighbors.
b.	Regional level: Individual organizations would certify based on their own needs.  Determine what is needed for operators to competently perform local tasks and what organizational level might be appropriate to administer a second level certification examination process: i.e., Region, RTO/ISO/other organization.
Note:  The study recommendations must consider the requirements of industry standards for personnel training, continuing education, testing, and certification established by organizations such as:
i.	The International Association for Continuing Education and Training
ii.	American National Standards Institute
iii.	National Organization for Competency Assurance

Review Panel - A Review Panel may be established to provide direction and input into the analysis.  Additional responsibilities of the Review Panel may include participation in the kick-off meeting, provide comments on state of training in related industry; review and comment on draft reports and final deliverables; and assist in the implementation of recommendations from the final report. 

III. DELIVERABLES. Based upon the analyses, the contractor shall submit a comprehensive report to the FERC detailing items in Section II and setting forth recommendations and conclusions for operator training in the power system. All requested topics shall be discussed in the report, which shall be considered confidential until released by the FERC.  The contractor shall also complete and provide to the FERC staff an electronic copy of the report in Microsoft Word 2002 format.  Deliverables shall include a contract kick-off meeting with the FERC, a draft report, a briefing to FERC staff and review panel on the draft report, and a final report.  Throughout the study period, the contractor shall provide immediate notification to FERC staff of significant findings and important revelations.  The contractor will also be responsible for conducting weekly briefings with the FERC staff regarding the progress of the analysis.  Finally, the contractor will be available as an expert witness on behalf of the staff of the FERC in any hearings or meetings on applications.

IV. SCHEDULE. The offeror shall submit a schedule of deliverables including intermediate milestone dates.  The draft report shall be submitted to the FERC staff no later than March 1, 2005.  The report will be finalized with responses to FERC staff comments by March 31, 2005.  

If the vendor is unable to adequately perform all tasks, teaming arrangements are encouraged. All offerors and subcontractors will complete and submit with their proposals, the Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) representation or the OCI disclosure and the OCI Questionnaire. Also include with offer, a completed copy of Provision at FAR 52.212.3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (MAY 2004).

<DESC>Purpose
The House of Representatives is interested in acquiring the services of a contractor to provide vendor-neutral requirements analysis in the development of detailed documents necessary for a solicitation for the implementation of House "live streaming" or "webcasting" services from each of the 19 committee hearing rooms." 

The successful offeror shall provide comprehensive services and staff to encompass all aspects of the project.  

Background

The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) is one of three officers of the U.S. House of Representatives along with the Office of the Clerk and the Sergeant at Arms.  The officers, together with the Architect of the Capitol and other House offices, jointly provide a foundation of services to facilitate the work activities of the House, its Members, and staff.  
The current CAO organization consists of an immediate office and five divisions:  Finance, House Information Resources (HIR), Human Resources (HR), Office of Procurement (OP), and House Support Services (HSS).  

As part of the HSS organization, the House Recording Studio (HRS) is the central location where all audio and video feeds from committee hearing rooms are received and broadcast on the House Cable TV System.  In addition, HRS provides:
	
	- A House Recording Studio facility to record video and audio programs for distribution to their constituents, and

	- A Closed Captioned National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) broadcast quality signal of House floor proceedings
	to House community offices via an internal cable TV system and to external consumers through media hubs using the
	House Floor Coverage (HFC) facility.

The House Recording Studio facility began operations in 1956 and began capturing audio and video signals to broadcast on the 
House Cable TV System in 2001.  At this time, each committee is responsible for contracting webcasting services independently.
It is the desire of the House to uniformly perform all webcasting services.

The service shall comply with all applicable provisions of the standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) (http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/) to ensure the accessible use of Federal electronic and information technology. See also C.2.0. C.3.2 Required Service Features. The service shall capture frequently asked investor questions and their answers and make them available to the public in a user-friendly format. Additionally, the service shall serve as a research tool for the questions of SEC personnel.

The service shall provide satisfactory answers often enough to ensure that the number of Question Form referrals received by the SEC does not increase. C.3.3.2 The service shall use an open (nonproprietary) question and answer database that the public can access through external Internet search engines such as Google or Yahoo.

Option year two, if exercised, shall be from date of option exercise through one year. Award is anticipated in July 2004. The Government intends to issue a purchase order for the above items to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability, (2) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (3) price. If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). This evaluation shall be based on information provided by the contractor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item FAR clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation.

<DESC>Amendment three to RFQ CJG1001.  Questions and Answers.

Question: Who is the current contractor?  Is the current contractor eligible to respond to this proposal?  Do you know if they are planning to do so?

Answer:  The current contractors are William Sowers and Jim Lipari.  They are  eligible to respond to this solicitation.  As far as We know they are going to respond.

Question: Would the department consider utilizing a state-of-the-art "paperless" call center service agency for processing calls to your workplace help line?
 NTS Marketing is small business listed on the GSA FSS schedule under contract #GS-23F-0166N. The services you seek are so very similar to what we have been providing in the commercial marketplace for 14 years. Would you entertain such an approach?

Answer:  
NO.  The Helpline is not for simply logging in calls and forwarding them to our office staff for a response.  The Helpline is manned by a "real" person with the knowledge and experience to immediately answer questions and to provide appropriate information and access to resources.


Question: I intend to submit one proposal with another vendor to the above-cited RFQ.  It is our intention to submit one Technical Proposal.  But we are unsure regarding the Business Proposal.  We do understand that we should submit separate submissions of the Representations and Certifications documents. 
However, we are not sure if it is permissable to submit the balance of the Business Proposal as one.  Please clarify. 

Answer:  Yes, it is permmissable to submit one business proposal.  This proposal will consist of budgets for both parties.  The relationship of the parties needs to be established prior to submitting the proposal.  The relationship may be a prime contractor and a subcontractor or it may be a joint venture or other teaming arrangement.  However, the arrangements need to be identified and company relationships need to be fully disclosed in the offer.  Each company submits its own representations and certifications.


Question:   The following sections of the Representations and Certifications documents do not seem to apply to me, as we are both sole proprietors.  In light of that, please clarify as to which do not apply to our proposal.  If others do not apply that are not listed below, please identify them for us:

FAR 52.222.21, Prohibition of Segretated Facilities
FAR 52.222.22, Previous Contracts and Compliane Reports
FAR 52.222.25, Affirmative Action Compliance
FAR 52.222.26, Equal Opportunity
P.L. 103-27, The Pro-Children Act of 1994 

Answer:  It is not the responsibility of the Contracting Officer to determine which provisions are applicable.  Based on the offeror’s situation, the offeror must determine which representations and certifications are applicable.
 

Question:   Re para 2. Volume II-BUSINESS PROPOSAL.  This paragraph requires "Rates provided shall be fully loaded."  Please clarify the term "fully loaded" for us.  We intend to submit an hourly rate for compensation under our proposal.  So, we are not sure if you want other information regarding our costs.

Answer:  A fully loaded rate includes the salary, fringe benefits, Overhead, G and A, and profit.

Question:  I have a DUNs number.  Does that mean I have registered with CCR?

Answer: No, You need the Duns number to register in the CCR.  You’re NOT automatically registered.  

Question: Is there a dollar amount attached to this solicitation?

This acquisition is being processed as a simplified acquisitions not to exceed $100,000. 
The government cost estimate for these services is not being provided.

Proposal due date is July 7, 2004.

STATEMENT OF WORK


Transportation Inspector General Reporting (TIGR) System Oracle RDBMS, Oracle Forms and Reports Migration Conversion

Introduction

The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Technical Resource Management (OTRM) is responsible for developing, operating, maintaining and updating the Transportation Inspector General Reporting (TIGR) System.  DOT/OIG would like to upgrade the current TIGR client server based system into a web based system, using Oracle RDBMS 9i and Oracle Forms and Reports.  This change is needed to improve performance, capacity, and increasing operational requirements.

Background and Understanding

The system was developed in the 1990’s, the TIGR system and associated software was developed using Oracle RDBMS 7.3.4, Oracle Forms 4.5, and Oracle Reports 2.5.  Since then the system has been upgraded to Oracle RDBMS 8.1.7.4.1, Oracle Forms 6i and Oracle Report 6i. 

There are approximately 30-50 Forms and 200-300 Reports, with associated Oracle database procedures that need to be migrated from the client server environment to a web-based environment. The Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database has approximately 120 tables running on IBM e server under Microsoft NT 4.0. There are approximately 450 users, 40 of which are concurrent. 

This effort addresses the migration of the current Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database to an Oracle 9i Database and the migration of the current client-server Oracle Forms and Reports 6.0 applications to Oracle 9i Forms and Reports. It also addresses the installation of the Oracle 9iAS Application Server and associated hardware and software.

Scope of Work

1.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE THE TIGR ORACLE 8.1.7.4.1 DATABASE TO AN ORACLE 9i DATABASE

Approximately 120 tables exist in the current Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database. The Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database is running on a Microsoft NT 4.0 operating system on IBM server. There are approximately 450 users, 40 of which are concurrent. This task involves migrating this Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database to an Oracle 9i Database. Included with the migration of the database tables themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, etc associated with the Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database. 

2.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE TIGR ORACLE FORMS 6i TO ORACLE FORMS 9i

Approximately 30 to 50 Oracle Forms exist in the current TIGR system in a client-server environment. This task involves migrating the client-server based Oracle Forms 6i objects to web-based Oracle 9i Forms objects using JDeveloper. Included with the migration of the forms themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, etc associated with the Oracle Forms 6i objects.

3.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE TIGR ORACLE REPORTS 6i TO ORACLE REPORTS 9i

Approximately 200 to 300 Oracle Reports exist in the current TIGR system in a client-server environment. This task involves migrating all client-server based Oracle Reports 6i objects to web-based Oracle 9i Reports objects using JDeveloper. Included with the migration of the reports themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, parameters, etc associated with the Oracle Reports 6i client server objects, and upgrading them to a web based environment.



4.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO TEST AND INTEGRATE MIGRATED TIGR SYSTEM INTO A DOT/OIG PORTAL 

Once the TIGR system is migrated to an Oracle 9i Database using Oracle Forms and Reports, the migrated system must be tested for functionality and integrated into a specified DOT OIG Web Portal in order to be used by DOT/OIG employee. This task includes all aspects of testing and integration of the TIGR system to a specified DOT OIG Web Portal, installation of required Oracle 9iAS components, and configuration of required Oracle 9iAS components for Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports. 

5.  PROVIDE END USER AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE ORACLE DATABASE AND THE TIGR SYSTEM 

Once the TIGR system is migrated to an Oracle 9i Database using Oracle Forms and Reports, the migrated system must be fully documented for DOT/OIG End user and Technical Personnel according to NIST standards.


6.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE PLATFORM.

The target hardware platform for the TIGR system will be two IBM AIX 5L servers.  One AIX 5L server will host the Oracle 9i Database and one AIX 5L server will host the Oracle 9i Application Server.  The contractor will install and configure the Oracle 9i software on both servers.  After the TIGR application has been migrated to the new AIX servers the contractor will tune the TIGR application for optimum performance.

Section 508 Compliant.

All screens, forms, and reports for the converted TIGR system must be Section 508 compliant.

DOT/OIG Participation.

All work processes needed to reach the final products will include the participation of DOT/OIG technical staff.

Security Requirements:
Before any work is to begin, the contractor must submit a Standard From 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, to the contracting officer.  The top portion of the form (blocks 1-4) will need to be filled in with full name, date of birth, place of birth, and social security number.  This information will determine if the contractor has a clearance of record.  The remaining blocks will need to be filled in if the contractor does not have an existing clearance.  If the contractor does not have an existing clearance, and the period of performance on the contract is over 90 days, the contractor will be subject to a full background investigation.  If the period of performance is under 90 days, the contractor will be subject to a name and fingerprint check (NACI).
