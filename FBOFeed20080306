This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an ýout-of-the-boxý solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ý	Conducting development efforts ý	Testing developed products ý	Compatibility testing ý	Use case scenario testing ý	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ý	Training ý	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the systemýs current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ý	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ý	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DOýs Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>

The FAA intends to make an award to Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (Horizon Air) for the conduct of flight and data collection activities to support compilation and reporting of the operational benefits from appropriately equipped air carrier aircraft operating in the National Airspace System (NAS).

A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any potential source that has the capacity and technical capabilities to perform this service must provide objective evidence supporting its position.  A written response must be provided which addresses the possession of the necessary resources, demonstrated technical capabilities and experience required to perform in each of the areas outlined above.  Written responses must be received no later than March 13, 2008, 2PM EDT and directed to Joyce Edwards-Williams, Contracting Officer, AJA-47, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC  20591.

<DESC>CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  CWI is seeking qualified businesses with the knowledge, experience and resources to design and fabricate an air beam supported fabric structure. The fabric structure will be used as an environmental enclosure to house a mixed waste exhumation operation beginning in 2008 at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) at the INL. 

The INL is located in southeastern Idaho and occupies 890 mi2 on the northeastern region of the Snake River Plain. RWMC was created in 1952 for the disposal of radioactive waste. Waste was disposed of in pits and trenches. Historically, waste containing radioactive and hazardous substances was managed in accordance with laws and disposal practices current at that time. Present day operations involve exhuming targeted mixed waste, repackaging and shipping to a waste repository.

A large air beam supported fabric structure will be erected on site to protect the exhumation operation from the environment and prevent the spread of hazardous and radioactive contamination. Air handling equipment (provided by others) that will be attached to the outside of the building will maintain a minimum negative pressure differential of 0.1 in of water gage between the building inside and outside, in addition to delivering fresh air at a minimum of 8 complete air changes per hour, and exhausting this air through HEPA filters.  The minimum clear interior dimension required is 80 ft x 140 ft, although larger sizes up to 300 ft x 340 ft in plan are preferred. 

The large building will feature a suspended fabric ceiling to separate the operating space from the dome of the structure and thereby reduce the volume of air that is circulated. The fabric ceiling shall be suspended by a hanger system 25 ft above the ground level and be constructed of lightweight fabric conforming to NFPA 701. The suspended ceiling fabric is not required to form a sealed barrier between the upper and lower areas but shall provide an air flow barrier with nominal leakage.

A 20 ft wide passageway (or tunnel) will also be provided to connect the building to an adjacent building located approximately 25 ft away and must be included in the 8 complete air changes per hour. The passageway will be used to transport equipment and materials into and out of the building under controlled conditions. The passageway will have double rollup fabric door airlock assembly at the north end included in this work scope and a single rollup door at the south end, which is not included in this work scope. The passageway will be connected to a fabric tent structure and centered on a 16 ft wide by 16 ft high door frame.

The building and passageway will be completely portable and shall be anchored and sealed to the earth along the building perimeter The building manufacturer shall provide the design only for the anchoring system.  Soil anchors will not be permitted as a means of building restraint.

The building and passageway structures shall be capable of withstanding a wind speed of 90 mph, peak 3-second gust, Exposure C from any direction, a snow load using a ground snow load of 35 psf, seismic loads in accordance with IBC, and collateral loads of 10 psf with importance factors per IBC, occupancy category IV. The fabric material shall be compliant with NFPA 701. Four personnel airlocks will be provided for emergency and normal egress in the large building. The operational life of the building, passageway, and anchoring system shall be 20 years.

The airhandling equipment will be provided by others and will be designed to be portable skid mounted. Fans and HEPA filters and inlet air dampers will be connected to the building using flexible duct attached to metal framed openings attached to the building fabric. Provide four 4 ft square framed openings per building side. Each framed opening to have a leak tight detachable cover that resists applied building loads if openings are not used as an active opening for moving air.

The building will be installed by others utilizing directions provided by the vendor.  Lighting, fire protection devices and other electrical and electronic devices will be designed by others and mounted on portable stands inside the building. 
This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify and qualify potential sources interested in this project. This announcement is not a solicitation. Small businesses who submit a qualified response will be maintained on a list as sources for a possible future solicitation. It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued by summer 2008.  The respondent must be capable of delivering the building within 60 days of approval to fabricate by CWI.

A full fledged DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS will be required.  If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and is currently accredited by another agency, then that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort upon coordination with SYSW Security.  Contact Mr. Crafton (310) 416-1591, gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil, regarding information/paperwork that will be required.  SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While an accredited SCIF and TS/SCI SSBI cleared personnel are not requirements to participate in the 12 Sep 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified JETSS RFP without having approved personnel and a secure SCIF in which to store information.  

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

Part I ?V Technical Proposal Each offeror shall provide an original and one (1) copy of Product Data Information (descriptive literature) in accordance with the specifications set forth in the solicitation. The technical proposal will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis and shall not be considered as criteria in the best value award decision determination.  Offerors receiving a technical rating of pass will be evaluated in Parts II and III.  Offerors receiving a technical rating of fail will not be considered for award. The following definitions will be used for Pass/Fail. Pass (P):  The descriptive literature shows clearly that the offered product conforms to the requirements of the solicitation. Fail (F):  The descriptive literature fails to assure the Contracting Officer that the offeror understands of has the ability to fully comply with the requirements of the solicitation. Part II ?V Past Performance shall include all data and information required for evaluation as stated in paragraph titled Past Performance Evaluation Standards. Part III ?V Price shall include a completed and signed SF1449, executed copies of the Representations and Certifications as well as any applicable amendment(s). Assessing Proposals:  Past Performance is slightly more important than price. Evaluation Process (PCO Procedures) General.  The PCO will evaluate the proposals in regard to past performance and will perform price analysis in accordance with FAR 13.106-2. Evaluation Criteria Specifics:  The importance of ratings, are set forth below in descending order: i.	Past Performance ii.	Price Part II ?V Past Performance Evaluation Standards Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to successfully meet the requirements of the Request for Quotation.  Past performance will be evaluated in light of relevant contract work performed to a high degree of quality.  Offerors are required to provide past performance experience information for the same or similar rental services as those described in the RFQ.  Offerors shall be required to provide the requested information for not more than three (3) of the firm??s most recently completed Federal Government, State Government, Municipal Government or commercial contracts which have been completed within the past five (5) years from the issuance date of the solicitation identified in this Source Selection Plan.  Offerors may  submit performance data relating to current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of the subject solicitation.  Offerors who pr!  esent similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the applicable contract/ order to the requirements set forth in the solicitation. ??Relevance?? is defined as the similarity of services provided and the dollar value of previous contracts or purchase orders to the items stated in the Government??s request for Quotation.  ??Completed??, for the purposes of past performance evaluation, shall mean the receipt of a DD250, final payment or other evidence of final acceptance by the Government of the services provided by the Contractor. The offerors should provide the following information regarding past performance: a)	Contract or purchase order number(s), b)	Name and phone number of contact at the Federal, State, Local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed. c)	E-mail address (if available) for the point of contact. d)	Dollar value of contact. e)	Detailed description of the service and unit prices. f)	Names of subcontractors, if any, and a description of services provided g)	The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in the performance of the contract, the corrective action taken, and the effectiveness of the corrective action taken. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available, shall receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance may not represent the most advantageous quotation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to acquire information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any source including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephone and/or written inquiry.  This information may include reviewing the Contractors Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), or past performance information from any source whatsoever.  Written inquiries/correspondence and telephone interviews will be posted in the contract file. Although the PCO will seek to engage in an even-handed and fair evaluation process, the PCO is not obligated to engage in ??equal?? comparison of past performance of all offerors.  For example, if two more instances of past performance data are available for one contractor, the PCO is not then required to search for past performance of two additional contracts for every offeror. The PCO will evaluate the offeror??s Past Performance using the following equally important sub-factors: (a) Quality:  the offeror??s demonstrated history of delivering products and services the same as or similar to  the item described in the Request for Quotation, that met or exceeded the requirements of the contract.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: 	(1)  Customer satisfaction, 	(2)  Instances of rework or deficiency reports, (3)  Evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications of benefit to the customer. (b)  Timeliness:  The offeror??s compliance with: 	(1)  Delivery/performance schedules, 	(2)  Timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing (c)  Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror??s demonstrated ability to: 	(1)  Respond to customer concerns, 	(2)  Isolate and resolve problems, 	(3)  Take systemic improvement action. Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider: 	(1)  The number and severity of problems, 	(2)  The effectiveness of the corrective action taken, 	(3)  The overall work record. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror??s performance on a list of contracts but, rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after consideration of all available, relevant and recent information.  Therefore, the adjectival rating generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 	Outstanding (O): Past Performance:  Truly exceptional accomplishment of contract requirements and extraordinary customer satisfaction.  Extremely Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror??s performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ??O?? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Highly Acceptable (HA): Past Performance:  Superior accomplishment of contract requirements and very high customer satisfaction.  Very Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror??s performance record, very little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ??HA?? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Acceptable (A):  Past Performance:  Fully compliant accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror??s performance record, minimal (but perhaps some) doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ??A?? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Marginal (M): Past Performance: Minimal or weak accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  High Performance Risk: based on the offeror

Although the PCO will seek to engage in an even-handed and fair evaluation process, the PCO is not obligated to engage in ?equal? comparison of past performance of all offerors.  For example, if two more instances of past performance data are available for one contractor, the PCO is not then required to search for past performance of two additional contracts for every offeror. The PCO will evaluate the offeror?s Past Performance using the following equally important sub-factors: (a) Quality:  the offeror?s demonstrated history of delivering products and services the same as or similar to  the item described in the Request for Quotation, that met or exceeded the requirements of the contract.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: 	(1)  Customer satisfaction, 	(2)  Instances of rework or deficiency reports, (3)  Evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications of benefit to the customer. (b)  Timeliness:  The offeror?s compliance with: 	(1)  Delivery/performance schedules, 	(2)  Timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing (c)  Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror?s demonstrated ability to: 	(1)  Respond to customer concerns, 	(2)  Isolate and resolve problems, 	(3)  Take systemic improvement action. Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider: 	(1)  The number and severity of problems, 	(2)  The effectiveness of the corrective action taken, 	(3)  The overall work record. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror?s performance on a list of contracts but, rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after consideration of all available, relevant and recent information.  Therefore, the adjectival rating generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 	Outstanding (O): Past Performance:  Truly exceptional accomplishment of contract requirements and extraordinary customer satisfaction.  Extremely Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror?s performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?O? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Highly Acceptable (HA): Past Performance:  Superior accomplishment of contract requirements and very high customer satisfaction.  Very Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror?s performance record, very little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?HA? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Acceptable (A):  Past Performance:  Fully compliant accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  Low Performance Risk: based on the offeror?s performance record, minimal (but perhaps some) doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?A? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Marginal (M): Past Performance: Minimal or weak accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  High Performance Risk: based on the offeror?s performance record, significant doubt exists that the offoeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?M? in the Contractor Performance Assessment reporting System (CPARS.) 	Unacceptable (U): Past Performance: Failure to properly accomplish contract requirements and failure to satisfy customer.  Very High Performance Risk: based on the offeror?s performance record, it appears unlikely that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?U? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) 	Neutral (N): Past Performance:  No relevant past performance history or past performance information is available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to a rating of ?N? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS.) Part III ? Price:  The PCO will evaluate price.  When the quotes are received, the PCO shall review the quotation (Standard Form 1449) and amendment(s) if issued.  Acknowledgement shall be made by signing and dating the original SF 1449, any amendment as well as submission of an executed copy of Representations and Certifications.  Each response to the RFQ shall include a complete quotation, Section B ? ?Supplies or Services and Price/Cost.? Evaluation of Price:  the offeror?s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  the evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 	(1)  Price competition/comparison 	(2)  Completeness 	(3)  Comparison with independent Government estimate The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all items for all contract years (base year plus option years.)  The government intends to award one contract for all items.  Quotations on partial contract line items or subline items will not be evaluated or otherwise considered for award. Determination for Award to Best Value Offeror: Upon completion of this review, award will be made to the contractor, whose quotation, conforming to the Request for Quotation, is considered most advantageous to the Government, considering Past Performance and Price. The Government reserves the right to select a contractor with other than the best past performance record if the pricing of offered is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute a best value.  Conversely, the Government may select a contractor submitting other than the lowest priced quotation if the quality of past performance constitutes the greatest value to the Government and the pricing quotated can be determined fair and reasonable by competition or another approved means.  Pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the Request for Quotation, the PCO shall make any such determination of best value.  The basis for the PCO?s selection will be documented in the Source Selection Decision Memorandum. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029). Service contractor: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract. IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENDOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood the FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number N61331-06-T-5502. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to purchase from Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation !  d/b/a Sperry Marine of 1070 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, VA 22901, on a sole source basis, the following items:  CLIN 0001 ?

CLIN 0002 ? Eight (8) each Two-Node System License (MMS, PSC). CLIN 0003 ? Manuals normally provided with the radars (Bridgemaster E Radar Ancilliary Units and Radar Systems manual, technical manual, and user?s guides) ? Not Separately Priced. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: (1) The U.S. Navy has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of radar systems for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same radars for the non-service life extension program (SLEP) craft as the SLEP craft.  This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the LCAC navigation systems;  (2) Currently, the Bridgemaster E radar system, manufactured by Sperry Marine, has been installed on all completed SLEP LCACs, and has been on installed on some of the non-SLEP (pre LCAC-61) LCACs; (3) This radar system, as previously installed, is integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the NDI replacement gear; (4) Any other radar system would require extensive re-development and testing costs that could not be recovered through competition. It is!   essential that the radars on the non-SLEP LCACs be identical to the SLEP LCAC radar systems to ensure the logistics chain established for the SLEP LCACs can be reused. Sperry Marine, as the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM), is the only known source for this equipment.  Sources interested in qualifying for future requirements may contact Edwin Binczewski at (202) 781-0447and/or email address edwin.binczewski@navy.mil. Delivery will be F.O.B.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  There is currently no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking commercial sources to replace the LeCroy LW420B Dual Channel Arbitrary Waveform Generator as a calibration standard in NAVAIR?s calibration laboratories.  It is anticipated that a multi-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract would be placed with a smaller initial order followed by larger orders for approximately 100 units total.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst will assess overall interest and responses to this request for information in order to determine the potential for a small business set aside.  

Detailed Technical Specifications:

General specifications for the unit are contained in Appendix B of the Operator?s Manual and can be viewed at the LeCroy website at the following address: 

http://www.lecroy.com/tm/library/manuals/LWSeries/OperatorsManual/LW400A-OM2.PDF

The replacement candidate must have the capability to download and output pre-defined arbitrary waveforms without the use of an external controller such as a personal computer.  The LW420B accomplished this task utilizing a 3.5? floppy disk drive.  The replacement candidate should accomplish this task with a USB flash drive or a compact disk drive.

<SUBJECT>66 -- RFI - Night Vision Test Set Calibration Radiometer Sought
<SOLNBR>N68335-08-RFI-0098
<RESPDATE>040508
<ARCHDATE>04202008
<CONTACT>Karin Weinert, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-1177, Fax 732-323-7440, Email karin.weinert@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is currently no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is requesting information regarding hardware that is commercially available and that can be adapted or customized to support the calibration of night vision goggle test sets. The desired device will be radiometer-based and will replace the radiometers currently being used to calibrate the light level output of the Navy?s night vision goggle test sets. The radiometers now being used are approaching the end of their lifetime, and are no longer sufficient to calibrate the test sets to the accuracy desired. It is anticipated that a multi-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract would be placed with a smaller initial order followed by larger orders for approximately 35 units total.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst will assess overall interest and responses to this request for information in order to determine the potential for a small business set aside.

This radiometer is needed to measure the radiance of monochromatic light exiting the ports of two models of night vision goggle test sets. The light irradiating the reticle in the output port is generated by an LED inside the test set at the given wavelength. This radiometer must match the field of view requirements and fit the light emitting apertures of the test sets so that the full radiance measurement angle (FOV) of the radiometer is over-filled.

The radiometer will be calibrated on a regular calibration interval by the Navy Primary Standards Lab (NPSL) at the wavelengths of 690nm and 820nm in radiance mode in the units of Watts per centimeter squared per steradian (W/cm2/sr). This will be done by comparing the radiometer with a NIST calibrated radiometer standard using an integrating sphere source illuminated by the LED model used in the test set. 

There is also a requirement to calibrate the night vision goggle test sets photopically in luminance mode, so the radiometer must also include a removable photopic filter to measure the luminance of the light emitted by the test sets in the units of foot Lamberts. The field of view requirement and the requirement to fit the light emitting apertures of the test set is the same in photopic mode as it is for the radiance mode.

The radiometer must have high sensitivity to perform calibrations at very low radiance and luminance levels.

Due to these custom fitment, optical, sensitivity, and uncertainty requirements, it is likely that a current design will have to be modified so that it is a good match for our specific electrical and optical requirements. 

The Navy is interested in receiving information about what is available that could meet these requirements or a plan to modify existing hardware to meet the custom specifications. A plan for satisfying this RFI might involve taking existing hardware and combining it with commercially available optical and electrical components, or it might involve taking an existing radiometer or detector and developing optics that can mate up to the radiometer so that the combination of components will meet the night vision radiometer requirements.

Detailed Technical Specifications:

1.1	Power requirements

The radiometer standard shall meet the power requirements as indicated in MIL-PRF-28800F, section 3.5.1.12. The radiometer can either use AC voltage at a level of 10A RMS or less or be powered by an included internal or external DC source as specified by MIL-PRF-28800F. 

1.2	Environmental requirements

The radiometer standard shall meet the environmental requirements as indicated in MIL-PRF-28800F for Class 3 equipment with the deviations specified in section 2.2.1.

1.2.1	Temperature and humidity requirements

The radiometer standard shall remain within specified calibration uncertainties at the conditions below:

                Temperature (C)	        Relative Humidity (%)
Operating	20 to 25.5		20 to 70
Non-operating	0 to 40			Not controlled

1.3	Transit case requirements

The equipment shall be fitted with an included hard transit case which has provisions for the stowage of the radiometer and all accessories.

1.4	EMC and safety requirements

The equipment shall conform to ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and safety requirements as indicated in MIL-PRF-28800F.

1.5	Radiance and luminance readout requirements

The radiometer must include either a meter attached to the detector head to read the output of the detector directly or a DC voltage output that can be read with a standard Agilent 34401A DMM or equivalent. 

If a meter is included that displays the output in the units of radiance (W/cm2/sr) or luminance (fL), the meter must have the capability to be calibrated by NPSL on a periodic basis (for example, by including the capability for storing new calibration factors into the meter's EPROM).

1.6	Calibration interval requirements

The radiometer shall have a 95% or greater probability of remaining within tolerance for all requirements at the end of a 12 month period. This corresponds to a coverage factor of k=2.

1.7	Performance requirements

1.7.1	Radiance level requirements

Wavelength = 820nm, High Level: 3.0 x 10-9 W/cm2/sr

Wavelength = 820nm, Low Level: 2.5 x 10-10 W/cm2/sr

Wavelength = 690nm, High Level: 1.0 x 10-9 W/cm2/sr

Wavelength = 690nm, Low Level: 5.0 x 10-11 W/cm2/sr

These 4 power levels (2 power levels at each wavelength) correspond to the nominal radiance level outputs of the light source of the test sets used in the field. Uncertainty specifications listed below must apply to these light levels and wavelengths.


1.7.2	True radiance mode operation

Radiance versus distance error = 0.3% or less while the full radiance measurement angle (FOV) of the radiometer is over-filled

Definition: The critical distance is where the full radiance measurement angle (field of view of the radiometer matches the size of the source seen from the radiometer. The radiometer field of view is over-filled when the distance between the radiometer and the source is at this critical distance or closer.

For a radiance mode radiometer, light sensitivity is independent of the source radiometer distance while the radiometer field of view is over-filled. Experimentally, the reading of the radiance or luminance of a source over a range of distances at which the radiometer field of view is over-filled should be constant. Non-radiance mode operation can lead to large uncertainties in calibration due to the distance dependence of the calibration.

1.7.3	Luminance level requirement 

Luminance = 1 foot-Lambert (fL)

As with the radiance requirements listed above, this value corresponds to the nominal luminance level that will be measured by the radiometer in the field. Uncertainty specifications listed in section 1.7.7 must apply to this light level.

1.7.4	Optics: Dimensional requirements

Radiometer input aperture size must fit the light output apertures of both night vision goggle test sets

The aperture of the light source being measured is 0.950 inches +/- 0.002 inches. To ensure the radiometer fits easily into the test set aperture in a repeatable way (not too tight or too loose), the outer diameter of the radiometer light input aperture must be 0.944 inches so that the radiometer fits solidly yet easily into the output port of the test set light source.

1.7.5	Optics: Field of view, Full Width Half Max = 34.5 degrees (full angle), Out of target blocking for angle greater than or equal to 44 degree (full angle) 1:1000 (0.1%)

The full radiance measurement angle (field of view) of the optics of the radiometer must not be greater than that field of view angle of the output optics of the test sets. Otherwise, the full radiance measurement angle (field of view) of the radiometer will be under-filled which means that the radiometer is viewing a portion of the surroundings of the light source rather than only the light source itself, leading to increased uncertainties. A factor of 1000 out-of-target blocking is needed at a full radiance measurement angle of 44 degrees. 

1.7.6	Optics: Focus fixed at infinity

The focus of the lens of the radiometer must be non-adjustable and fixed at infinity.

1.7.7	Relative expanded uncertainty (k=2): 2.0%

The relative expanded uncertainty (k=2) of the radiometric and photometric measurements made by the radiometer should be no greater than 2.0% once all factors such as source-detector distance dependence, short term stability, long term stability, and non-linearity are taken into account. 

1.7.8	Instability of no greater than 1.0% at all required light levels

An instability of greater than 1.0% leads to increased overall uncertainties. Also, since instability often increases with a radiometer?s age, poor stability of new radiometers suggests poor confidence in the radiometer's long term performance. Stability is calculated in this case by taking the standard deviation of measurements taken over a period of several minutes at a constant light level and dividing the result by the average value.

1.7.9	Radiometer Non-Linearity as low as possible over light level range

Linearity in this case is the change in responsivity at differing light levels. Though non-linearity errors can be mitigated by reporting different responsivities at each light level measured, this can lead to significant errors if the light level measured during use differs from the value measured during calibration.

1.7.10	Immunity to the radiometer being ?blinded? by moderately high light levels

With the current radiometer, exposure to moderate light levels, such as those generated by a flashlight or room lights, makes the radiometer output temporarily unstable. In order to continue measurements, the user must wait 5 to 10 minutes with the radiometer exposed to darkness before the output of the radiometer is stable enough to continue taking measurements. This can lead to potentially large errors if the user inadvertently exposes the radiometer to moderate light levels without realizing it, or does not adequately wait the 5 to 10 minutes before the output stabilizes. Immunity to this "blinding" effect reduces the likelihood of errors during measurement.

1.7.11	Electronics

Decade signal gain selections are needed from 104 V/A to 1010 V/A

Gain switch errors must be less that 0.5 %

The detector must have a shunt resistance of minimum 2 Gigaohms and an active area of 1/3 cm^2 (5.8 mm x 5.8 mm) One example of this type of detector is the Hamamatsu S2592-04 (peaks at 960 nm, 5.8 mm x 5.8 mm detector area, in a TE cooled TO-8 package)

The detector temperature must be stabilized. 

Detector cooling below room temperature is needed only if the shunt resistance at room temperature (or at an elevated stabilized temperature) is less than 2 Gigaohms.

Drift and Noise Equivalent Photocurrent: 3 fA (at 1010 V/A)

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting white papers and full proposals describing innovative technology concepts to provide Low Cost Swimmer Detection and Identification.  Concepts are required that will detect and initially classify a swimmer or diver who has entered a specific zone around an asset to be protected. The environment of interest is primarily expeditionary, focusing on the waters surrounding and approaches to individual Navy ships that are temporarily berthed at ports and anchorages in world wide locations.  The targets include free swimmers, open and closed circuit divers, and divers aided by Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs). Concepts may range from short range sensor technologies suitable for barriers to longer range active systems, but should be novel or clearly competitive in terms of the size, weight, and cost considerations that may be associated with future organic or expeditionary concepts of operation for swimmer detection. The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts in a realistic environment.  The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2008 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2010 or earlier.

<SOLNBR>R1781
<CONTACT>Jill  Asimakopoulos jill.asimakopoulos@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) This announcement constitutes notice to all potential offerors that the Electronic Systems Center, Electronic Systems Group, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Thales Raytheon Systems Company, LLC, (TRS), 1801 Hughes Drive P.O. Box 34055 Fullerton, California 92834-9455 for a Battle Control System-Fixed (BCS-F) Interim Contractor Support (ICS) Contract.  During BCS-F ICS performance, the contractor will provide hardware/software version change and annual proficiency training; maintain technical manuals consistent with the fielded configuration or the changes fielded; provide each of the five (5) U.S. Air Defense Sectors with on-site technical support and local on-call coverage; perform depot level maintenance tasks; maintain appropriate spares levels at ready for installation condition; and maintain configuration control.  TRS is currently the incumbent contractor on BCS-F ICS FA8722-06-C-0001.  Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) and award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The fielded BCS-F system remains proprietary to TRS and without access to the software code and documentation, no one else can successfully perform the anticipated sustainment activities within the required schedule.  The intent of this notice is not to request competitive proposals.  However, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it doesn't restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Please direct any questions concerning this NOCA to the Primary Point of Contact or the Procuring Contracting Officer. Primary Point of Contact: Ms. Jill F.

<CONTACT>Laura Applewhite laura.applewhite@randolph.af.mil
<DESC>The HRC2 Program Management Office (554 ELSG/PNK), 550 C Street West, Suite C-355, Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas 78150, hereby formally announces the intent to award a contracts on a sole source basis to TKC Integration Services, LLC (TKCIS) for the transition of contractor workload and continued sustainment for one month with two option months to allow for completion of the Personnel Service Delivery Transformation - Strategic Partnership source selection. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (for each contract) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).   This requirement is a logical follow on effort and TCKIS is the only source capable of providing the services due to the avoidance of duplication of costs, negative impact to PSDT-SP award schedule, and increased PSDT-SP program risk.  Due to the limited period of performance and the requirement complexity it is not feasible to compete and transition this effort to a new contractor prior to PSDT-SP transition in April 08.  Competing this effort would result in increased risk and increased cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.  Continuation of these services with the preservation of process knowledge of the incumbent contractor workforce is essential to achieve AF/A1's transformational objectives defined in the PSDT-SP Statement Of Objectives (SOO).  To compete these services now during the PSDT-SP source selection would significantly impact the PSDT-SP program.  Currently, services are required for one month only, but two option months are i!  ncluded in case there is a delay in awarding the PSDT-SP contract.  If required, options would only be exercised one month at a time.   The contractor shall provide support to transition existing TKCIS contractor workload associated with applications analysis and documenting requirement specifications in the area of mainframe computers and client/server platforms for the Air Force Personnel Operations Agency.  This is not an IT software or hardware acquisition. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the Contracting Officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For specific questions, please contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. David M. Bailey, Phone 210-565-1272, e-mail: david.m.bailey@randolph.af.mil.  In addition, an ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting th!  e Ombudsman, concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. The ESC Ombudsman is the ESC Chief of Staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/CS, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #: 781-377-5106; Facsimile #: 781-377-4659; E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The USAID Sri Lanka conflict response program will utilize a variety of programmatic tools to respond to the escalating
conflict in the country. The statement of work requires the contractor to implement an integrated strategy, both within the
variety of elements of the SCRP program and in coordination with the USAID mission?s CORE program issued by its economic growth program ? Request for Proposal (RFP). Program coordination should not be viewed as a utopian goal, often discussed but rarely achieved. All relevant material for both solicitations may be found at http://www.usaid.gov/in/
under the ?Working with us? sublink.
The SCR program will support two areas identified by the United States Government?s (USG) Foreign Assistance Framework: (a) Peace and Security and (b) Governing Justly and Democratically. The program under the peace and security objective will address conflict mitigation and reconciliation elements and the Governing Justly and Democratically objective will address the following elements: Rule of Law and Human Rights, Local Government and
Decentralization, Civil Society and Media.
The statement of work has compartmentalized the Foreign Assistance Framework into four activity areas: human rights,
local governance, conflict mitigation and reconciliation and media. The four activity areas will engage with populations
that are most at risk, with a regional emphasis in the North Central and Eastern Provinces. However, many conflict
response strategies in the regions must be complemented with activities with a national focus.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm-fixed purchase order to the Research Triangle Institute, PO Box 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-2194 to acquire services from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to assist the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with updating the condition category (CC) classification system as well as provide technical consultation on the updated CC system required for maintaining CMS outcome measures; and conducting ad hoc analyses. The Quality Measurement and Health Assessment Group (QMHAG) uses the189 clinically relevant CC as the grouper for grouping the risk factors for the mortality risk adjustment models used to calculate the mortality and readmission measures reported on Hospital Compare (HC) as required by the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. Under the DRA - which requires hospitals to submit data for specific quality measures for health conditions common among people with Medicare, and which typically result in hospitalization - CMS implemented the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) initiative. This initiative requires hospitals to continuously submit data regarding quality measures for the mortality and readmission rates for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Heart Failure (HF) patients for all acute care hospitals in the nation to be publicly reported on the HC Web site, located at www.medicare.gov. The goal of this initiative is to equip consumers with quality of care information to make more informed decisions about their health care, while encouraging hospitals and clinicians to improve the quality of inpatient care provided to all patients.  CMS will align its CC maintenance priorities which are required for the risk adjustment methodology used for reporting the outcome measures on HC with the RTI expertise to facilitate an efficient strategy for updating the CC for the mortality risk adjustment models.  CMS is required by statute (Section 4001 of the Balanced Budget Act [BBA] of 1997) to implement and maintain a risk adjustment methodology that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status and other demographic factors. The RTI developed the CC methodology as required by the Balance Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and continued to be intimately involved in CMS's maintenance requirements related to this classification system. QMHAG, the primary CMS resource for the development, implementation, and management of healthcare quality measures and healthcare assessment instruments, also uses the189 clinically relevant CC as the grouper for grouping the risk factors for the mortality risk adjustment models used to calculate the mortality and readmission measures reported on Hospital Compare as required by the DRA. The RTI is the sole organization contracted by CMS to develop and maintain the CC classification system since its development.  The RTI played a leading role in the development of the CC methodology and continues to lend its expertise to CMS in updating and maintaining this classification system as new codes are implemented each year. The process is set up to continuously review and update the classification system as new codes or requirements become known.  To our knowledge, RTI is the only organization that has demonstrated extensive knowledge in this capacity. Continuing to align our processes with RTI expertise in this capacity is of benefit to CMS. For example, selecting a new contractor for this work will be detrimental to CMS since the new contractor will have a steep learning curve. While with RTI, they have many years of experience doing this type of work for the Center for Beneficiary Choice (CBC). In addition, doing this type of work with RTI is advantageous since it requires modification of similar work they've already done for CBC.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System.  CMS program officer shall make the determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise.  The period of performance is for 1 year.  NAICS CODE IS 541690.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to extend the period of performance for contract SRS-02042881 with MACRO International, Inc., located at 11785 Beltsville Drive, Suite 300, Beltsville, MD. 20705-3119 on a non-competitive basis.  Under contract SRS-02042881, contractor support is provided for ?Surveys of Federal Funds and Development and Federal S&E Support to Universities, Colleges and Nonprofit Institutions.?   This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The contract period of performance will be extended from May 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008.  During the period of performance extension, the contract will be modified to: (1) add two new tasks to implement, complete and document calendar year 2008 data collection and reporting activities for two NSF surveys of Federal agencies (the Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and the Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions).  Under the two new tasks, the contractor is expected to continue to collect, tabulate and analyze data on actual agency funding in the just-completed fiscal year 2007 and on estimated agency funding for the in-progress fiscal year 2008 and for the future fiscal year 2009.  All facets of these new tasks shall be accomplished in calendar year 2008;  (2) provide continued support for maintenance of an existing Excel system that provides a method of data display for producing NSF's Science and Engineering State Profiles; and (3) allow NSF sufficient time to prepare for the issuance of a competitive solicitation for a follow-on award.  The contract value will be increased to $4,742,543.  NSF is legislatively required to collect survey statistics. Generally, the survey cycle is initiated by the end of February in order to permit agencies sufficient time to respond to NSF surveys during the spring and early summer.  The data is used in implementing a number of Federal programs (e.g., the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Federal Laboratory Consortium set-aside).  It is also used by policymakers in Congress and Federal agencies.  Therefore, NSF must avoid any further delay in completing data collection.  Interested parties submitting responses to this notice must provide a capability statement demonstrating their capability to perform the requirements stated herein without interruption.  At a minimum, the capability statement   must include: (1) a statement that proposed personnel are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) demonstrate the offeror?s experience and expertise to provide the services described above, within the timeframe required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet the specific requirements described.  The capability statement shall not exceed 5 pages.   Written inquiries and the Capability Statement must be received on or before March 21, 2008 and shall be sent electronically to: jtjohnso@NSF.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing a design for an infiltration<BR>gallery (water intake structure) at Buckland, Alaska. The Contractor, under<BR>this SOW, will provide all drilling and mobilization/demobilization services to<BR>accomplish  the exploration in the area identified for construction of the<BR>infiltration gallery. The exploration will focus on two areas of the Buckland<BR>River immediately in front of the village.<BR>The purpose of this exploration is to drill through the ice in  the river to<BR>determine if there is water below the ice and then to determine the extent of the<BR>thaw bulb below the river channel. At the first location four borings will be<BR>drilled through the ice and to a depth of 30 feet below mudline or until rock or<BR>frozen soil is encountered. It is anticipated that the thickness of the ice and<BR>water will be about five feet or less. One of the borings will be advanced and a<BR>screen (five feet of screen) and pump will be installed and a pump test will b e<BR>performed for a minimum of four hours. It is anticipated that sand will be<BR>required around the screen and that a minimum of two bags of bentonite will<BR>be used as a seal above the screen section. Two additional borings will be<BR>drilled and samp led on shore near this location to a depth of 20 feet. All soil<BR>sampling will be performed with a 2.5-inch inside diameter split-spoon at five<BR>foot intervals down the boring. At the second location the water depth<BR>(including the ice) is believed t o be about 15 feet but there is limited current in<BR>the area. At this location two borings will be drilled and sampled to a depth of<BR>20 feet below mudline or until rock or frozen ground are encountered. At this<BR>location one additional boring to 20 feet will be drilled on shore.

<DESC>As part of its mission, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has a continuing need for the conduct of experiments in support of basic research, applied research, and analyses as related to weapons, munitions, materials, manufacturing processes, and sur vivability/lethality of Army personnel and materiel. It is necessary to obtain a wide variety of technical data on both new concepts and improvements to existing systems.  It is also necessary to efficiently obtain critical technical data in support of eff orts to solve identified problems with fielded systems.   Additionally, data are required to support ARLs mission of advancing and validating predictive capabilities in support of both survivability/lethality analyses and physics-based weapons performance  simulations.  To obtain these data, ARL is required to conduct both traditional standard tests and state-of-the-art non-standard experiments as well as develop new techniques for measuring critical data.  Techniques vary in scale from laboratory microscop y at the molecular dimensions to field experiments on full-up systems.  Experimental programs and support requirements may extend for years in duration or may only last for days or weeks.

<DESC>Description<BR>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command intends to award on a non-competitive basis to Quantum3D Inc., 6330 San Ignacio BLVD, San Jose CA, 95119, a commercial contrac t for the purchase of 40 ea, Part# 1090-35000-05 Thermite TVC 2.0 MDL 3500 computers  This acquisition will be procured in accordance FAR Part13, Subpart 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items). <BR><BR>AATD on a non-competitive basis is procuring  Thermite Computers for use in conjunction with the VUIT-2 System on the Apache 64D. The Thermite, TVC-2.0 Model 3500 computer is a critical component of the Apache VUIT-2 system, and is the only  system that is compatible with the VUIT-2 electronics suite  and currently tested with an air worthiness release for use in the VUIT System on the AH64D aircraft. Quantum3D's compatibility with the existing electronics package makes them the only source capable of providing the computers necessary in time to meet o ur urgent schedule. Procurement of these components on an other than a sole-source basis will jeopardize critical deployment schedules, and further degrade force protection and readiness multiplying already serious risks of personnel casualties and loss or  damage to aviation assets. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334111.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that will be considered.

<DESC>Modification 1 to this announcement is being issued state that a proposal is to be submitted to the attention of Cara Calimano at 6707 Democracy Plaza, Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. All other information within this announcement remains unchanged.
****************************************************************
It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services for NIH?s ?Usability and Accessibility Study of a New User Interface for ClinicalTrails.gov.?
 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 10 weeks from the date of award; not to exceed one year.

PRICING METHOD: Firm should provide a single firm fixed price, not to exceed US$46,325.

TASK DESCRIPTION: ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) is the world?s largest registry of clinical trials, aiming to provide comprehensive clinical trials information to interested parties, including but not limited to patients, medical researchers and healthcare providers. The site currently contains over 47,000 clinical studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, other federal agencies, and private industry from 153 countries. Recent rapid growth of the public?s awareness of ClinicalTrials.gov as well as a number of policies to foster transparency in clinical research has led to the diversification of user groups and corresponding information needs and questions brought to the registry. In order to better serve various user needs, we would like to conduct an evaluation of the usability and accessibility of the ?new? ClinicalTrials.gov site to inform the overall design of the user interface (UI), how well it answers specific users' needs (including accessibility under Section 508), and user experience with the site. The external contractor involved in the project will perform the following set of tasks:

?	Identify potential venues for recruiting participants from various user groups.
?	Conduct participant recruitment and selection of representatives from different user groups targeted. Selection criteria include: profession and prior experience at ClinicalTrials.gov as well as gender, age group, and Web experience.
?	Develop scenarios and tasks for the usability testing for each user group.
?	Identify and/or develop a usability survey instrument, including user satisfaction.
?	Develop a script for the facilitator to use during user testing.
?	Conduct formal usability testing, including both free-form exploration and pre-specified scenarios/tasks (i.e., think-aloud method), to analyze user interactions with the UI. Users will be encouraged to interact with the UI to address information needs not represented in the pre-specified tasks.
?	Use data capture (video, user keystrokes/mouse logging) during each session for post-session analyses of user interactions, both qualitatively (e.g., UI feature use patterns) and quantitatively (e.g., number of mouse clicks).
?	Conduct semi-structured interviews with users to obtain direct feedback on her/his experience, elicit comparisons with the existing UI (for ?experienced participants? only), and seek out additional user needs.


?	Use formal accessibility evaluation tools (e.g., Watchfire?s WebXM) to evaluate compliance with Section 508 guidelines.
?	Use hands-on evaluation by a user(s) familiarity with a range of online assistive technologies to review accessibility from a user-perspective.


1.0	.	Program goals
Program goals relevant to this evaluation are:

a.	Providing access to information about clinical trials through a user-friendly interface, for a variety of user groups (e.g., patients, physicians, researchers), including users with disabilities and specific needs.
b.	Developing search mechanisms to support users in finding clinical studies easily and assessing the relevance of query results rapidly (e.g., potential enrollment), including advanced features for experienced users.
c.	Displaying information about clinical research studies in useful formats that support different user tasks (e.g., understanding the purpose and design of a study, comparing several studies, obtaining contact information).
d.	Providing additional information to facilitate exploration of the registered clinical research studies through query reformulation (e.g., filtering or narrowing the scope by trial location, providing related terms and topics) or selecting to ?browse? studies by topic categories.
The evaluation will provide empirical user data on how well the new interface features work and how to fine-tune or revise them, as needed.

2.0	.	 Recruitment
	Participant recruitment and selection will seek representatives from different user groups. Selection criteria include: professional ?role? (i.e., patient/consumer, healthcare professional, and clinical researcher) and prior experience at ClinicalTrials.gov (i.e., yes/no) as well as gender, age group, and Web experience. In addition to querying a contractor?s in-house database of participants, brief descriptions of the study goals, methodology, anticipated time commitment, and contact information will be posted (physically and/or electronically) at locations appropriate for each user group identified by the contractor, such as:
?	Patient/Consumer: public clinics, Wheaton Library Health Information Center
?	Healthcare Professional: local hospitals (e.g., Suburban) and clinics 
?	Clinical Researchers: academic medical centers (e.g., Georgetown), NIH Clinical Center

Contractor will then proceed to recruit, screen, and select all participants (up to 54 in all) for the study from the user groups outlined above, both with and without ClinicalTrials.gov experience (up to 9 participants from each of the 6 ?role? x ?prior experience? user groups).




3.0	.	Facilities and Equipment
The contractor shall be able to perform usability testing at their own facilities or, if available, at the National Cancer Institute?s User-Centered Informatics Research Laboratory, which is no-charge to Government agencies.  Facilities costs for the usability lab must be included as part of the total cost. The facility selected should be adequate for conducting usability tests such as the one described as part of this Needs Assessment.  The usability tests will be conducted at a usability lab where ClinicalTrials.gov/NLM staff can watch the proceedings, preferably from behind a one-way mirror.  The lab shall accommodate persons with disabilities.  The contractor will videotape usability testing sessions, with permission of the participants, and will supply ClinicalTrials.gov/NLM with copies of the unedited tapes, and all data capture files (e.g., keystroke logs) at the conclusion of the study.

The contractor shall also conduct formal accessibility analysis on the ClinicalTrials.gov site using appropriate tools and submit the results of the evaluation based on Section 508 guidelines.

4.0	.	Analysis
The contractor shall summarize the data, analyze it to determine the most pressing usability and all accessibility problems, and make recommendations for resolving those problems.  The contractor shall also make recommendations for desirable new features based on usability data, self-reported user satisfaction, and direct feedback and observation of study participants.

5.0.	Reports
The contractor shall deliver the following:
1)	A concise Microsoft Word final summary report, including an executive summary, methods, and recommendations.  
2)	A Microsoft Power Point presentation outlining all findings from each user group, including user satisfaction (survey) results.

In addition, the contractor will brief the ClinicalTrials.gov team.

6.0.	Milestones

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project. The acquisition of the specified Stonegate hardware products is necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure.  During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy and IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this new direction, the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industryýs best practices. Technically, the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically, a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements from USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design. Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems, and overall performance.  As this is a Brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO requires the renewal of support and maintenance for Remedy software. The annual renewal of BMC Remedy software maintenance for Overseas Systems Support provides an upgrade path from version 6 to the currently available version 7. This upgrade is free to those customers that have purchased the maintenance and is needed by CA to provide a sufficient number of Remedy server licenses for combining the domestic and overseas help desk in the near future. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line. Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>Support Contract Number: 9809<BR><BR>

<SOLNBR>6376
<RESPDATE>040408
<CONTACT>Sharon Spector, (609) 485-6166
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION This RFI is amended to change the deadline for receipt of responses to April 4, 2008. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Technology Research and Development Branch, Operation of New Large Aircraft (NLA) Research Program, in cooperation with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to evaluate specialized Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles and equipment that are capable of performing multiple tasks at an aircraft incident.  Traditional ground ladders used for accessing aircraft can be dangerous to climb, extremely difficult to secure to the airplane, require multiple firefighters to setup, and do not always reach the desired aircraft exit. Some airports have structural ladder trucks, sky lifts or air stairs, but these vehicles take time to deploy and were not intended for ARFF operations.  The FAA is seeking information on vehicles, methods, or technologies that will provide firefighter access and passenger evacuation into a variety of aircraft, including NLA, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, and perform firefighting operations.  Of particular interest are vehicle which can quickly deploy and be able to accommodate a variety of aircraft exit door orientations, including second-level access.  The FAA may also consider evaluation of evacuation/access vehicles that do not currently have ARFF capabilities (but have potential to be modified to accommodate this type of equipment) for use on the second-level, of a double-deck aircraft.    A technical review will be conducted of all responses.  Responses found to be technically sound may be requested to participate in further evaluation at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida (just outside Panama City).   Responses will be accepted until April 4, 2008.  Both email and U.S. mail submittals will be accepted.  Please send U.S. mail responses to Mr. Keith Bagot, FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, ARFF Research Program, AAR-411, Bldg 296, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey, 08405, or via email to keith.bagot@faa.gov.  Responses should include photographs and information on the vehicle such as application, performance specifications, previous testing/uses, production status, and vehicle cost.   This RFI is for information-gathering purposes only, as provided in the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS).  This is not a solicitation or Screening Information Request (SIR). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Financial reimbursement for use of any equipment will not be provided.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to include the entire language of question 4 and the answer to that question - Question - Please clarify why this solicitation was classified as a brand name only for HP, Dell and IBM?  These manufacturers are clearly among the most prolific in the server and desktop manufacturing field but there are many other vendors, such as Compellent Technologies, that offer superior SAN solutions.  If this brand(s) name only requirement is relaxed, Alliance Micro/Compellent is prepared to provide a SAN solution that will fulfill all of the storage needs for all of the CLINs.  Alliance Micro disputes the statement in the last paragraph of Attachment 2 that states, Providing any other equipment brand configuration will have a definite delay effect on the planned implementation schedule.  As a manufacturer of SANs exclusively, Compellent routinely configures, proposes and deploys such storage systems in a matter of days rather than months.  We believe that there is no justification for excluding other bidders because of this reason. Answer to question 4 - HP, Dell, and IBM all play in the High Availability Cluster space (along with providing Oracle RAC certified configurations).  The example configurations were based off the vendors? provided documentation.

This amendment changes the original response from 12 Sep 07 to 4 Sep 07 to coincide with the submission of the Statement of Capabilities.  Additionally, this amendment removes the NAICS code 541710.

The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) invites interested participants to participate in an Industry Day for the Spiral Development and Sustainment Engineering contract of the Joint Execution and Tasking System for Space (JETSS).  The Industry Day will be held at the Secret/NF level on 12 Sep 07, 10:00 ? 11:00 A.M., at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A8 auditorium, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA.  Each contractor company division will be authorized no more than 3 attendees.  

The contract is expected to have a period of performance of 6 years and begin with a contract transition and spiral development efforts beginning on 1 Sep 08.  It is expected that system sustainment will begin on 1 Dec 08.  System improvements will be accomplished as 18-24 month spiral developments throughout the life of the system.  It is expected that spiral development efforts and sustaining engineering efforts will be approximately equal.

JETSS is in use at JFCC-Space?s Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) as a mission planning and execution monitoring tool of space control assets.  JETSS consists of previously developed software (JAVA software language with WebLogic basis), relational database (Oracle), server (Sun Solaris operating system)-client (Windows) architecture, and commercial-off-the-shelf software applications integrated into a seamless program.  

In order to perform this effort, prime contractors should have extensive knowledge of service oriented architecture/net-centric enterprise services, federated query systems, relational databases, and Information Assurance requirements.  Firms must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret ? SCI/SAP/SAR accredited SCIF(s).  Additionally, firms must have SAP/SAR approved facilities to perform system depot maintenance.  

     If you have interest in being a prime contractor you must submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) not longer than 10 pages describing their qualifications to be the prime contractor as well as explaining their capability to meet the above mentioned knowledge and security clearance requirements.  In addition, the SOC should contain the following information:  technical description of the offeror?s experience and knowledge of Department of Defense military system development and maintenance, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Control systems and operations (specifically JSpOC operations), AFSPC Command and Control (C2) operations/architectures, and JSpOC C2 tool development; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation.  Additionally, include customers and POCs who can be contacted to validate previous work/qualifications identified in the SOC.  The SOC should be submitted to SYAG/CJD, Attn:  Maj Diane Brashear, and SYSW/PK, Attn:  Mr. Jack May, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA  90245-2808, or e-mail to diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil and jack.may@losangeles.af.mil, and received by 9:00 A.M. on 4 Sep 07.  It is the Government?s intent that due to the classified nature of this acquisition that no contractor will be given access to any Request for Proposal (RFP) documents if they cannot demonstrate in their SOC submission that the are capable of performing this effort as a prime contractor.

Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Appropriate small business standards are North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services, with a size of $25 million.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  

To attend Industry Day, please send your RSVP (company name, attendee name and contact number) via email to Maj Brashear, 310-416-1630/diane.brashear@losangeles.af.mil, no later than 12:00 P.M., 6 Sep 07.  In addition, your visit requests should be submitted via JPAS no later than 12:00 P.M., 7 Sep 07.  Send the certification to JPAS SMO Code ?SYS Wing?.  If attendees are unable to send visit requests via JPAS fax them to 310-416-1725, Subj: JETSS Industry Day, Attn: Steve Taylor.

Validated potential primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors will be expected to submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) prior to receiving the RFP.  Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort.  A full fledged DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS will be required.  If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and is currently accredited by another agency, then that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort upon coordination with SYSW Security.  Contact Mr. Crafton (310) 416-1591, gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil, regarding information/paperwork that will be required.  SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While an accredited SCIF and TS/SCI SSBI cleared personnel are not requirements to participate in the 12 Sep 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified JETSS RFP without having approved personnel and a secure SCIF in which to store information.  

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>****This mod is issued to correct the response date from March 2, 2008 to March 24, 2008.  

This concludes Mod 03.****

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies available to protect all H 53E helicopter engines and other flight-critical systems from small arms projectiles with the intention of procuring the material and services on a competitive basis.  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  

It is a market research gathering tool used to determine potential business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  This should not be construed as a promise to contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN 

The H-53E-series helicopter is powered by three T64-series turboshaft engines.  The installed engines are covered by fiberglass cowlings hinged along the upper side.  The cowlings provide an aerodynamic fairing but no ballistic threat protection.  Damage to other flight-critical systems, such as main rotor and tail rotor flight controls and fuel and hydraulic lines, can force the aircraft out of its mission.  The helicopter is subject to hostile small arms fire and other threats when operating in combat areas.  A degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and a ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor areas, as well as the aircraft ramp.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would mitigate the threat of downing an aircraft due to damage to these vital aircraft systems from small arms and similar threats.  
 
DESIRED CAPABILITIES  
The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters.  The Government envisions a mission kit of armor panels or other protective means that could be installed as needed on any aircraft having mounting provisions.  The system would be easily removable at the organizational level for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low-threat/no-threat environment.  There is relevant engineering design experience with a steel plate armor system for the CH-53D helicopter; however, the government has not yet defined a specific set of components to be protected on the H-53E.  The intent of this RFI is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in lightweight armor products that could be applied to meet this requirement.
The government is interested in unclassified written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for protective systems with the capabilities described above.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide a total systems approach for commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified to meet the Navy?s needs.  Respondents should also describe their relevant experience with similar systems and the process they would envision for the development and qualification of a product to meet the stated need.  Please submit all questions to Ronald N. Guy, Jr., Code AIR-2.3.2.1, at email ronald.guy@navy.mil or alternatively at (301) 757-5223.     

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS
The Government envisions a solution for the H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) kits that meets the following operational and program requirements:
1.  Non-Developmental Item.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection should be a non-developmental item to the maximum extent possible.
2.  Qualification.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection must be qualified and demonstrate compliance to the helicopter?s environment.  This includes, but is not limited to compliance with MIL-STD-810F, Change 3 and/or DO-160E environmental conditions for helicopters.  Proof of qualification / compliance in robust dust / sand, fog / rain, snow / ice, exposure to contaminants, and salt environments should be addressed in the response.
3.  Mission Removable.  The H-53E CSA will consist of an A-Kit and B-Kit.  The goal is to have commonality between CH-53E and MH-53E systems. The A kit, also referred to as installation kit, shall consist of permanent or semi-permanent installations / modifications to the aircraft.  It is desirable to have the H-53E CSA installed with little or no permanent aircraft modifications.  It is recognized that a specific A-Kit may be required for each helicopter type/model/series.   The B-Kit, also referred to as the mission removable kit, shall consist of components / assemblies which may be installed or removed as mission requirements dictate.  It is desirable that the CSA Kit would be easily removable for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low threat / no threat environment.  The time to install / remove the B-Kit items will not impact mission availability for the aircraft.  The H-53E CSA must be practical to be retrofitted at a USMC organizational level facility, or by a field modification team / installed at the organizational level.
4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level.  The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.      
5.  H-53E Performance Impact.  It is desired that installation of the H-53E CSA kit will result in limited degradation to existing range, performance / handling, and/or existing mission capabilities of either H-53E platforms. 
6.  Ballistic Protection Characteristics.  The H-53E CSA kit will provide adequate ballistic protection for its threat environment.  Interested parties should provide a summary of the proposed survivability capabilities within the H-53E CSA Kit proposal.  Threat magnitude capability (MIL-PRF-46103 standard or industry equivalent), repeatability and number of hits per a given area should be included as a minimum.  The contractor should address proven demonstration of this capability (through test and qualification data, etc) in their response. 
7.  Ballistic Protection / Coverage Areas and Weight.  The Government has not yet defined a specific set of components and/or areas to be protected on the H-53E platforms by the H-53E CSA Kit.  It is desired that the contractor define proposed coverage areas for the H-53E CSA kit in their response, and applicable weight for the CSA Kit based on their proposed coverage areas.   A desired CSA armor area density envisioned is 6.5 pounds per square feet or less. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT PACKAGE

Documentation should be in bullet format and must address, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience with the military performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, unclassified technical performance capabilities, organization/platform supported, and contract value.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Any resulting contract is anticipated to be a security classification level of Secret.  Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metals restriction of the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a and 2533b) in accordance with DFARS clauses 225.7002 and 252.225-7014 Alt. 1, inclusive of Class Deviations 2008-O0002 (which supersedes 2006-O004 and 2007-O011), unless an exception applies.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Design Build Construction Services for a New Combined Weather Service Office and Upper Air Inflation Shelter Facility at Barrow, Alaska.
<SOLNBR>WC133W-08-RP-0059
<RESPDATE>040308

<DESC>The Central Region Acquisition Division intends to obtain design build (DB) construction services for a new combined Weather Service Office and Upper Air Inflation Shelter facility at Barrow, Alaska. The total budgeted amount both for the design and for the construction of this facility shall not exceed $3.0 million dollars. The NWS Alaska Region requires a new combined WSO and UAIS facility to replace the existing separate WSO and UAIS facilities. The design shall meet arctic construction and climate requirements in Barrow, Alaska. The WSO/UAIS must be operational 365 days a year, even in the most extreme weather conditions, so weather observations can be submitted to the public and the national climate network. The function of the UAIS is to provide a facility to inflate and launch balloons twice a day at 12 hour intervals, 365 days a year. Additional requirements include a life span of 30 years, energy efficiency, low operations and maintenance requirements, low maintenance exterior finish materials and accessibility to public areas in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) shall be evaluated with the goal to attain LEED Silver Certification. The selected contractor shall be responsible to assure that design costs do not exceed the Brooks Act 6% limitation.

The successful offeror shall complete designs and construction, providing all necessary materials and labor to complete the project. The expectation is to award the design-build contract in August 2008. Design will begin in October 2008. Construction will begin with foundation piling installation on/or about January 30, 2009, and construction will be completed by June 30, 2010.

This is a negotiated best value acquisition. The following minimum requirements shall apply to all offers submitted: a.	Schematic Design: Offerors shall submit the required drawings, schedules and schematics outlined in Section L of the Request for Proposals (RFP). b. Project Experience: The offeror shall provide evidence that the construction member of their team has completed one project in an arctic environment, or that the offeror has formed a partnership with a firm with arctic construction experience. c. Bonding capacity for the Project: The offeror shall provide evidence, in the form of a letter from a bonding institution, of the offeror?s ability to obtain bonding in the amount of the offeror?s proposal. The letter from the bonding institution must be in a form that is acceptable to the Government Contracting Officer.

Proposals will be evaluated both for technical merit and for cost effectiveness.  In the evaluation of offers for this acquisition, it has been determined that cost will be considered approximately equal in value to all of the technical factors combined. The specific evaluation criteria to be used in this acquisition are presented here in descending order of importance, except that factors (1) and (2) are equal in importance: (1) Relevant Project Experience; (2) Design Approach; (3) Key Personnel; (4) Schedule/Period of Performance  and (5) Past Performance. Strict conformance with those evaluation criteria is required.  Firms that respond to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to successfully provide both design and construction services.

This acquisition will result in a firm fixed-price contract.  The requirement will be accomplished using 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 236220.  The size standard for Small Business is $31 Million. It is desired that the building be completed by June 30, 2010, approximately six hundred and thirty-six (636) calendar days after issuance of a written Notice to Proceed (NTP). 

All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran owned small business, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Population-based data to answer questions of public health importance regarding biological products. The threat of a swine influenza pandemic in 1976-77 led to a mass vaccination effort in the United States. Unfortunately, the vaccine was subsequently found to cause rare cases of Guillain Barr Syndrome (GBS), a severe paralyzing neurologic condition. For any future large-scale influenza immunization campaign, it is important that the government be well prepared to detect a problem that occurred once before, and the public would expect no less. Although clinical pre-licensure studies may identify potential adverse events associated with a biologic product, rare adverse events associated with the biologic product will likely go unrecognized until there is widespread use of the biologic product in the population. The timely identification of serious rare adverse events is important for at least three reasons. First, the morbidity to the individual may be severe, representing an important safety issue. Second, unwarranted fear of adverse reactions can lead to a lack of confidence in, and inappropriately low use of, the biologic product such as a vaccine. Third, new and timely information that quantifies the incidence of serious vaccine adverse effects, if any, can facilitate benefit-risk analysis of continued use of the biologic product. The objective of this requirement is to development of large rapid systems for monitoring adverse events associated with a biologic product is important, and increasing this capacity currently for existing biologic products can help prepare for a biologic threat such as influenza pandemic that would require mass immunizations. This project would further enhance the ability of FDA to conduct biologic safety and effectiveness among large diverse populations, with respect to severe but uncommon adverse events. This requirements goal is to gain access to data resources that promote the Division Epidemiologys mission to assure the safety and effectiveness of biologic products. This project builds upon and expands on activities undertaken as part of previous FDA collaborative studies for biologic product safety, including evaluating adverse events after influenza vaccination among the elderly using Medicare data. During the course of the contract period of performance, the Contractor shall provide a work plan(s) and a cost estimate(s) for each specific biologic safety study requested. The Contractor will be required to:
1) Analytic datasets and associated documentation (per terms of contract). 
2) Medical record review and abstraction (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Note-not to be delivered to FDA directly). 
3) Physician and/or Patient Survey (necessity to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis). 
4) Work closely with FDA to develop feasibility studies (frequencies to be determined by FDAs identification of a biologic safety and/or effectiveness issue). 
5) Work closely with FDA in the development of a detailed protocol for a formal pharmacoepidemiolgic study.
The contract performance will be in the Washington DC/Maryland area. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract is anticipated, for five(5)years. This is a new requirement. The NAICS Code is 541690, with a small business size standard of $6.5 million. Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.

General Statement of the Purpose of this Contract and Responsibilities of the Contractor:

Colombia faces complex internal and international challenges, is a major recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, and attracts high level political, congressional and public interest.  United States programs support the Colombian Government?s efforts to end the threats to democracy posed by narcotics trafficking and terrorism, strengthen its democratic institutions, promote respect for human rights and the rule of law, intensify counternarcotics efforts, foster socio-economic development and address immediate humanitarian needs.

?	Analyze and comment on recommendations and reports made by the Embassy and through the interagency process. 
?	Assist WHA, INL and Embassy Bogota in resolution of administrative and other problems related to the implementation of United States programs in Colombia, through knowledge of Department and other agency issues and concerns. 

?	Prepare reports to the Congress required by legislation, specifically the quarterly reports on legislatively mandated personnel caps, the Section 694(a) Report on AID and Justice Programs, the Report on U.S. Assistance Programs in Colombia, the Section 599E Certification and others as tasked, which can be from 10-15 reports each year.

?	In coordination with Embassy Bogota, develop and maintain a monitoring system to ensure that Congressionally-mandated limits on U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors are observed and that no U.S. personnel are involved in combat.

?	Provide guidance to the USG "vetting" of Colombian military and police personnel receiving U.S. assistance, including training.  Attend working level interagency meetings to review difficult cases.  Raise problematic issues to senior levels as necessary.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
Plan For Projecting Payroll Costs

	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) seeks information on Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions to provide automated computer software to project payroll costs.  In addition, the Bureau is also soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors to develop and deploy such software.  This is a Request for Information (RFI), to be used for market research purposes only, which is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  This request does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a promise to issue a RFP or RFQ in the future.  This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  ATF reserves the right to accept, reject, or use without obligation or compensation any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.
Part 1.	Background
	The Bureau requires an accurate system to project the payroll expenses as variables change (hiring plan, retirements, pay raises, etc.) throughout a fiscal year.  ATF is interested in replacing the existing software by soliciting information from vendors regarding new payroll forecasting capability.  COTS software that could allow ATF to take advantage of the latest software developments and possibly interface with other ATF systems is preferred. 

Part 2.	Basic Technical Features of a Payroll Projection system
The payroll projection system must:
*	Be compatible with Oracle database 9.2.0.8 or better
*	Be compatible with Business Objects XI R2 reporting software
*	Submit information regarding functionality, existing applications or client installations where the solution is integrated and/or interfaced with CGI's Momentum product
*	Use actual payroll data downloaded from the National Finance Center (NFC) at the end of each pay period (every two weeks) to automatically formulate a projection based on the latest available information and user inserted variables
*	Allow the user to adjust variables that may affect the payroll projection, such as:
o	Hiring plan
o	Attrition
o	Pay raise
o	Benefit rates
o	Different number of compensable days/pay periods in different fiscal years
o	Changes in locality rates

*	Provide any other variables that can be adjusted

*	Have the flexibility to report data using different government accounting structures (i.e. ATF), for example:
o	Full Time Equivalent (FTE) execution by project or organization code
o	Total cost by pay period by fund
o	Total cost by fiscal year

*	Enable users to be able to query the payroll system on all variables to find specific information about payroll costs
*	Provide a standard reporting tool based on the above queries
*	Provide documentation, if granted award, on systems data along with a step-by-step user's manual  
*	Have help and learning functions
*	Be 508 Compliant
*	 ATF foresees no on-site contractor support but may require COTS software modifications


Part 3.	Information Requested
	In responding to this RFI, potentially interested parties are asked to submit information on COTS software that could serve the Bureau's purpose.  If COTS software is not available, potentially interested parties are requested to provide any technical information that will assist ATF in understanding the response to this RFI.  Briefly describe your company, product, services, history, ownership, address how your product will address each of the requirements listed in Part 2 and any other information you deem relevant.  Part 2 requirements are critical in the Bureau's evaluation of any associated products or services.  In particular, describe any projects in which your company has participated that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  Include the relevant information if your services are available on a GSA schedule or other contract vehicle.  Functional demonstrations for market research only are welcome for any proposed solutions.  You will be contacted based on your capability and the response to this RFI if a functional demonstration is required.
Part 4.	General Information
An electronic copy of a response to this RFI is requested.  Respondents to the RFI may be contacted for additional information or clarifications concerning their RFI response if ATF determines it to be necessary. Submit electronic response by April 30, 2008, 5PM Eastern Standard Time to brian.wilkins@atf.gov.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Tenant Relocation Move Services

Introduction:

The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS)may procure the services of multiple professional moving service contractors to provide logistical services.  These services would encompass continued logistical services in support of the Pentagon Renovation Project. The services primarily involve relocating furniture and other office equipment within the Pentagon per schedules to be developed after award. In addition, these services could be used on a WHS Enterprise-wide basis to support of relocations of DoD components from leased space in the National Capitol Region (NCR) to Fort Belvoir, VA or other preferred site alternatives in the NCR and as mandated by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act and/or other WHS operational requirements.  Moves would occur both within the Pentagon itself and from and to other DoD locations. 

The solicitation would result in a multiple award IDIQ with a maximum potential ceiling of $15 million.  Individual task orders will be competed amongst the resultant contracts.  

The selected contractors must have extensive experience in providing the resource management, labor, transportation, materials, equipment, expertise and the performance excellence necessary to relocate the Department of Defense Staff as required by the Pentagon Renovation Project schedule and other WHS operational and logistical schedules.  

Background:

The Pentagon Renovation Project encompasses a complete internal renovation of the entire Pentagon facility including the logistical support and activities required to ready the space for construction and the final tenant moves required when the renovated spaces become fully operational. As of March 1, 2008 there remains approximately 1.4 million square feet and 11,000 staff positions, which will be impacted by future renovation activities. In addition to relocations within the Pentagon, WHS Enterprise-wide related activities may encompass the relocation of approximately 6,200 personnel from leased or government-owned locations in the National Capitol Region including the Pentagon to other leased and/or government-owned locations within the National Capitol Region. 

Purpose of Request for Information (RFI):

WHS may compete this requirement on an unrestricted basis.  Consequently, the purpose of this RFI is to gather information to assist WHS in identifying qualified small businesses that are able to meet our requirements.  WHS will in turn use this information to determine whether this acquisition is fit for a small business set aside.  

Description of Information Requested:

All interested vendors are invited to submit a 2 page capability statement and contact information.  The
capability statement should discuss the vendors ability to handle internal (within the Pentagon) and external (within the NCR) moves of between 30 and 110 personnel in a day including classified materials and some specialized equipment. The moves generally occur on a daily basis (potentially Monday through Saturday) at a rate of 250-300  personnel  a week.  This, in turn, will occur during a two to four month period of intense activity; i.e., moves every day of every week followed by a lull in activity of 6-10 months. Many of the moves will be internal to the Pentagon but, because of construction activities, may often involve lengthy move routes (?pushes?) of between 1320 and 3,960 feet in length.  Similarly, moves out of and into the Pentagon itself as well as surplus activities, because they involve moving furniture and equipment in to or out of the Pentagon through the RDF may require even more lengthy move routes since the distance from the RDF itself to the top of the RDF connector is 1380 feet.  Also note that the ramp from the RDF is on an uphill incline. Offerors must plan for security-related delays such as the requirement to badge all workers and inspect vehicles that enter and leave the Pentagon or other secure facilities. Although offerors will not need a facility clearance, employees will haveto undergo a NCIC check in order to secure a badge. 


Disclaimer:

This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form any binding contracts.  Additionally, respondents should be aware that they will not be notified of any results of the review.

How to Respond:

Any vendor who can provide the services above should send his capability statement to: Keanna Maxwell at (703-693-8384)keanna.maxwell@whs.mil By COB Tuesday, March 11, 2008.

<DESC>The Office of Aviation Analysis, within the Office of the Secretary, U. S. Department of Transportation (Department), 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, D.C. 20590 . 

Response Date: April 18, 2008

This is a Sources Sought Notice for written information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract at this time on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offers in providing the information requested herein. 

The Department of Transportation (Department) is addressing various deficiencies in its aviation traffic data and to align the collection of aviation traffic data received from airlines with current airline industry systems and practices.

The Department requests scope definitions and the requirements definition phase of a project to implement a new information system to process the Department's aviation passenger traffic and fare data.

The Department initiated a revision of the rules governing the collection, processing, and dissemination of airline traffic data currently collected pursuant to 14 CFR Parts 241 and 249 by issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on February 17, 2005 in Volume 70, Number 32, Pages 8139-8198.  This document can be found in the Department of Transportation Docket DOT-OST-1998-4043 with an entry date of February 17, 2005 at the website http://www.regulations.gov.

The NPRM proposed that the Department revise in particular the data found in the Origin-Destination Survey of Airline Passenger Traffic (O&D Survey) to collect additional data elements that it currently lacks, and to propose an improved collection methodology with the following goals:

(1)  Collect and store information that policy makers require to discharge their duty to develop and maintain a sound air transportation system in a way that is consistent with commercial developments,
(2)  Align data collection with modern passenger revenue accounting methods in a way that will, to the greatest extent practicable, minimize the data reporting burden on air carriers,
(3)  Collect and disseminate information that enables users to understand and analyze air travel, the purchase of air travel, and the taxes on air travel, from, to, and within the U.S,
(4)  Track and manage information in a manner consistent with the Department's Information Dissemination Quality Guidelines, 
(5)  Integrate data elements to allow seamless association of attribute information between the O&D Survey and the Department's flown segment data collected under the Department's Form-41 T100/T100(f) program and combined with other ancillary data in order to maximize the usefulness and effectiveness of the information,
(6)  Protect the trade secrets of corporations.

The Department is soliciting Sources to provide expertise for the two objectives (listed below) of the proposed contract.  The first objective requires extensive airline industry expertise.  The second objective requires extensive Information Technology expertise.  
(1)  Create a System Scope Document:
The first objective is to reexamine the issues surrounding the features of the Department's aviation data collection rules for which the Department sought comment in the NPRM but that remain without consensus following the comment period of the NPRM.  The objective includes verifying the feasibility of the Department's proposal and examining and verifying the feasibility of the suggested modifications to that proposal made by commenters.  The Department must decide what will be included in the system design, what will be excluded from the system design, and what will be deferred for future development.  The Contractor will use aviation industry knowledge and expertise to identify and document the (1) feasibility, (2) desirability and benefit, and (3) the detriment and cost of each unresolved issue.  Using the identified project goals and the Contractor's knowledge and experience as a guide, the Contractor will recommend a course of action for each issue.  
(2)  Describe the Functions and Features: 
The second objective is to further identify, define, and document the detailed descriptions of the functions and features of an integrated airline traffic data warehouse that integrates itinerary information reported in the O&D Survey and flown segment information reported in the T100 and the T100(f).  The identification, analysis, definition, and description of these functions and features comprise the requirements definition phase of the Aviation Data Modernization project, and the final list of functions and features will be considered the basic requirements of the new system.  The descriptions will be fully developed deliverable-oriented business requirements entered in a widely recognized and available information technology requirements management system.  They will be described in sufficient narrative and technical detail such that non-technical stakeholders can understand the system's capabilities, and information technology system architects can use the system's operating and performance specifications to create a technical system design.

Sources interested in this requirement shall provide capabilities statements with information on technical capabilities to perform the tasks listed above, provide information regarding past performance explaining or demonstrating how similar activities were performed on projects of similar size or scope.  No standard brochures will be considered as sufficient response to this notice. Capabilities statement should include:  Source Name, Contact Information:  Address, Telephone, Facsimile, and Email, Technical description of previous experience performing contracts comparable to these services listed above over the past three years.  The description of prior experience must include for each contract number, dollar value, customer, the name, telephone number, and email address of the customer point of contact and a summary level description of the work performed.    

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, this is not a notice of a solicitation, and does not constitute a Government agreement to contract.  Sources must indicate whether they are a Large Business or Small Business (identify status, if applicable, 8A, Hubzone, Service Disabled Veteran, Woman Owned, etc.) under the above NAICS codes. Questions regarding this notice may be sent in writing only to the Contracting Officer.
 
The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished in response hereto.     The responses (an original and one (1) copy) or electronic media copy on a CD in unzipped format using Microsoft Word are required by 1:00 P.M. on April 18, 2008 to the attention of Carmencita Jones, Contracting Officer, Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), Acquisition Services Division, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., Room W83-485, Washington, DC, 20590. No Phone calls will be accepted. 

In the near future the Department intends to issue a competitive best value solicitation to those Source Sought Sources. The intended contract is to have a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. This competition is planned to be held as a Full and Open Competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15: Contracting by Negotiations.

<ARCHDATE>04302008
<CONTACT>Walt Banko 513-247-4621 walter.banko@va.gov
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs)  are seeking preliminary information from prospective vendors capable of providing, installing, and implementing a non-developmental (off-the-shelf) intensive Care Unit (ICU) clinical information system (CIS).  Vendors responding to the RFI should only address systems with applications that are fully functioning with U.S. clinical environments and capable of meeting the mandatory requirements found in section 1 and section 4 of requirements document/questionnaire accompanying this RFI.  If analytic functions (analyses of data stored in a database) or reports are included in your proposed system, responses to the VHA Analytic RFI must be included with this submission. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine potential sources that would be interested and capable of providing the required capability, ensure early industry involvement in the effort, and gain critical market research information.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery in response to this RFI, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement. This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes only and the Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.  The failure to respond to this request for information will not prohibit offerors from responding to any subsequent solicitations related to this program.  Responses to the RFI will be shared with CIS committees from other VISNs and VA hospitals.  Reasonable efforts will be made to keep responses confidential from other vendors and all non-VA personnel.  However, if vendors wish to ensure confidentiality, the vendors must redact all identifying information in their responses. System Description: The ICU CIS system will include software applications, relevant hardware, interfaces to medical devices, interfaces to VA's VistA CPRS, and interfaces to other systems as may be defined in the final system specification. The ICU CIS will integrate information acquired at the point of care from a variety of medical devices. These include, but are not limited to: physiologic monitors (GE, Philips), ventilators (Maquet, Respironics, and Puritan Bennett), anesthesia machines (Drager, Datex Ohmeda), gas analyzers, infusion pumps (B.Braun, Alaris, and Hospira), intra aortic balloon pumps, and SVO2/CCO monitors. The ICU CIS will need to interface with other information systems including, but not limited to: VA's VistA/CPRS hospital information system (Lab results, user passwords, ADT, VistA Imaging, etc.), data analytic system, and each other (ICU & anesthesia record keeping system (ARK) CISs).  In the event of subsequent solicitation and acquisition of an ICU CIS, the VA will require the following: 1.	The vendor will successfully demonstrate and certify all required interfaces (see Interface requirements) with VistA prior to contract award and initial installation 2.	All database and template modifications must be entered only once and immediately propagated to all other VISN hospitals.  Individual hospital databases and templates will be locked to prevent unapproved modifications. 3.	A site licenses that covers VISN-wide implementations for all applicable locations 4.	An implementation program to be specifically designed for VA  in order to leverage system knowledge and efficiencies 5.	A uniform maintenance program includes all application upgrades and new versions and is available immediately upon program start. 6.	Proposed systems must demonstrate that the complete application is fully functioning in U.S. clinical environments. The MSExcel spreadsheet accompanying this RFI contains a set of system requirements and characteristics that the VA desires in the ICU CIS system.   In addition, specific questions about potential solutions are found throughout the spreadsheet.  NOTE: the National System Requirements in Section 1 and the Interface Requirements found in Section 4 of the spreadsheet are mandatory.  Vendors should only provide a response for systems capable of meeting these requirements. Prospective vendors are asked to review the requirements, characteristics, and specific questions; and comment on their capability of meeting the requirements.  Responders are also encouraged to comment on the realism of the requirements, technical risk associated with the requirement; and suggest alternative specifications where appropriate.   Comments for each item are to be entered directly in the spreadsheet in the column marked "Vendor Response."

You r response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such i nformation.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by t he Army in developing its acquisition strategy and Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications.  Parties responding to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained i n their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>Description: The Government is seeking a low cost, commercial or non-developm ental solution from an experienced system integrator that will lead to the delivery of approximately 1000 mast mounted Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems within 12 months after contract award. The CCTV system will allow a vehicle commander the capabi lity of observing and recording an elevated 360 degree view of the surrounding terrain during conditions of daylight, darkness (all ambient light levels), adverse weather (rain, fog, salt fog, haze, mist and snow) and dirty battlefield conditions (adverse weather, dust and smoke).  This capability will improve situational awareness and assist in detecting and neutralizing sniper and other threats to friendly forces.  The system will be capable of operating while stationary and ideally retracting while movin g at slow speeds and operating in a degraded mode.  The Government also anticipates fielding (training and initial spares) and sustaining these systems through Field Support Representatives (FSRs) in an operational environment OCONUS.  The government is in terested in receiving responses from industry to determine the feasibility of achieving these goals within the time frames specified. <BR><BR>System Configuration:  The CCTV system consists of a uncooled passive thermal imaging system operating nominally i n the 8 to 14 micrometer spectral region. All external optics will have protective covers when not in use. This sensor is mounted on an extendable mast attached to an interior mounted video display, storage and retrieval subsystem. The Government request t hat the system provide the mast a rate of extension/retraction which will not cause functionality complications. The CCTV system also includes a mounting kit for all variants of a HMMWV vehicle, and all cables, mounting brackets, shipping containers and ot her kits necessary to fully integrate and operate the CCTV on a HMMWV.  Other combat vehicles may include, but not limited to Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) and Strykers. The minimum requirements for the system are: Magnification-2-4 times; Field o f View 40 degrees horizontally and 30 degrees vertically (unity magnification); Electronic Pan and Tilt Mode; Slew Rate 35 degrees per second; Sensor Control-Joystick, keyboard; Autofocus; Image Stabilization; Infrared Lens with IR Detector; Environmental Housing; Video Output IAW SMPTE 170M Standard for Composite Analog Video Signal NTSC for Studio Applications: dated 1994; Video Display IAW Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) (Flat Panel Display Measurement Standard); Max 60 watts of power when  operated over the 16 to 32 VDC vehicle input power (through ODCM connector MS-3114E8-33P); 10-20 Foot Mast Electronic Winch Control; and, 10-20 Foot Mast Manua l Winch Backup.<BR><BR>The government cost target is $30,000 per unit.  The government is also interested in the price sensitivity of these features beyond the minimum requirements such as:  Increased magnification; E-Zoom; Increased FOV; Increased mast he ight; Quick Release Mast; and, Environmental Qualification IAW MIL-STD 810F.  The government also seeks information about the level of environmental qualification of the system being described as well as its predicted or actual reliability.<BR><BR>Informat ion submitted must be complete descriptions of existing products that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above.  Industry must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that their system performance will meet the min imum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or any other data to support the state of s ystem development and or production readiness.  Additionally, Industry is to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely impact high rate production in an accelerated environm ent.  Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments.  Industry response should address their projected monthly produ ction capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices. When considering price estimates Industry is requested to address cost associated with all system components, training, delivery, maintena nce and installation. <BR>		<BR>Responses are to be and submitted via email to joseph.brito@us.army.mil by 1600 hours on 4 April 2008.  Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to joseph.brito@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>All material sub mitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified. Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing the approach to produce, manage and meet the produ ction requirements established above and should address the following items:<BR><BR>1.	Corporate capabilities and company profile (i.e., company type, US or non-US ownership), past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and asse ts and workforce statistics.

<SUBJECT>R -- South Sudan Advisor
<DESC>The comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) signed by the government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) in January 2005 ended two decades of civil war. The SPLM Chairman John Garang made an appeal to the Administration and Congress during his June 2005 visit to Washington for support to transform his guerilla forces into a modern military. Among other initiatives, the support outlined in this request for proposal addresses this appeal.

The U.S. Department of State is assisting in the transformation of the SPLA from a largely guerilla force to a regular military operating under the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS), or at an appropriate future juncture, as part of a national army under a government of national unity or its unified successor. As part of this assistance, the U.S. Department of State will support the creation and the development of the training and advisory team(s) in Juba, Southern Sudan to provide training and mentorship to SPLA soldiers and senior officers.

<SUBJECT>R -- Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative Wireless Workshop
<DESC>The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative's (DeVenCI) Critical Information Technology Sector will conduct a workshop on Wireless on April 29, 2008 in Arlington, VA. The workshop will provide selected innovative companies who do not normally conduct business with the Department of Defense with an opportunity to make short presentations to DoD representatives about their technologies and products. DeVenCI is looking for companies who have potential wireless solutions in wireless mission applications, communications interoperability, wireless security, and spectrum management.

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before March 21, 2008. Selected companies will be responsible for travel and all other expenses associated with their participation in this workshop.

<SUBJECT>Geothermal Technologies - Enhanced Geothermal Systems
<DESC>FY08 Geothermal Technologies Program Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) FOA Special Notice (Pre-Announcement) DOE intends to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement to partner with geothermal stakeholders to develop Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) via a pending Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) covering four key topic areas. This integrated FOA will allow DOE to partner with geothermal stakeholders to demonstrate reservoir stimulation techniques at existing geothermal fields; establish an EGS field validation site where DOE and its partners can perform high-risk experiments under actual field conditions; develop new sensors, down-hole tools, and mapping capabilities able to operate at greater depths and higher reservoir temperatures; and provide outreach to the geothermal community to convey the benefits and potential opportunities of EGS technologies. Brief descriptions of these four topic areas include: Reservoir Stimulation for Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) Applications The goal of this topic area seeks projects that demonstrate stimulation techniques that successfully establish inter-well connectivity at viable flow and heat extraction rates for commercial EGS production using techniques such as hydraulic stimulation. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Technologies Validation Site This topic area seeks to establish and operate an Enhanced Geothermal Systems test site which develops and demonstrates EGS technologies in a field setting. It will be available to a variety of geothermal energy stakeholders including operators, equipment manufacturers, and academia to test new ideas, processes, theoretical laboratory assumptions and products in a real-life application. The site will demonstrate the utilization of moderate temperatures (>200ýýC) at shallow depths (<4 km). Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Research and Development This topic area will seek projects that address key aspects of engineered reservoir creation, management, and utilization by developing tools and techniques useful to temperatures up to 300 C and depths as great as 10,000 m. Areas of interest include: zonal isolation; down hole pumps; fracture characterization; image fluid flow; traces and tracer interpretation; high-temperature logging tools and sensors; and stimulation prediction models. These technology improvements are discussed in greater detail in the report, ýýýAn Evaluation of Enhanced Geothermal Systems Technology,ýýý posted on the DOE website:  http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Communications and Outreach This initiative will develop education and outreach activities in partnership with stakeholders. Activities will include:  enhancing communication between DOE and the geothermal industry; building constituencies; and creating strong ties with the geothermal, oil and gas, academia, and allied industries with various governmental agencies.  New and innovative public and/or private outreach mechanisms for information dissemination will be welcomed.

<SUBJECT>A--PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY DOCUMENT FOR  NEW FRONTIERS MISSION
<DESC>NASA GSFC is considering missions to Solar System targets that may be addressed in the upcoming New Frontiers Mission AO and is seeking partners for spacecraft and other major subsystems of potential New Frontiers proposals. The potential GSFC New Frontiers missions are designed to meet the science goals of the New Frontiers program, as currently understood (i.e. NRC Solar System Decadal Survey, NRC NOSSE report).	This includes comet surface sample return, outer and inner planet and small body investigations, Venus investigations, and Lunar surface sample return GSFC mission teams will be submitting proposals to the New Frontiers AO currently scheduled for release in late 2008.  The AO is a two-step process, with the first proposal response being primarily focused on the merit and feasibility of the science objectives of the proposed mission.  The initial submissions will then be down-selected, and the resultant subset of proposals will be funded to perform Phase A concept studies.  During Phase A, proposals will be expanded and refined to detail the entire end-to-end mission life cycle concept, with greater attention to engineering implementation. This partnership opportunity is being issued to select teaming partners to help prepare the GSFC New Frontier candidate mission concepts for the initial proposal submittal; to assist in the Phase A concept studies if the mission is down-selected; and to provide a flight qualified system should the mission be selected for flight. The major flight subsystems or systems GSFC is interested in finding partners for include spacecraft, navigation, landers, balloons, probes and select instrumentation.  If the potential partner also has a mission operations capability that might present a cost-effective option to the project, the potential partner may include the mission operations effort in his or her proposal. Potential proposers to this POD may submit proposals covering any subset of the subsystems or systems noted herein. For the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the initial submission to the New Frontiers AO there will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners.  Funding will be available for Phase A and subsequent phases should the mission be competitively selected for those additional phases. The respondents shall deliver the requested information in a presentation format.  There are two due date schedules. For responders for the Comet or small-body sample return mission in section 2.4, presentation packages must be received by 5:00 p.m. (EST) April 4. For responders targeting all other mission targets in section 2.0, presentation packages must be received by 12:00 p.m (Noon EST) April 21. Please provide 10 copies of the presentation and deliver them to: Michael Amato  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 101 Building 8, Room 315 Greenbelt, MD  20771 Michael.Amato@nasa.gov 301-286-3914 All respondents will have an opportunity to make oral presentations of their proposed capabilities/concepts. All respondents that intend to make presentations must provide written or electronic notice by 5:00 p.m. (EST), April 4 for Comet or small-body sample return missions (sec 2.4), 5:00 p.m. (EST) April 21 for all other missions.  Notice may be by e-mail to Michael Amato at Michael.Amato@nasa.gov or in writing to the above address. Oral presentations will be conducted at GSFC, the week of April 7 for Comet or small-body sample return (sec 2.4) responses and the week of April 28th (TBD) for all other responses.  Presentations will be scheduled in two-hour blocks.  Speakers will have one hour to present and the second hour will be used for questions and answers. This solicitation/synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	An ombudsman has been appointed. See Internet Note ?B?.	The documents for this partnership opportunity will be in Microsoft Office Suite (Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, or PowerPoint 4.0) format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The WWW address, or URL, of the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51.

In support of that mission USSOCOM buys weapons, ammunition and explosives, aircraft components and accessories, ships and small crafts, engines and turbines, program support services, training support and computer maintenance and support. 

Today a Special Operations Forces (SOF) operator is better equipped than ever before because of the strong government-to-industry relationships that will continue to strengthen those relationships.

For years, USSOCOM has been successful in bringing small businesses, large corporations and government agencies together in one place and this event will offer an excellent opportunity for the Government to interface with Industry.  This event will result in interactions with SOF Senior Leadership and Seasoned Operators from the field;  briefings on long range acquisition planning information; forums for industry to exhibit their products, services and technology;  an opportunity to directly market and connect with our internal customers; and schedule one-on-one sessions with Program Executive Office (PEO) personnel. Briefings will be conducted by the USSOCOM Program Executive Officers (PEOs) to provide budget information on future projected and planned acquisition efforts, assisting potential USSOCOM contractors by identifying business opportunities and prepare for upcoming acquisitions. The exhibit halls will be open to all conference attendees; USSOCOM, CENTCOM and MacDill AFB personnel as well. 

Large businesses with federal contracts are continually seeking small business concerns for the following types:  small business, 8(a),  small disadvantaged business,  service-disabled veteran-owned, veteran-owned, women-owned businesses, HUBZones, historically black colleges and universities, and minority serving institutions for subcontracting and Mentor Protege opportunities. The SOFIC offers the opportunity for these entities to connect with quality vendors and subcontractors who can help them seek federal acquisition and contracting business opportunities.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 21 March 2008, 5:00 P.M.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is March 31, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R09-MAD-08 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is a small business set-aside; The NAICS is 325413, business size is 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to procure on a sole source basis reagents for a Roche FLX genome sequencer from Roche Diagnostics Corporation Applied Science, P.O. Box 50414, Indianapolis, IN  46250-0414 under the authority of FAR 6.302 1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements

The Livestock Issues Research Unit has worked with a cooperator and developed a powerful new method for evaluating microbial diversity which utilizes next generation sequencing based upon the Roche FLX genome sequencer.  This equipment is unique to our application and through extensive evaluation we have been unable to find a technology which meets the needs of our development.  This equipment generates 420,000 sequencing reads in under 7 hours.  Each of these reads is an average of 250 bp.  The cost per nucleotide sequenced via out application is less than 2cents per sequence.  The number of reads within 7 hours, the read length, and the cost are the key features of this technology.  We now have the need to purchase reagents that are specific to this equipment and packaged as specific kits.  The formulation of these reagents is a trade secret of Roche Applied Sciences and there are no other vendors from which we can acquire these reagents.  To attempt to fabricate or utilize replacement reagents would invalidate the support agreement and technical support necessary to operate the FLX equipment.

Description of Supplies/Services:

The purchase is for the following reagents from Roche Applied Science:
 
10 individual GS em PCR kit I reagent kits Roche cat #04852290001
19 individual GS em PCR kit II Roche cat#04891384001
11 individual GS LR70 sequencing kits Roche cat#04932315001
11 individual GS Picotiterplate kit  Roche cat#04852427001
1 individual  GS multiplex identifiers 1-6  Roche cat#05144507001
1 individual GS multiplex identifiers 7-12 Roche cat# 05144523001
3 individual GS FLX Paired end adapter sequencing kit Roche cat#04891457001
2 individual GS FLX sequencing Library preparation kit Roche cat#04852265001
5 individual GS LR 25 Sequencing kits Roche cat#05029066001
5 individual GS FLX picotitreplates 25 x 75 kits Roche cat#05029082001

EEOC technical evaluator(s) will rank the quoter (firm) considered to be the most highly qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this RFQ, in order of preference. Award will be made to the highest technically rated quotation(s). Multiple awards may be made. The Government reserves the right to make contract award(s) without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint. The evaluation of the quotes shall be within the sole judgment and discretion of the EEOC. In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. All contact during the evaluation phase shall be through the EEOC Contracting Officer only. Quoters should bear in mind that any quotation that is unrealistic in terms of the technical or schedule commitments may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and scope of the requirements as specified in this RFQ. Contract award(s) will be based on the evaluation factors listed in this RFQ.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project. The acquisition of the specified Stonegate hardware products is necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure. During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy and IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this new direction, the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industryýs best practices. Technically, the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically, a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements from USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design. Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems, and overall performance. As this is a Brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF).  The IBIF purpose, as stated in Congressional Report 110-434 (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:hr434.110.pdf), page 346 is ?to ensure that investments are made to address shortfalls in manufacturing processes and technologies in support of the Department?s long-term and short-term needs.?
Fielding and sustaining superior weapons technology is a cornerstone of United States military strategy. The DOD?s ability to obtain superior, affordable weapons in a timely manner relies on a strong domestic industrial base and access to reliable foreign manufacturing sources. The IBIF is a program directed toward strengthening domestic manufacturing capability and eliminating dependence on unreliable foreign sources. The Defense Logistics Agency is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that support DOD weapon systems programs in the Systems Acquisition and Systems sustainment phases (post Milestone B) of their lifecycle. (See DODI 5000.2 https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document&doc=2.)

The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing technologies supporting the Aviation, Maritime, and Land Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to develop and implement significant manufacturing technology improvements into these supply chains. Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $12 million during Fiscal Year 2008 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost range for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $2,000,000 with a period of performance of up to 24 months.  The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current or future weapon systems. For selectable projects, DLA may consider using existing contracts, if appropriate.   Proposers may recommend such a contracting arrangement but should confirm with the contracting Officer of the existing contract that all existing contract scope, terms, conditions and ceiling requirements are met before proposing such an arrangement.  The government is anticipating the award of cost-plus-fixed, cost sharing or cost contracts.

2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0003-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 18 April 2008 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. DOD MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (MANTECH) PROGRAM INFORMATION

The vision for the MANTECH Program is to enable a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters' needs throughout the defense system life-cycle. The MANTECH Program focuses on the needs of weapon system programs for affordable, low-risk development and production. It provides the crucial link between technology invention and development, and industrial applications. The MANTECH Program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and DoD facilities, e.g., depots and shipyards. The Program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production and sustainment. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs for: the ability to support 6-sigma (low variability) manufacture, and; maturation of process capabilities to acceptable, quantified risk levels; unique production capability; low-cost, high-quality manufacture; efficient factory operations and supplier interaction; decoupling of unit cost from production volume; efficient maintenance/repair processes; and rapid, low-cost spares acquisition. Projects undertaken are beyond the normal risk or interest of industry to pursue in a timely manner. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors and throughout the weapon system life-cycle. The primary benefit to the industrial base comes from the emphasis on transfer of the enhanced technologies from the initial demonstration application to the rest of industry. Investments that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not candidates for MANTECH funding.

The IBIF program is focusing on the Production and Sustainment phases of the Development life cycle. In the production phase, the emphasis is on rapid, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing; efficient factory operations and supplier interactions; and the decoupling of unit cost from production volume. In the support and sustainment phase, the concentration is on efficient repair processes; rapid, low-cost spares and replacement parts acquisition; and efficient maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations. For a complete description of the MANTECH Program see https://www.dodmantech.com.

4. TECHNICAL  AREAS OF INTEREST

The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land and Maritime and the MANTECH technology disciplines: Metals, Composites and Electronics.  (At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies, however, each offeror should clearly have a identified ?primary target? for implementing the proposed technology.  Proposals without a clearly identified target will not be considered for award.)  All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; part count reduction; innovative applications of Lean/6-Sigma; establishing a reliable domestic capability to alleviate dependence on an unreliable foreign source; and implementing dual use (equally capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; etc. Although DLA sees merit in these areas, offerors are free to innovate and are not limited to proposing only these areas. Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved weapon systems manufacturing, significant reduction of lead-times, repair cycle times, reduction of inventory levels, improved quality and lower costs.
 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

To be eligible for award of a contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems under a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules, and a prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.

<SUBJECT>83 -- Weapons covers
<SOLNBR>H92239-08-T-0010
<RESPDATE>031208
<ARCHDATE>03272008
<CONTACT>Amanda Flint, Contracting Officer, Phone 910-432-4905, Fax 910-432-2114, Email flinta@soc.mil
<DESC>This amendment (02) provides responses to questions regarding Solicitation H92239-08-T-0010. 

1.  For textile based DOD contracts it is normal to require first delivery 120 days after award of contract, as this accommodates the lead times for the supplies needed to manufacture the finished items, in this case the weapons covers.  In the case of H92239-08-T-0010, is there any further information available on the required delivery schedule after award of contract?
Please refer to Question 3,  Amendment 1.

2.  We are asking for  the opportunity at least 10 days in advance of the solicitation closing date  to inspect the weapons in their exact intended field use, so that our proposal can offer the government the best value?
As stated in Amendment 1, the intent is procure "off-the-shelf."  As such, a site visit is deemed unnecessary. 

3.  The requirement is listed as Weapons Covers.  Do the covers need to function solely as a cover in the field, or does the cover need to also function as a bag when the weapon is removed from the field?
Covers will function solely as covers and are not required to function as a bag or carrier.

4. Will access to the operational function of the weapons be required while the covers are in place on the weapon?
There is no requirement to access the operational function of the weapons while the covers are in place.

5. Will there be a first article requirement after award of contract but before delivery of the full contract?  If so, how many days after award will the first article be required?
There is no first article requirement.

6. We believe it would be in the government's best interest to extend the closing date by an additional 30 days in order to allow time for an accurate preparation of the "best value" bid, and are asking that the government grant such an extension.  
No extension will be granted as the government expects to receive adequate competition in the response time provided.  

7.  I need line drawings of the part of the equipment to be covered, or line drawings of the equipment itself. 
Please refer to Question 1,  Amendement 1.  No drawings are available.

8.  In regards to the ammendment, Where exactly can these covers be found? Please list exactly as we have been unable to find any readily available as off the shelf items.  We have looked on Google, Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, and GSA.   If these are readily available then they should be easily found on any of these sites.  We are a manufacturer of weapons covers and we can not find patterns or covers for these exact weapons.
The government was able to locate sources via internet search engines, one of many market research techniques.  In fairness to all potential offerors, it would be inappropriate to provide the names of specific manufacturers or sources.   



9.  What portion if not all of the equipment to be covered?
The weapons shall be completely covered as specified in the solicitation, i.e. with or without ammunition can.

10.  I need dimensions of the covers or the weapons.  
Please refer to Question 1,  Amendement 1.  
 
11.  Do you want handles on the covers? 
Please refer to question 3 of this amendment.

12.  Do you want the cover for just the weapon or to include the bipod/tripod/stand? 
The requirement is to cover only the weapon as specified in the solicitation.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625445 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This is a unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 332999.  

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

<DESC>Questions in regard to the solicitation:

Question: The RFQ requirement states that the "Number of simultaneous users would be one (1) simultaneous user for all titles," however, it also requires that "site licenses for all online subscriptions will be required for the entire university with remote access at anytime."  In addition to the statement, "Where online subscriptions are offered one user at one machine version will not be useful to the university. The online subscriptions must allow all users on campus to access the titles and users not on campus." 

Answer: One simultaneous user is one type of institutional license and a site license is a different type.   Different licenses are offered by different companies.   When a company uses a concurrent or simultaneous user model, we want one concurrent user.   Most publishers use the site license model, based on user population. We know that the same company will not offer both licensing models, this was meant to be an either/or 
option.

Questions
1. Will these subscriptions be new or are they renewals?
Answer: They are renewals

2. If they are renewals, do you know whose name they are currently subscribed? 
Answer: Under USUHS LRC

3. Online journals need an e-mail address to complete. Do you know whose e-mail applies to each journal?
Answer:  gjacobs@lrcm.usuhs.mil or gretchen.jacobs.civ@lrcm.usuhs.mil (Please do not contact end-user)

4. In the information section of the bid, the information leads me to believe some of the online accesses may be university wide. There is a significant cost difference in a
single online access and a multi-user access. Do you know if this is applicable?
Answer: Yes, university wide is what we want

5. How do I submit the information?
Answer: Please look within the solicitation all that information is included. You can submit it via email by the close time or by mail, but it has to be post dated by close of the response date which is February 8, 2008.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 002 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR BLUE CHANNEL LENS ASSEMBLY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to address questions raised by vendors and to change THICKNESS outlined in the attached specifications.  The thickness is changed as follows: Surf 1- from 9.505 to 12.420 Surf 2- from 0.050 to 0.050 Surf 3- from 9.643 to 11.680 Surf 4- from 2.000 to 3.000 Surf 5- from 6.972 to 12.000 Surf 6- from 15.000 to 10.000 Surf 7- from 15.000 to 16.7 Surf 8- from 25.300 to 15.000 Surf 9- from 7.000 to 8.300 Surf 10- from 10.000 to 6.034 The following are questions raised by vendors and the answers: Q1) What is the quantity required? A1) Qty 1. Q2) Does NASA supply the lenses or are we responsible for that?  If we are responsible, what is the coating requirement? A2) The vendor supplies the lenses, based on Optimax Corp. testplates ; a AR coating (on the last lens?) over the band 340-550 nm is desired; there is not a specific requirement to meet. Q3) In what environment will this lens be operating?  Are there any temperature concerns, outgassing concerns, shock/vibration etc.? A3) Environment is standard laboratory environment (20 deg C, standard pressure); outgassing, etc. is not a consideration now since this is not a flight design. Q4) Are we required to provide an opto-mechanical design of the system? A4) Yes. Q5) Are there any mounting features that the lens barrel needs to mate to? A5) The barrel does not mount to anything else. Q6) What are the air space and decenter error specifications?  The Excel sheet lists only Vendor defined ?Precision? Level.  Honestly, our Precision level would	me much tighter than almost every other company bidding on this job. A6) ALL tolerances are to be done according to the definition of ?precision? used by a company (i.e. there is no error budget). Q7) The Excel sheet also specifies not to cement any of the optics.  Does this refer to not cementing the 2 doublets in the system?  Or are all of the lenses not to be cemented to the barrel and should only be diameter mounted? A7) It is preferred that the lenses not be cemented; small air gaps can be made according to vendor capabilities. Q8) What are the performance specifications of the assembly?  Is an MTF or interferometric test required? A8) The lens system is designed to compensate for other aberrations in the system, therefore the actual performance of the lens is ~3 waves at a wavelength of 425 nm; Other appropriate wavelengths can be used if desired (within the 340-550 nm band) NASA has chosen not to actually specify a performance requirement (for now), just that all mounting tolerances and thickness controls be ?precision?. Q9) Question is in regard to Lenses 2 and 3 and then Lenses 4 and 5.  These lens pairs have been designed as doublets.  I want to confirm that it is OK to cement the two lenses of each pair together.	Specifically, Surface 4 and Surface 7 would have a transparent bond (Norland 61) to hold the lenses together.	These doublets would then be aligned in the barrel without the use of cement.  Lens prescription was entered into our CAD model and found two issues: Lens #1 can not be manufactured per these requirements.  With a radius of curvature of 50.738 and a thickness of 9.505, the lens would form a knife edge at a semi-diameter less than 30mm.  It does not agree with the drawing provided. The spacing between Lens 3 and Lens 4 is not sufficient.  Based on the sags of each surface and the current air gap, the two lenses will crash into one another. A9) Correct, the drawing got updated but NOT the thickness values.  We are attaching a revised set of numbers for thickness.  This lens is being used as a ?learning? tool in our lab, we will be working on future versions in which the answers to these questions can be better detailed. The due date for receipt of offers is NOT extended. The due date for receipt of all offers is MARCH 13, 2008. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) by 15:00PM ET on MARCH 13, 2008.

A.  Blood work for a lipid profile and glucose screening is part of the physical fitness screening.

Q.  Is there any chance the subject solicitation proposal due date will be extended past March 13?

A.  The Government is unable to offer an extension.

Q.  Also, can you provide any additional direction regarding the direct labor pricing?  For example, is it only acceptable to provide hourly rates per health care provider type, X dollars per hour for a physician?  Alternatively, would it be acceptable to provide a blended hourly rate which takes into account all health care provider types?  Would the Government accept a fee per exam model?

A.  The Government does not intend to restrict the pricing format of offerors in any way.  This acquisition is under FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition Procedures.  As such, the Government requests that offerors use the pricing format normally used for their commercial customers.

Q.  Can you provide a sample list without personal information for us to use with our scheduling tool?

A.  The Government does not have such a list.

Q.  Will/how will this list be provided during the contract? (i.e. email format, fax, a government employee will input this list into our scheduling tool for appointments to be made by us)

A.  The Government does not have a position as to how this must be accomplished.  This particular detail would be worked out upon award of the contract.
