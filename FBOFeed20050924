8. 	AREAS OF CONSIDERATION:	Applicant must be U.S. Citizen

9. 	DIRECT SUPERVISOR: Deputy Mission Director

USAID/Caucasus is responsible for coordinating development assistance programs throughout Georgia and Azerbaijan, which are financed by Freedom Support Act (FSA) funds.  The Mission has been operating since 1992 and functions in a highly politicized work environment.   Similar to other USAID Missions in the former Soviet Union, the Missionís programs are part of the larger FSA assistance program under the general coordination of the State Department Office of Assistance Coordination (EUR/ACE).  In addition to USAID, assistance programs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, Department of Agriculture, Peace Corps, and others.  

USAID/Caucasus staff are responsible for the design, implementation and monitoring of all USAID activities in Georgia and Azerbaijan, with a combined total estimated annual OYB of about $80 million.  Direction for all programs is provided by USAID/Caucasus and support across all areas (program, technical, legal, administrative and financial) is provided to Baku from Tbilisi to supplement its staff.  In both Georgia and Azerbaijan, recent events have signaled a shift in assistance to work more closely with the government (Azerbaijanís program operates under a Presidential Waiver of Section 907). 

The total USG development assistance program to Georgia is about $86 million annually, of which USAID/Caucasus-Georgia directly manages approximately $55.5 million.  The USAID/Caucasus-Georgia Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing four Strategic Objectives (SOs), which directly link with the Europe and Eurasia Bureau goals for economic growth, energy, democratic reform, and community mobilization, health and education (social development).  A cross-cutting Program Support Objective manages the participant training program, a small grants program administered by the Eurasia Foundation, and program support costs (support personnel, office space, evaluations, assessments, TDY support, etc).  

Basic Function of the Position

The incumbent will serve as Program Management and Policy Advisor and Acting Program Officer.  As Acting Program Officer, the Advisor will: provide program management and policy inputs for the design, implementation, and monitoring of activity portfolios associated with the four Mission SOs; and, cover gaps in Mission executive leadership and management capacity due to home leaves, scheduled transfers of senior staff, etc.

The Advisor will provide management, policy, and leadership support to Mission-wide activities, advise on program management, engage in liaison functions, and participate in project development, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.  The Advisor will utilize skill and judgment in interactions with the highest levels of U.S. Embassy management, and with senior Government of Georgia (GoG) counterparts, including the Ministerial and Vice-Minister levels.  As Acting Program Officer, the incumbent requires mastery of program and project design and implementation skills.  Thus, to apply new theories and developments to extremely difficult problems is required.  The assignment will be performed on a TDY, requiring a level of skill which may exceed that of a Program Officer who is constantly ìon the groundî and can continue efforts to apply concepts and theories and programs to resolve Georgiaís complex development challenges, particularly its unyielding problems in unemployment as well as in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Major Duties and Responsibilities:

Serves as an expert advisor and technical authority on complex and, often, precedent-setting policy and program issues, developing policies, strategies, and plans for development assistance programs/projects for Mission-wide application.  Provides specialized expertise to Offices and SO Teams in designing and monitoring policies, strategies, and programs in all functional areas.  Provides strategic leadership in developing, drafting, and implementing the Performance Monitoring Plan, the annual SEED Report, and the Annual Report (formerly the R4).  Advises Mission staff, host-country personnel, and PVO/NGO personnel on new developments, and the most effective approaches to problems of development assistance in the country, and articulates the benefits of interventions to effectively reach specific target audiences, from high-level government and opinion leaders, to technical audiences and community groups.  Provides technical advice, guidance, and support to the Mission, PVOs/NGOs, and the host country on technical issues regarding the design, implementation, management, and evaluation of programs/projects.  Provides written and oral reports to senior Mission management on a variety of subjects, as appropriate and when requested.  

Provides technical and managerial guidance for worldwide research on Mission-specific issues.  Coordinates incorporation of research findings into implementable interventions within the Mission portfolio.  Serves as an advisor and technical authority on policy, program, and implementation planning issues in development assistance.  Provides expert advice and state-of-the-art professional assistance and support to the Mission, PVOs/NGOs, and the host country on incorporating research into programs and strategies.  Provides technical liaison with other USG Agencies, other donor organizations, multilateral banks, PVOs/NGOs, and other organizations to coordinate their efforts with USAID programs, policies, and approaches in Georgia.

Participates in the development of strategies, plans, program guidance, and dissemination of research results for Mission-wide (and regional, where applicable) application, and for incorporation into programs/projects.

Provides assistance, as directed, to SO Teams and their partners in the organization and management of performance reviews and assessments.  Based on findings and recommendations from reviews and assessments, assists SO Teams in developing and/or modifying annual procurement plans, and in adjusting the design of new/ongoing activities, as appropriate.  Over the course of the assignment, the Advisor will organize and conduct at least two internal performance reviews of the activity portfolios for different Mission SOs.  Assists the Program Office in conducting revalidations of the Mission Strategic Plan, in light of new developments and unexpected opportunities.  Assists SO Teams in the design/oversight of sectoral and multi-sectoral assessments, and special topic analyses ñ such as health, private enterprise, competitiveness, rule-of-law, anti-corruption/trafficking, or democratization and local government.   

Maintains knowledge of current literature and research, in order to advise USAID/Georgia to facilitate and coordinate activities in the development assistance area.  Attends conferences and meetings, as required, for the purposes of professional interchange, and establishes and maintains effective working relationships with colleagues and institutions in related fields.

Prepares, or oversees the preparation of, project papers, project agreements, project authorizations, Congressional notifications, and implementation letters.  Participates, as requested, in the review of contractor selection and approval, including preparing related documents such as invitations for bid, and plans and specifications for professional services.  Coordinates, as required, the evaluation of projects during or following project completion, to ascertain project and cost effectiveness, including implications for future programs/projects.

Plays a key role in the development and review of USAID/Georgia strategic plans.  Ensures all phases of project and/or non-project activity are developed to meet technical, legal, financial, statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements.  As needed, assists SO Teams in developing SOWs for sector-level assistance initiatives and interventions, to be implemented through large, competitively let umbrella-type grants and contracts.

Coordinates the development and maintenance of a database, and practical indicators, on trends in development assistance in Georgia.  Utilizes research findings to assist SO Teams to refine overall efforts to achieve SOs and associated intermediate results, taking into consideration decreased budgets and other constraints.  As a resource, operates at the strategic level, rather than at an operational and implementation mode.  Analyzes trends with respect to the implications for future economic growth in Georgia, and makes recommendations for action to managers.  As directed, organizes and leads internal Mission exercises to identify the broad parameters of new assistance initiatives and interventions, to serve as input for larger USAID/Georgia design efforts. 
Performs other duties as assigned or required.

The resulting gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection is a prototype system demonstrating the ability to control the temperature of the analytical column over a wide temperature range, from 5&#61616;C above ambient to over 300&#61616;C, with temperature ramping at rates above 100&#61616;C per minute.  This will be done without a traditional air bath oven for the analytical column, eliminating substantial footprint, bulk, and power consumption compared to a traditionally-designed system, while increasing the speed of the system for completing analysis.
