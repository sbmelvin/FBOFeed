<DESC>The resulting engineering/logistics services will develop a prototype reliability-based maintenance and logistics support model for the LANTIRN Laser Transmitter-Receiver (LTR) for Precision Attack System Program Office evaluation.  The model will incorporate applicable USAF logistics support, supply support and maintenance characteristics and the reliability characteristics to provide a simulation model of the LANTIRN LTR.  More specifically, the functionality of the simulation will allow for ?what-if? analysis to measure potential effects from changes in LTR reliability, spares availability and serviceability condition, transportation, maintenance capacity and throughput and user operations.

Existing proprietary model design exists from USAF and Army applications that define DOD and USAF logistics, supply, and transportation characteristics.  These design modules will be adapted for use by the LANTIRN LTR simulation.  Previously developed defaulting mechanisms exist and will be used to accommodate shortfalls in available LANTIRN LTR data.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Strategic War Planning System (SWPS) Modernization

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to: (1) inform industry of a Strategic War Planning System (SWPS) modernization requirement, (2) inform industry of the establishment of a SWPS library, and (3) inform industry of a SWPS Industry Day.

The United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) operates the SWPS, which is a computing environment composed of software, personal computers, workstations, servers, and networks used to build and maintain classified national war plans.  SWPS provides USSTRATCOM planners with the automated tools necessary to generate detailed information and output data used to complete the planning, simulation, analysis and production of various operational plans.  The changing political and military environments have underscored a need to modernize the current planning system.  USSTRATCOM will transform the current SWPS to implement initiatives contained in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the FY04-08 Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), and the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).  The transformational requirements, which have been documented in an Operational Requirements Document (ORD) currently in Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) coordination, include:

1.	Changes in the threat areas.
2.	Changes in attack option structure and the number of options.
3.	Changes in the strategic forces and integration with regional commander forces.
4.	Integration of DoD community analytical and planning applications.
5.	Reduced planning timelines.
6.	Collaboration of decision-makers. 
7.	Changes in the force composition and reduced timelines for adaptive plans.
8.	Increased workload to support theater commanders.
9.	Improvements in system flexibility and responsiveness.

The current system provides support to the war planners utilizing tools that are integrated through an enterprise database.  While a systems architecture has not been defined for the transformed system, the functional architecture envisions an evolving system in which workflow is controlled through an executive manager and various plan options are generated through an optimizer.  In support of the latest Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition policy, dated 4 Jun 02, the primary mission of our acquisition system is to rapidly deliver to the warfighters affordable, sustainable capability that meets their expectations.  It is the Government?s objective is to develop a close relationship with industry and academia experts to mutually develop a best value Request For Proposal (RFP) for this upcoming potential contract effort.  The Government intends to pursue a SWPS program acquisition consisting of two phases by achieving a down-select from at least two contractors in Phase 1 to one contractor in Phase 2.  The objective of Phase 1 is to minimize SWPS program cost, schedule, and performance risks; gather information for Phase 2 decisions including but not limited to software size, program planning, risks, cost drivers, schedule, staffing, and rough estimate of Phase 2 cost.  The objective of Phase 2 is to support the Government in the modernization of SWPS.  For Phase 1, the government anticipates to award identical contracts for approximately 6 to 9-month periods of performance to multiple contractors.  The contracts awarded in Phase 1 will include an opportunity for Phase 2, which will be the development and sustainment of selected SWPS functionality and systems integration support.  

Additionally, the Government envisions that the current SWPS application contractors will continue to maintain and enhance their products that support the SWPS program.

The Government may conduct a Sources Sought effort to develop a Highly Competitive List (HCL) of offerors for this effort.  Further DRAFT information will be released using the 55 Contracting Squadron?s public web site at www.offutt.af.mil/55thwing/55lg/55con/swps.htm.  The website will contain SWPS background information for industry review and comment to assist in development of the RFP.

The Government is concerned that although there are experts in industry that fully understand SWPS at a sub-system level, there are few, if any, that understand SWPS at a system level.  Since the upcoming modernization is envisioned to include two new system level functions, successful contractors for this potential effort will require a system level understanding.  The Government intends to open a library to provide information on the existing SWPS requirements and components.  The objective is to provide potential offerors knowledge on the SWPS environment and the future NPR vision.  Since the majority of the information is at the SECRET level, potential offerors are required to have a current SECRET clearance level.  The library will be located in the Curtis E. LeMay (USSTRATCOM) Building, and offerers will need to schedule appointments to visit the facility.  Information about library rules and how to schedule library visitation times can be found on the Contracting Squadron website (see previous paragraph for website address).

The Government intends to host an Industry Day in the Dougherty Conference Center on Offutt AFB on Wednesday, September 18, beginning at 8:30 a.m.  The intent of the Industry Day is to share with industry SWPS information and discuss the acquisition effort.  Participation in the Industry Day Conference is voluntary.  The information presented therein will not obligate the Government in any manner.  All individuals wishing to participate in the Industry Day must have a minimum of SECRET clearance.  Each company is allowed to bring up to six representatives.  To register for the Industry Day, contact the 55th Contracting Squadron SWPS Contracts Manager at (402) 294-3271 no later than September 6 (also reference the Contracting Squadron website for further details about this event).  Attendees MUST adhere to the Dougherty Conference Center?s rules and regulations.  The Dougherty Conference Center?s rules and regulations may be downloaded from the Contracting Squadron website.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any cost associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.  

This announcement neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Please direct any questions on this announcement to Captain Dave Huber, Contracts Manager, (402) 294-3271, e-mail david.huber@offutt.af.mil, or Ms Jeanne Fairley, Contracting Officer, (402) 294-4505, e-mail jeanne.fairley@offutt.af.mil.

Formal LEED certification (as outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council) may be pursued, dependent upon project budget.  Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project.  Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence, the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated.

STAGE II: In this stage, the entire project TEAM, including each A-E Design Firm selected in Stage I, its designated lead designer, and all consultants who will work on the project will be evaluated. The short listed A-E design firms will submit Standard Forms 254 and 255 for the entire project TEAM for the final selection process. Sufficient time will be provided for the A-E design firms to establish project teams.  Information shall be provided to describe the team?s capabilities and accomplishments with an emphasis on the projects that the team has collaborated on previously.  CONSIDERATION FOR SELECTION will be based on the following criteria: (1) PROPOSED PROJECT TEAM: Key personnel background and qualifications including previous relevant experience. (2) PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Proposed project planning, scheduling, team coordination, cost control methods, quality control methods, and production facilities. (3) DESIGN ABILITY: Visual and narrative evidence of the proposed team?s design ability with respect to renovation and modernization of building systems. (4) EXPERIENCE: Experience on projects with similar size and scope. Experience with GSA and/or other Government design contracts, including experience with Federal Government regulations and specifications, evidence of effectiveness and ability to coordinate with Federal authorities. The Government will establish the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews and final selection process with the Stage I short list announcement.
 
Consideration is limited to firms having an active design production office in the State of California (Geographical Limit).  A joint venture and/or a firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of members to provide a quality effort.  The Key Firm of any proposed joint venture and/or firm/consultant arrangement must have an existing active office within the designated Geographical limit and must demonstrate the capability to perform all contract services. 

The Procurement is open to both large and small business under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Before the award of the contract the selected firm shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established national subcontracting goals of 40% for Small Businesses, and 5% for Disadvantage Businesses, 5% for Small Women-Owned Businesses, 3% for Small Veteran-owned Businesses, and 2% for HUB Zone Businesses.  In support of the agency?s effort, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the above goals.  Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority A-E firms are encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages the contributions of new and innovative designers to public architecture. Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged firms as part of their original submitted teams.  Before award of the contract the A-E (if not a small business having an average gross receipts of less than $4M during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  

Offerors are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference to discuss project requirements and the selection process.  The conference will be held in the Arizona Room, 2nd floor, at the Federal Building at 450 Golden Gate Ave, San Francisco, CA on September 4, 2002 at 10:00 am.

<DESC>The Government requires the following: Firm, Fixed Price supply contract to be negotiated on a sole source basis with Olympic College, for Apprentice/Trainee program classes. The awarded contract will cover tuition, fees and materials for 434 participants in the Apprentice Program and 229 participants in the Co-operative Education Helper Program during 2003 academic year (Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer quarters). The specific training is necessary for skilled shipyard workers of various trades to reach the journeymen level at PSNS.  The Program is a lock-step program in which training is viewed in terms of phases or yearly blocks of training rather than quarters of training in the traditional college sense.  The Apprentice Program has been in place since 1902, and in its present form with Olympic College since 1950.  Olympic College is the only community college located in Kitsap County and within close proximity of the PSNS that can adequately accommodate more than 650 appointees in the program.  Over time, they have developed classes, such as College Level Principles of Technology and College Level Applied Mathematics, that are proprietary to the program.  It is anticipated that the RFQ will be issued on or about 26 August 2002, with quotes due by 06 September 2002.  No telephone requests for the solicitation package will be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Firms that meet the requirements listed in this announcement are invited to submit one copy each of the completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated below. Site visits will not be arranged during the advertisement period.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis. Interested firms are requested to include telefax numbers, DUNS number, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 255 and 254 in Blocks 3 and 1, respectively. Interested firms are also requested to include their A/E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) number on the SF 255 in Block 3. In Block 10, state why your firm is specially qualified based on the selection evaluation criteria. Also, use Block 10 to provide additional information desired by your firm.

The A/E firm's primary person proposed to be the direct day-to-day contact with EFA Chesapeake throughout the contract work must be identified as the "Project Manager." Information in the cover letter and any other attachments will not be included in the official selection review process. Submit (received by mail or hand delivered) the SF 254 and 255 to the mailroom in the EFA Chesapeake building, Building 212, by 3:30 p.m. on the established due date. Fax copies of the SF 254 and 255 will be accepted. This is not a request for proposal. Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns. The small disadvantaged business set-aside goal in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5% of the subcontracted work. This set-aside goal of not less than 5% also applies to women-owned small business concerns. This does not apply if the prime firm is a small business concern. Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to receiving a contract award. This database provides basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer. A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur. Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at <http://www.acq.mil/ec>; through any DOD certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414. Contracting Officer, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake (Attn: Erik Young, Code CH34), Washington Navy Yard, Building 212, 1314 Harwood St., SE, Washington, DC 20374-5018.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB), plans to procure services for Occupational risk factors for kidney cancer in Central and Eastern Europe from the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC), Unit of Environmental Cancer Epidemiology, 150 Cours Albert-Thomas, 69008 Lyon, France.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees2.  The Occupational Epidemiology Branch is primarily involved with epidemiology studies of occupational and other risk factors for cancer.  In 1998, investigators at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) launched a case-control study of kidney cancer in six centers in Central and Eastern European countries to evaluate risks in relation to occupational exposures from IARC  under previous purchase order.  Countries are Bucharest, Romania; Brno, Olomouc, and Prague in Czech Republic; Lodz, Poland; and Moscow, Russia.  Collection of data from the eastern European case control study will be complete in the Fall of 2002.  The purposes of the proposed project include 1) the coordination of the collection of diagnostic slides and preparation of formalin tumor tissue blocks for approximately 1000 kidney cancer cases in the Eastern European kidney cancer case-control study, 2) the coordination of quality control procedures across the collaborating study centers (Bucharest, Prague, Brno, Olomouc, Lodz, Moscow) and; 3) the shipping of the samples to NCI.

<ARCHDATE>09302002
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Carole Laplante, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-9714
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541513   This procurement has been awarded sole source to the following: University of Texas CBA 6.482 Mail Code B6900 Austin, Texas   78712 Phone : 512-239-0218 This requirement has been awarded in the amount of $35,000. Statement of Work Integrated Grant Management  System Deployment Planning and Support I.   Background  The purpose of this contract is to develop materials and provide consultation services to EPA and its recipients in the deployment of the Integrated Grant Management System(IGMS).  IGMS is an automated system which models the grant process  from beginning to end.  The grant process is defined as follows:    EPA identifies grant programs which offer funding for certain projects.  Grant applicants develop a proposed project workplan and apply for the grant.  EPA reviews the grant approves the expenditure of funds and commits the money  for the project.  EPA awards the grant to the grantee and the grantee accepts it.  The grantee submits administrative and programmatic reports concerning the grant.  EPA closes out the grant. While some benefits accrue when EPA uses the system for its own internal processes, to maximize the  savings from IGMS, both the applicant and EPA staff must use the system.  As IGMS is deployed throughout the EPA Regions, these Regions are preparing to reach out to the applicant community to offer them the opportunity to begin using IGMS to conduct grant business with EPA.  Successful deployment  to the applicant community presents a challenge in that EPA personnel are unfamiliar with the recipient business process and yet must be able to provide the recipient community the tools they need to understand how the system will help them operate more efficiently with a minimum investment in  training and administration.   The contractor will develop deployment materials for applicants including examples of mapping IGMS to a recipient business process, assignment of roles, responsibilities of the application administrator, and basic models for initial interactive tests of the system.   The contractor will participate with the Regions in on-site or telephonic/video meetings with recipients to describe and demonstrate system operations and benefits and answer questions regarding implementation in recipient organizations.  Sessions may also require the contractor to facilitate  business process mapping, direct training or demonstration of the training module, and on-site system tests by recipients.    The contractor will provide consultation services on system administration issues relative to server setup and communication, user registration and troubleshooting.  The  contractor will also test newly designed or modified modules from the applicant perspective and provide feedback on Abugs@ and functional shortcomings.  II. Period of Performance  The period of performance for this requirement is October 1, 2002 to September 30, 2004. III. General  Instructions  To accomplish the tasks defined below, the contractor shall: 1) conduct discussions with EPA grants and program staff, the national IGMS team, and recipient organizations who use and plan to use the system, 2) prepare and deliver deployment support materials to EPA reviewers and  interested recipient organizations, get feedback on their usefulness and revise them, 3) deliver presentations to recipient organizations, 4) facilitate deployment planning meetings with EPA staff and recipient organizations, 5) train application administrators, 6) troubleshoot implementation  problems, 7) test system functions, and 8) document frequently asked questions and lessons learned.  All written materials should be brief and to the point.  Where possible, written materials should include straightforward diagrams, checklists, and cheat sheets, as opposed to lengthy textual  discussions.  Material should be written to be understood by a target audience with at least basic knowledge of the grant process and minimal knowledge of computers.  Where meetings, presentations, consultation or troubleshooting result in new learning, the contractor will document it either as a  Frequently Asked Question or as a Troubleshooting Tip.  Materials may be submitted in Microsoft Word or Word Perfect format for easy conversion.  Bills should be submitted monthly by task.  Deliverables, e.g., trip report, deployment material, should accompany the bill unless the deliverable is  due on a tighter deadline. IV. Tasks  The contractor will be responsible for delivering services in the following categories.  The quantity of services in Tasks B through E is an estimate.  To meet the needs of the recipient community and contingent on approval by the permission of the project  officer, the contractor may perform more of one service and less of another.  A. Develop Deployment Materials for Recipient Organizations   To provide recipients with a simple approach to understanding and deploying the IGMS system, the contractor shall develop deployment materials including but  not limited to the following: description (may be graphic) of IGMS; management level briefing describing the system and its benefits; protocol for system demo with sample documents identified and recipient experiences;  deployment checklist with sample time line; description of roles in state  terms; hardware/software requirements for both versions of IGMS; sample case of complete grant application review process cross-walked to IGMS; cheat sheets of key processes; glossary of key IGMS terms; core team functions list,  instructions on registering new users and Frequently Asked Questions  for trouble-shooting.

Duration  Upon work assignment approval through September 30, 2003. IV. Background Title IX of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires EPA to assess the ecological and human health impacts of Title IV. EPA is also required under the CAAA section 812 to assess  the environmental and human health benefits of the entire CAA. EPA determined in December 2000 to regulate mercury emissions from coal and oil fired power plants, the same sources that contribute a large percentage of acid rain precursor emissions. In February 2002, the Bush Administration issued  the ?Clear Skies Initiative? that would develop a cap and trade program to achieve significant reductions in mercury emissions from power plants. Therefore, EPA considers it reasonable and necessary to assess water quality, ecological and human health impacts of proposed legislation and other  strategies to reduce emissions of mercury and acid rain precursors from power plants. Furthermore, EPA is required by OMB to include cost and benefit information in the Regulatory Impact Analyses provided with each proposed rulemaking. The Assessment and Communications Branch (OAR-Clean Air Markets  Division) has the responsibility to assess Title IV and proposed emissions reduction programs related to power generation. This work will assist EPA to analyze and assess information regarding the effects of mercury in the environment for use in quantitative or qualitative benefits analysis.  V.    Contract Level and Statement of Work Reference The tasks to be performed under this task order are consistent with the areas of analyses authorized in section ___ of the contract?s Statement of Work. VI.  Statement of Work Tasks The contractor will plan, coordinate, run, and do appropriate  followup activities for a small workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to gather scientists currently working in the field of mercury assessment in order to develop a plan to assess the environmental and ecological impacts of reductions in mercury emissions. In particular the workshop attendees  will focus on identification of appropriate environmental or ecological indicators that will allow policy-makers to adequately assess environmental changes due to reductions in mercury emissions. The focus will be on proposed reductions in emissions from power generators, and include methods to  identify current conditions ( a baseline) as well as future conditions. The workshop will be planned by a small planning committee that will include the Project Officer, a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) representative, a representative from the Ecological Society of  America, and several scientists. The workshop will be invite-only with the invitee determined by the planning committee and be approximately 2 days in length.  Deliverables will include the workshop, a report to EPA of workshop results, a manuscript submitted to a SETAC or other comparable  publication outline on the workshop conclusions, and a short summary article published in the ESA Bulletin or other comparable publication. VII. Level of Effort   Approximately 900 hours VIII.  Deliverables and Schedule Item Date Form workshop planning committee April 15, 2002 Finalize  workshop time, location, and invitation list May 31, 2002 Finalize participant list June 30, 2002 Hold workshop September 2002 Draft report for EPA October 31, 2002 Draft manuscript November 15, 2002 Draft short summary article November 15, 2002 Finalize report for EPA January 2003 Finalize  manuscript January 2003 Finalize short summary article January 2003 Submit manuscript for publication February 2003 Submit short summary article for publication February 2003

   Truck Performance Detector Site Requirements


1.	Site should be located on a level grade. 
-If grade is not level, the predominant traffic pattern should be uphill. (Data from downhill traffic will be very ?scattered?, making trends difficult to discern.)

2.	Length of first curve should be a minimum of 500-ft long.
-Gage circuits need to be approximately 250-ft. from the spiral.
3.	Length of tangent (between curves) should be a minimum of 500-ft long.
-Gage circuits need to be approximately 250-ft. from the spiral.
4.	Length of reverse curve should be a minimum of 500-ft long.
-Gage circuits need to be approximately 250-ft. from the spiral.

5.	Lube condition must be consistent. 
-There should be no differential from the high to low rail.

6.	Track condition should be evaluated for new installations.
a.	Railhead profile should be considered for load analysis (not excessively worn).
b.	Track geometry should be within FRA Track Class 5 limits.
c.	No road crossings or special track work should be located within the test site. (?Jostling? of the trucks due to track perturbations may provide inaccurate results.)

7.	Power (solar with battery backup preferred) and a hard-wired phone line are required for site installation at trackside bungalow.

8.	A 6?X6? or larger main bungalow is needed with power and communications lines at this location (Usually within 50? of the tangent gages). Smaller enclosures (2?X2?X3? NEMA Box or larger) are required at the remote (curve) locations with power provided at both of these locations.


9.	Year round access is needed for maintenance and upgrades. 










Truck Performance Detector System Requirements


1.	The TPD shall collect vertical, lateral, AoA (Angle of Attack), and AEI (Automated Equipment Identification) data. AEI readers maybe provided by the operating railroad. 
2.	The TPD shall collect data from 6 cribs of strain gages. Two located in the body of a right hand curve, two located in a tangent, and two located in the body of a left hand curve.
3.	The TPD shall be calibrated at the time of installation.
4.	The TPD shall produce site alarms based on measured and calculated performance values.
5.	The TPD shall incorporate robust hardware and adequate lightening protection for operation in harsh environmental conditions.
6.	The TPD shall transmit all collected data to the InteRRIS? database @ TTC in the appropriate format.
7.	The TPD shall perform data integrity checks before any data is transmitted to InteRRIS? and before any alarm is transmitted.
8.	Contractor will be responsible for the purchase, shipping, and installation of all TPD hardware and software. Installation will be somewhere within the continental United States. 
9.	The TPD shall include a 1 year limited warranty.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for Paradox Valley Unit, Operation, Maintenance and repair, Bedrock, Colorado, Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Project. The Paradox Valley Unit is located in Bedrock, Colorado, 21 miles west of Naturita, Colorado on Highway 90.  The facilities are south of the Bedrock Bridge on the east side of the Delores River.  The principal features of the work consist of providing all personnel, small tools, equipment, and operation and maintenance, consumables necessary to operate,  maintain, and repair the Paradox Valley Unit 24 hours X 365 days a year.  The Paradox Valley Unit is a multi-faceted deep well injection facility that is part of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Project.  The process is a non-conventional method of salinity control that intercepts and disposes of naturally occurring brine by extracting the brine from a shallow aquifer adjacent to the Delores River in Paradox Valley and injecting the brine under high pressure (5,000 psi) into a well which is approximately three miles deep.  The process is controlled via a state of the art Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and accompanying instrumentation.  Each facility contains various valving, piping, pumps, and instrumentation that requires scheduled and unscheduled periodic maintenance and replacement.   Project safety is a high priority because the Paradox Valley brine contains high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide.  The hydrogen sulfide is a gas that naturally evolves from the brine throughout the process and collects in storage tanks, piping, and, in the event of a pipe leak, in the buildings.  Hydrogen sulfide is lethal in concentrations found commonly throughout the facilities and special considerations must be made which include a minimum of two personnel operating the unit at all times.  The contract is for a base year and 4 one year options.   The site visit is on September 11, 2002 at 9 a.m. Meet at the Paradox Valley Unit (PVC) office located 1/4 mile south of Colorado highway 90 on the Dolores River. Turn south on the east side of the Bedrock Bridge. The BOR office is the white trailer.  The work will be performed under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 561210.  "All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.  To obtain a copy of the Solicitation go to (www.fedbizopps.gov), Federal Business Opportunities.

<CONTACT>Kittie S. Ellison, Contract Specialist (805) 228-0601; Ann Marie Hagan, Contracting Officer (805) 228-8920.
<DESC>This amendment is issued in response to questions received on combined synopsis/solicitation N63394-02-R-1129, the following responses are provided:   Question 1: The solicitation requires resumes for key personnel.  Our count of key positions is as follows:  3 Project Manager position; 1 Sr. Field Engineer position; and  11 Field Engineers.  Is it correct that the Government desires resumes for all of these positions?  Response:  There is 1 Project Manager who will work different shifts within certain work weeks or months, thus the total 1920 labor hours was divided between the three different shifts, 1 Senior Field Engineer, 11 Field engineers plus 1 Logistician.  Resumes are required for all Key Personnel including the logistician.  Question 2:  Statement of Work received appears to be incomplete.  The paragraph numbering goes from 2.8 to 2.10, skipping paragraph 2.9.  Several  paragraphs within the Statement of Work refer to subparagraphs in paragraph 2.9.  Response:  The Statement of Work is complete.  Paragraph 2.10 in the Statement of Work should have read 2.9.  Correction to this paragraph and subparagraphs will be corrected in the award document including Contract Data Line Items (CDRL).  Question 3: The solicitation calls out FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, As Amended (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.).  If the Service Contract Act applies, which Wage Determination applies?  Response:  That clause was not checked and therefore does not apply.  Question 4:  Progress Payments Clause, FAR 52.232-16.  This clause allows monthly invoicing at a percentage of costs incurred.  When will the government accept liquidation of the progress payments, i.e. invoicing of the remaining full contract value, monthly, at completion of the individual activities , or contract value, monthly, at completion of the individual activities, or at the completion of the contract?  Response:  FAR Clause 52.232-16 Progress Payments (Feb 2002) is hereby deleted.  Invoicing procedures is addressed in FAR Clause 52.212-4 entitled Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items (Apr 1998) Question 5:  Statement of Work 2.2, Corrective Maintenance.  What is the procedure in the event the equipment is deemed un-repairable?  Suggest that any equipment deemed un-repairable shall be removed from the inventory listing and considered deleted from the contract requirements, after exhaustion of attempted resolutions through in-house and/or subcontracting methods, upon COR approval.  Response:  If OEM or government can not isolate failure or procure required replacement parts, the equipment is excessed (surveyed) and used for any good materials remaining, at  which time it is no longer the responsibility of maintenance.   Question 6:  Statement of Work paragraph 3.0, Equipment Performance Requirements.  We suggest that all inoperative equipment documented on the monthly report or special report as being out of the contractors control, i.e. out of stock repair parts, manufacturers warranty repair, etc. shall be excluded from the Operational Availability calculation.  Response:  The method of computing operational availability does indeed account for what we refer to as dead time, the time that the equipment is unavailable while awaiting repair parts, is not considered as down time.  However, to prevent Easter-egging only one long dead time is permitted awaiting parts on any Tred equipment.  Any additional waiting time is considered down time.  If equipment can be used (the problem can be worked around fully), down time is wai ved and for Ao calculations, the equipment is operational.  Percent Ao equals equipment available hours divided by equipment required times 100 or allowing for awaiting parts dead-time is (equipment required hours) minus (time not available minus dead-time) divided by equipment required hours times 100.  ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION REMAIN UNCHANGED.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT THREE TO NRC'S SOLICITATION NO. RS-ACR-02-300 ENTITLED "TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES AND POLICY SUPPORT".  The closing date for receipt of all proposals in response to this solicitation is changed from 3:00 PM, on 8/26/02 to 1:00 PM, NRC local time, on 8/30/02.  The following are responses to questions received from from offerors, regarding this solicitation.

1.	Senior Fellow Type Services:

It is IST's understanding that the contracted position is intended to provide Senior Fellow type technical and advisory services and support to both the ACRS and the ACNW.  

Is the above statement a correct understanding of the contracted position type-of-services?

Response:  Yes.  The contracted position is intended to provide technical service and support  to both the ACRS and the ACNW.  

2.	Technical Resource Pool:

Based on the scope of topics that could potentially be assigned under this contract, the breadth of topics mostly likely will go beyond the experience base of any individual consultant.  Therefore, it is concluded that it is the USNRC's intent for this contract is to provide a technical resource pool of highly skilled and experienced senior personnel who can be assigned accordingly to specialized ACRS and ACNW task assignments.

Is the above conclusion a correct understanding of the USNRC's intent?  Please clarify.

Response:  Proposals for either a resource pool of available personnel or a single individual are acceptable.  It is not the USNRC's intent to preclude proposals involving a single individual.

3.	Personnel - Reference Check Qualifications:

If this contract is to be a technical resource pool, it is recognized the USNRC will qualify the key contractor consultant(s) as part of the contract review and ratification process.  Is it the USNRC's intent regarding other potential project consultants:

	(a)	to qualify (reference check) each individual consultant at the time of contract negotiations, or

	(b)	to qualify (reference check) each individual consultant when they are identified during the performance period as a resource commensurate with a specific task assignment?

Please clarify intent and approach.

Response:  It is the USNRC's intent to qualify individual proposed consultants during the proposal evaluation phase of the procurement.  

4.	Concurrent or Sequential Level-of Effort:

The Solicitation (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Section 3. Estimate of Effort) states that the contract authorization will be for 2,087 man-hours (one FTE) for a base 12-month period (FY 2003).  The Solicitation (Section 4. Options and Surge Periods) also states that the USNRC could authorize funding for two additional 12-month periods (FTEs) to support "surges and options."

Will the two one-year (FTEs) options (if exercised by the USNRC) be concurrent with the base year (all in FY 2003) or will they be option years (FY 2003, FY 2004, FY 2005) sequential to the base year?  Please clarify.

Response:  The two one-year (FTE) options are for FY 2004 (one-year) and for FY 2005 (one-year), and will follow the base year, if exercised.
5.	Fixed Fully Loaded Hourly Rate Structure:

 The Solicitation (Modification 01, Section PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS PRICING) states the following: "The fixed fully loaded hourly rate under this contract shall include ALL CHARGES, direct, indirect, etc, costs."

The Solicitation (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Section 4. Options and Surge Periods) identifies the travel (a direct cost element) requirement without definition.  IST recognizes that there is the potential for travel within the United States and to international nuclear sites (reactor, and/or repository) in, for example but not limited to, Czech Republic, Russia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Canada, and South Africa.  Based on the international travel potential, the direct costs for travel can be extensive.  Is it the USNRC's intent that the hourly rate and travel directs be structuult in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.

	(v)  Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical area for the NRC at the same site.

	(2)	  The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as provided in ?2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:

	(i)  Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered by the specifications.

	(ii)  Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive procurements using the approaches or methodologies.

	(iii)  Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programs that could form the basis for a later procurement action.

	(iv)  Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary information of its competitors.

	(v)  Where the award of a contract might result in  placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.

	(c)	Policy application guidance.  The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor organizational conflict of interest situations.

	(1)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For  Proposal (RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as called for in the RFP.  The ABC Corp. is one of several companies considered to be technically well qualified.  In response to the inquiry in the RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.

	(ii)  Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be placed in a position in which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC.  Because there are other well-qualified companies available, there would be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy.

	(2)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one type of advanced reactor.  As is the case with other technically qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects for several different utility clients.  None of the ABC Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP.  Based on the NRC evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.

	(ii)   Guidance.  An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias with respect to the work.  An appropriate clause would be included in the contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for work with the private sector that could create a conflict during the performance of the NRC contract.  For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded from the performance of similar work for the company developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.

	(3)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance documents on the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR Part 20.  ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable.  ABC Corp. has performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future.  The work has and will cover the writing, implementation, and administration of compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.

	(ii)  Guidance.  This situation would place the firm in a role where its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC.  Because the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy, in accordance with ?2009.570-9 may be warranted.  Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of this policy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.

	(4)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of developing standards that are important to the NRC program.  The ABC Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry once its practicability has been demonstrated.  Other companies in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific reactor component.

	(ii)  Guidance.  A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will be used in the contractor's private activities unless this information has been reported to the NRC.  Data on how the reactor component performs, which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive advantage.  When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the information may not be used in the contractor's private activities unless the information is generally available to others.  Further, the contract will stipulate that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the performance of the reactor component under the contract, is proposed to be used.

	(5)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold belt.  In accordance with the representation in the RFP and ?2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently doing seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area contemplated by the NRC study.

	(ii)  Guidance.  The contracting officer would normally conclude that award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role where its judgment might be biased.   Section 2052.209-72(c) Work for Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create a conflict of interest during the term of the NRC contract.

	(6)(i)  Example.  AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental review of applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities.  ABC Corp. is divided into two separate and distinct divisions, AD and BC.  The BC Division performs the same or similar services for industry.  The BC Division is currently providing the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract for an applicant or licensee.

	(ii)  Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be awarded to the ABC Corp.  The AD Division could be placed in a position to pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias its work for NRC.  Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to ABC Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company.  If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be sought in accordance with ?2009.570-9.

	(7)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites.  Three months later, ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis at another of its sites.

	(ii)  Guidance.  Section 2052.290-72(c)(3) would prohibit the contractor from  beginning this work for the utility until one year after completion of the NRC work at the first site.

	(8)(i)  Example.  ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin reactors.  The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 million.  Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests authority to solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to transport spent fuel to a disposal site.  ABC Corp. is performing no other work for the utility.

	(ii) Guidance.  The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to proceed with the solicitation because  it is not in the same technical area as the NRC work; and  the potential for technical bias by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the relative value of the two contracts.

	(9)(i)  Example.  The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and installing new turbines at a reactor site.  The contract with the utility is for five years and has a total value of $100 million.  ABC Corp. has responded to an NRC Request For Proposal requiring the contractor to participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at the same site.  The estimated value of the contract is $75K.

	(ii) Guidance.  An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to the utility that  may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
 
	(d)	Other considerations.

	(1)	The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.

	(2)	It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis.

?2009.570-4  Representation.

	(a)	The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships exist which may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particular offeror or contractor.  The procedures apply to small purchases meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph (b) of this section.

	(b)	The organizational conflicts of interest representation provision at ?2052.209-71 must be included in solicitations and contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals.  The contracting officer must also include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for new work for:

	(1)	Evaluation services or activities;

	(2)	Technical consulting and management support services;

	(3)	Research; and

	(4)	Other contractual situations where special organizational conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be included in the resulting contract.  This representation requirement also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the contract except those issued under the "Changes" clause.  Where, however, a statement of the type required by the organizational conflicts of interest representation provisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of the statement is required.

	(c)	The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion.  Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the evaluation of proposals.  If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work and its exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable.

	(d)	The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is considered to be a minor informality.  The offeror will be permitted to correct the omission.

?2009.570-5  Contract clauses.

	(a)	General contract clause.  All contracts and simplified acquisitions of the types set forth in ?2009.570-4(b) must include the clause entitled, "Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest," set forth in ?2052.209-72.

	(b)	Other special contract clauses.  If it is determined from the nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of interest exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with ?2009.570-9, neutralized through the use of an appropriate special contract clause.  If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and conditions of these clauses, including the extent and time period of any restriction.  These clauses include but are not limited to:

	(1)	Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of production contracts following a related non-production contract previously performed by the contractor;

	(2)	Software exclusion clauses;

	(3)	Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and

	(4)	Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and guard against its unauthorized use.

?2009.570-6  Evaluation, findings, and contract award.

	The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted by an offeror and other relevant information.  After evaluating this information against the criteria of ?2009.570-3, the contracting officer shall make a finding of whether organizational conflicts of interest exist with respect to a particular offeror.  If it has been determined that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting officer shall: 

	(a)	Disqualify the offeror from award;

	(b)	Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or

	(c)	Award the contract under the waiver provision of ?2009.570-9.

?2009.570-7  Conflicts identified after award.

	If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified after award with respect to a particular contractor and the contracting officer determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to terminate the contract, as provided in the clauses required by ?2009.570-5, the contracting officer shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with ?2009.570-9, neutralize the effects of the identified conflict.

to be performed under an NRC contract which:

	(1)	May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased work product; or

	(2)	May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.

	Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award of a proposed contract.  The term potential conflict of interest is used to signify those situations that 

	(1)	Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether award would give rise to an actual conflict; or

	(2)	Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if they arise during contract performance.

	Research means any scientific or technical work involving theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.

	Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and subcontracts in amounts not exceeding $10,000.

	Technical consulting and management support services means internal assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or administration of its programs, projects, or policies which normally require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information or to information that has not been made available to the public.  These services typically include assistance in the preparation of program plans, preliminary designs, specifications, or statements of work.

?2009.570-3  Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.

	(a)	General.

	(1)	Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:

	(i)	Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?

	(ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantage based on the performance of the contract? 

	(2)	NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business judgment based upon the relevant facts.  While it is difficult to identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all of the various situations or relationships that might involve potential organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs.  Any work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely scrutinized by the NRC staff.

	(b)	Situations or relationships.  The following situations or relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest: 

	(1)	The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following circumstances.  The information may include the scope of work or specification for the requirement being performed, the period of performance, and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.

	(i)  Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also providing consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.

	(ii)  Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.

	(iii)  Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services, or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services of another entity.

	(iv)  Where the award of a contract would res

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT FIVE TO NRC'S SOLICITATION NO. RS-ACR-02-300 ENTITLED "TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES AND POLICY SUPPORT".  The following is additional information regarding NRC's Organizational Conflicts of Interest provisions.  PLEASE REFER TO AMENDMENT SIX FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE PROVISIONS.

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Acquisition Regulation
Final Rule effective October 12, 1999

Subpart 2009.5   Organizational Conflicts of Interest

?2009.500  Scope of subpart.

	In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed in accordance with ?2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with respect to organizational conflicts of interest.  Where non-conflicting guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.

?2009.570  NRC organizational conflicts of interest.

?2009.570-1  Scope of policy.

	(a)	It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize contractor organizational conflicts of interest.  The NRC achieves this objective by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons (including those regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.

	(b)	Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made automatically or routinely.  The application of sound judgment on virtually a case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be applied to satisfy the overall public interest.  It is not possible to prescribe in advance a specific method or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest situations that might arise.  However, examples are provided in these regulations to guide application of this policy guidance.  The ultimate test is as follows:  Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may have an unfair competitive advantage?

	(c)	The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies to contractors and offerors only.  Individuals or firms who have other relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not covered by this regulation.  This rule does not apply to the acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment process, NRC agreements with other Government agencies, international organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments.  Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these agreements, as appropriate.

?2009.570-2  Definitions.

	Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual controls or has the power to control another, or when a third party controls or has the power to control both.

	Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with the NRC except as provided in ?2009.570-1(c).

	Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or their successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed consultants or subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the NRC.

	Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a technology, process, product, or policy.

	Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, or their affiliates or successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, or subcontractors, submitting a bid or proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.

	Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or planned interests related to the work red as follows:

a.	the fixed fully loaded hourly rate shall include all labor, indirect, and all direct costs including a contingency covering estimated direct costs (there would be no direct cost funding allocation in the contract for any travel direct costs); ORb.	the fixed fully loaded hourly rate shall include all labor, indirect, and direct costs except
travel directs (air fare, subsistence, lodging, auto rental) for which a separate travel direct cost
authorization (estimated) shall be established for the subject contract?   Please advise.

Response:  Travel directs (air fare, subsistence, lodging, auto rental, and incidental travel
expenses) will be paid by the NRC for any NRC authorized travel.  The loaded fixed labor rate
includes all charges except travel costs.  A not to exceed annual cost ceiling will be established
in the awarded contract for local and domestic travel.  The ceiling may be in creased by the
NRC Contracting Officer, during the contract period, if deemed necessary. 

6.	Travel:

The Solicitation (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Section 6. Government Furnished Equipment, Facilities, and Service) states that the USNRC will provide all resources needed when the contracted consultant is working in the ACRS/ACNW office.
It is concluded that the contract consultant must use his own resources for travel planning and scheduling.  The USNRC "Travel Office" resource to plan and schedule needed travel for the contracted consultant is or is not within the context of the referenced Section 6? Please clarify.

Response:  The USNRC "Travel Office" will be the resource used by the contract consultant to plan and schedule all NRC authorized travel.
		
7.	International Agreements of Nuclear Cooperation

The Solicitation (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Section E. Experience, Skills, and Standards of Performance) states, " Working knowledge of evolutionary and advanced reactor designs currently under consideration in the United States and foreign countries.  IST has extensive experience regarding evolutionary and advanced reactor programs in the United States and at international sites and has had direct working relations with international program principals.  In consideration of International Agreements of Nuclear Cooperation and IST's direct experience, it is concluded that the international programs can be a resource for the contracted consultant to support ACRS/ACNW assigned tasks.

Is the above statement a correct understanding of the interface and use of international resources?  Please advise. 
  
Response:  International programs can be a resource for the contracted consultant subject to any restrictions that exist for NRC access to this information.

8.	Laptop Computer

Please advise regarding USNRC policy for the use of personal laptop computers (contractor owned) in the ACRS/ACNW office by the contractor's key personnel.

Response:  Contractor owned laptops can be used subject to proper measures being taken to protect stored information.   Use of contractor owned laptops would be subject to the same restrictions as the use of laptops owned by ACRS/ACNW members and staff.

9.  The solicitation estimates that 2,087 hours or effort will be required annually.  This is 
approximately one man-year.  Moreover, the solicitation implies that the contractor should 
propose one fixed priced fully loaded hourly rate.  Finally, the solicitation states that "individuals performing work must be available on essentially a full-time basis."  All of the foregoing 
suggests that the NRC is looking for one, full-time, dedicated individual.  However, the 
experience, skills, and expected standards of performance suggest that a number of individuals
will be required to cover the diverse elements of the statement of work.  How can a number of individuals be committed on a full-time basis if each will be used only a fraction of the time?  How can one fixed hourly rate be proposed for a number of individuals with varying rates?

Response:  Proposals for a resource pool of available personnel or a single individual are acceptable.   Proposals which utilize a number of individuals with expertise in particular areas, rather than a single individual, must  commit to making these individuals available as needed by the ACRS and ACNW.

10.  What will be the conflict-of-interest requirements imposed on the contractor and on the employees/consultants individually?

Response: Please refer to the Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart  2009.570-1 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest), and 48 CFR Subpart 2052.209-72 and 73 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest).  For example, specific emphasis should be placed by the Offeror on the prohibition against review of its own work.  Please refer to Amendment Five to NRC's Solicitation No. RS-ACR-02-300 for additional information regarding NRC's Conflicts of Interest provisions. 

11.  Is there a small business subcontracting requirement for this procurement?

Response:   No.  A subcontracting requirement is applicable for all large businesses, as provided for under the appropriate Federal Acquisition Regulations.

12.  How can the various prospective bidders be identified?
					
Response: As referenced in Amendment No. Two to Solicitation No. RS-ACR-02-300, a separate amendment will be issued that provides a listing of the names of companies interested in teaming arrangement in performance of the required services.  This will be the only listing available.  All information, including amendments, regarding this solicitation is  posted at the www.fedbizopps website.  Consequently, the NRC does not know who the various prospective bidders are/will be for the requirement as we are not provided such notification from Fedbizopps, of the various parties viewing the website in regards to the NRC's requirement.

13.  Is there an incumbent currently serving the ACRS and ACNW?

Response:  There is not an incumbent serving the ACRS and ACNW performing the work described in this solicitation.


14.  Is there a potential for multiple awards as a result of this solicitation?

Response: The intent is that one contract will be awarded.

15.  Should the option periods referred to in the SOW be considered concurrent (e.g. up to 3 full time equivalent (FTE) in the performance period) or sequential (e.g. 1 FTE each for three years)?

Response: The two one-year (FTE) options are for FY 2004 (one-year) and for FY 2005 (one-year), and will follow the base year, if exercised.  

16.  Will the cost of travel required of the contractor from the Washington DC area to other venues be borne by the NRC?
 
Response:  Travel directs (air fare, subsistence, lodging, auto rental, and incidental travel expenses) will be paid by the NRC for any NRC authorized travel.  The loaded fixed labor rate includes all charges except travel costs.  A not to exceed annual cost ceiling  will be established in the awarded contract for local and domestic travel.  The ceiling may be in creased by the NRC Contracting Officer, during the contract period, if deemed necessary.

17.  What is the minimum bases documentation (e.g. bases for overhead multipliers, bases for labor rates, profit margin stipulation) does NRC require in the Cost Proposal?

Response: There is no minimum bases documentation.  All offerors are required to provide cost information that substantiates allocable and allowable  bases for the proposed overhead, labor and profit. 

18.  Is there a preferred format for addressing the FAR provisions and clauses within the management portion of the Technical and Management Proposal? 

Response: No.

19.  Would involvement of a potential contractor in work for any of the NRC offices constitute a situation of conflict of interest for the present solicitation? 

Response:  Please refer to the Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart  2009.570-1 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest), and 48 CFR Subpart 2052.209-72 and 73 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest).  For example, specific emphasis should be placed by the Offeror on the prohibition against review of its own work.  Please refer to Amendment Five to NRC's Solicitation No. RS-ACR-02-300 for additional information regarding NRC's Conflicts of Interest provisions. 

20.  Does NRC require either:

        (a)     One contractor individual with all the required expertise to be attached to ACRS/ACNW offices as technical support on a full-time basis, or
      (b)     Several contractor staff each having expertise in specific areas fulfill the Government requirements?

Response: Proposals for either a resource pool of available personnel or a single individual are acceptable.  It is not the USNRC's intent to preclude proposals involving a single individual.

21.  Can potential contractors include external (to the contractor organization) consultants for some of the technical areas listed in the solicitation?

Response: Offerors are not prohibited from proposing the use of subcontractors.

22.  For cost/pricing purposes - How many trips and to what US or international locations should be considered?

Response:  Travel directs (air fare, subsistence, lodging, auto rental, and incidental travel expenses) will be paid by the NRC for any NRC authorized travel.  The loaded fixed labor rate includes all charges except travel costs.  A not to exceed annual cost ceiling will be established in the awarded contract for local and domestic travel.  The ceiling may be in creased by the NRC Contracting Officer, during the contract period, if deemed necessary. 

23.  If a company is awarded this contract, will this contract with the ACRS/ACNW disallow, in any way, that same company from doing work for NRC's Offices of Research, NMSS, or Nuclear Reactor Regulation?  In other words, is there an imposed intra-NRC conflict-of-interest provision that would compromise the company's ability  to obtain work from the non-ACRS non ACNW part of NRC?

Response: Please refer to the Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart  2009.570-1 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest), and 48 CFR Subpart 2052.209-72 and 73 (NRC Organizational Conflict of Interest).  For example, specific emphasis should be placed by the Offeror on the prohibition against review of its own work.  Please refer to Amendment Five to NRC's Solicitation No. RS-ACR-02-300 for additional information regarding NRC's Conflicts of Interest provisions. 

24.  The announcement states that "The contractor will provide services on a fixed priced fully loaded hourly basis."  Is the following statement regarding this provision correct?:

	Say, for example, that an Offeror proposes six individuals who together 
	meet the SOW qualifications.  The Offeror will provide in the proposal the 
	fixed hourly rates for each of the proposed individuals (and any escalation in those hourly rates over the total period of performance).  The Offeror will not provide an estimated total cost for the base year (2087 person-hours over a 12-month period) for that mix of individuals.

Response: The total annual level of effort for this contract is 2087.  Each Offeror is required to propose a total cost for each year (base year and option years) based on either a resource pool of available personnel or a single individual. 

25.  Please provide instructions regarding the hand delivery of proposals to the USNRC White Flint facility on 26 August 2002.

Response: All hand-carried proposals including those made by private delivery services (e.g., Federal Express and Airborne Express) must be delivered to the NRC loading dock security station located at 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852 and received in the depository located in Room T-7-I-2.  All offerors shall allow extra time for internal mail distribution.  NRC is a secure facility with perimeter access-control and NRC personnel are not available to receive hand-carried offers except during normal working hours, 7:30 AM - 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to promote competition.	This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to seek industry comments and inputs concerning the maintenance and operation of the Socioeconomic Data and Application Center (SEDAC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). This EOSDIS DAAC is required to provide products and services for policy formulation and decision making which combine Earth science and socioeconomic data and to improve the exchange of data and information between Earth science and socioeconomic data users.  This DAAC is the institutional element within the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE).  This DAAC must work with other DAACs, which provide operational data and information services for other disciplines.  This DAAC has two areas of equal priority.  First is the development and consequent operation of applications, which support the user community.  The other is the improvement of the exchange of data and information between Earth scientists and socioeconomic data users. The ESDIS Project is interested in awarding or renewing a contract for acquiring and archiving SEDAC type data with a group that would work cooperatively with the ESDIS Science Operations Office (SOO) and the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).  The functions of this facility would include, but are not limited to:	1) Data acquisition and application development as necessary to support the SEDAC mission.	Types of SEDAC data categories include:	 (1) natural resources, (2) environmental indicators, (3) population dynamics, (4) economics, (5) public health, and (6) policy and institutions 2) Archive and distribution for all data sets that SEDAC is the primary source. 3) Sustain and expand the existing Information Gateway between the Earth science and socioeconomic science communities. 4) Sustain a SEDAC socioeconomic directory consistent with the formats of and interoperable with the Global Change Master Directory. 5) Sustain a granule-based inventory for socioeconomic data archived and distributed by SEDAC. 6) Populate a SEDAC Guide. 7) Perform all data systems operations and any related manual operations associated with data ingest, data maintenance, generation of new products, maintaining and updating metadata, and data and information services for users. 8) Perform sustaining engineering needed to optimize the data systems. 9) Participate in the EOSDIS Operations Working Group. 10) Ensure long-term integrity and viability of the data products it generates or holds. 11) Distribute data and products to users electronically and/or on media. 12) Generate information products defined by the SEDAC-developed applications. 13) Provide user services to support the SEDAC user community. 14) Participate in the EOSDIS User Working Group. 15) Establish and maintain an effective SEDAC User Working Group. 16) Establish and maintain a formal configuration management process 17) Provide regular activity and financial reports.	18) Interact with the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Alliance and NASA Headquarters. 19) Strong understanding of the socioeconomic user community. 20) Fully staffed with trained engineers and operators Geographic Constraints: 1) This facility should be resident at or have a strong partnership with a university to encourage education outreach, academic involvement and scientific research. Infrastructure Constraints: 1) Site must posses an acceptable level on personnel and network security.   2) The facility should already exist and require little modification. 3) Data networks and communication systems should already be in place and available for use. Management Constraints: 1) Management and personnel should already be familiar with managing data acquisition, product generation, archiving, and distribution of socioeconomic data. 2) Management must have experience coordinating and conducting operations with NASA and foreign agencies. For an understanding of the scope of the maintenance and operation of the SEDAC DAAC respondents should review the provided references. These documents serve as a backdrop against which respondents must frame and pose the appropriate advanced information technology topics for further consideration: Reference and URL	1. SEDAC Website  http://sedac.ciesin.org 2. Sample Statement of Work http://romulus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 3.

<DESC>BACKGROUND

SARI/ Equity supports? efforts in the region to address two key issues: 1) human rights concerns that arise from inequity, such as trafficking, violence against women, and child labor; and 2) the need to promote opportunities for disadvantaged groups to participate equitably in society.  Through SARI/Equity, USAID seeks to raise the profile of equity and promote rule of law and respect for human rights as key development concerns in South Asia and as USAID priorities in the region. SARI/Equity is part of a three-pronged approach to help integrate the region, recognizing the U.S. foreign policy interest in promoting regional stability and security in South Asia

The SARI/Equity framework addresses two key elements of the equity problem: 1) encourage the implementation of laws, measures and practices aimed at reducing human rights violations against vulnerable groups, and 
2) promote the adoption of measures that provide greater opportunities for the equitable participation of women and children in social, political, educational, and economic life. Sub-elements of these two main elements are the following:   
Sub-IR 1: Increased Capacity to Implement Relevant Laws and Conventions; 
Sub-IR 2:	Strengthened Advocacy for Passage and Implementation of Relevant Laws and Conventions; 
Sub-IR 3:	Increased Public Awareness and Engagement in Combating Women?s and Children?s Inequity;  and 
Sub-IR 4:	Increased Development of Enabling Programs and Practices, such as micro-finance, basic education, and psycho-social counseling.

Specifically, in July 2000 USAID funded UNIFEM to manage and implement a five-year regional anti-trafficking program.   Along with trafficking, USAID expects to provide additional bureau and country-specific support under SARI/Equity on issues that represent human rights concerns that arises form inequity such as violence against women and child labor, as well as areas that enhance social and economic opportunities for disadvantaged groups.  In addition to the UNIFEM arrangement, the initiative will plan to engage support from an institutional contractor or cooperator to manage and support regional activities including regional reporting.   It is expected that each mission will designate a senior level officer to serve as the SARI/Equity program liaison officer, who will be also be a key member of the SARI/Q management team.
