<DESC><p>Synopsis<br />Purchase, 7 BLU-109/B Warhead Case Test Assets &amp; Test Hardware</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron is contemplating the sole source award of a purchase order to <br />Rand Machine Products, Inc., 2072 Allen Street Extension, Falconer, NY, 14733. It is intended that the award be made to support the on-going test and qualification of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and design enhancements to accommodate AFX-757 explosive fill in the BLU-109 penetrator warhead. A November/December 2009 award is anticipated for the procurement of test hardware and seven (7) altered BLU-109/B warhead cases:<br />Four (4) BLU-109 Warhead Cases are to be configured as BLU-109C/B Case Assemblies, Empty (200827956-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Y/B 6-Hole Nose Vent, Case Assembly, Empty (X68509003-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Z/B Nose Hole Vent, Case Assembly, Empty (X68509004-010).<br />One (1) BLU-109 Warhead Case is to be configured as a BLU-109Z/B Nose Hole Vent, Case Assembly, Modified, Empty (X68509004-030).<br />BLU-109Y/B and BLU-109Z/B cases will be used for testing conceptual IM improvements in accordance with MIL-STD-2105and MIL-STD-810. The BLU-109C/B case will be used to back fill test hardware inventory. The BLU-109C/B configurations are based on the preexisting BLU-109/B case configuration with the incorporation of the following improved components: Aft Fuzeliner, Aft Fuzeliner Retainer, Charging Tube Fitting, Charging Tube Nut, Charging Tube, 9-Hole Vented Aft Closure, and Aft Closure Retaining Ring Assembly. The BLU-109 Y/B and Z/B are base on modified BLU-109/B case configurations with the incorporation of the aforementioned improved components. The procurement of 7 empty BLU-109 warhead cases can only be met by Rand Machine Products because of their experience/qualification in the manufacturing of penetrator internal parts in support of Ellwood National Forge and their exclusive expertise in the manufacturing of the Eutectic Closure Retainer Ring Assembly. Additionally Rand's tooling, fixtures, inspection, and machine programming further enhances it's justification as sole source for the test assets and test hardware. The aforementioned capabilities will allow deliveries in time to meet our testing schedule. Without Rand's support in this effort the Penetrator and IM program efforts would have to stop testing until a new contract is competed and a new vendor is qualified. The Government estimates that this can take one year and would adversely impact the testing schedule and overall Program Plan by an additional one year. Rand's previous manufacturing support of 685 ARSS IM/BLU-121 test asset procurements and BLU-117, BLU-109, and BLU-122 production contracts has consistently proven to be technically sound, cost effective, and timely. Test hardware component parts will be used in support of IM test efforts on as needed basis. Eutectic, DELRIN, &amp; UHMWP/TIVAR nuts will be evaluated by the contractor to ascertain threat strength at elevated temperatures. BLU-109 Salt Fog Test Fixture and remaining test hardware to be used in Government IM testing on as needed basis.</p>
<p>Hardware shall be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) drawings. The contractor shall remove the hardware corresponding to those items listed above (Test Hardware Component Parts) from the eight (8) Government provided BLU-109/B warhead cases and install the improved hardware components IAW Empty Case Assemblies, Empty, BLU-109C/B, Y/B, Z/B, and Salt Fog Test Fixture. The contractor shall perform periodic inspections of the assemblies and the hardware it is manufacturing to ensure compliance with associated drawing(s). Inspection data shall be available for review upon request. A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 12 months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a contractor to manage the BLM Meadowood Stables located in Lorton, VA.  Performance will be from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011 with four additional one year option periods.  A brief explanation of the required services is as follows:The purpose of this contract is to provide services for the administration and operation of public horse boarding on portions of the equestrian facilities located at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Meadowood Recreation Area, Lower Potomac Field Station.   The Contractor may apply to BLM to offer public riding lessons and/or trail rides under a Special Recreation Permit (SRP), which is separate from this contract.   The Meadowood equestrian facilities include stables, pastures, outdoor and indoor riding areas, storage buildings, and access to equestrian trails.  During the life of the contract, BLM may rebuild, demolish, or construct portions of the facilities and will attempt to minimize impacts to operations during such activities.  At the time of contract award approximately 30 privately owned boarded horses may be present at the facility.  The total number of boarded horses will be reduced during the life of this contract through attrition and/or BLM decision.  Not less than 15 stalls or, if more, as authorized by BLM, will be available for boarded horses or a combination of boarded, lesson and trail horses.  In the event the Contractor obtains an SRP for public lessons or trail rides, the Contractor may elect to replace boarded horses when they leave with Contractor lesson or trail horses, if approved by BLM, in order to diversify operations and increase public use of the facilities.  BLM will not be liable for any payment to the Contractor for any unoccupied boarder horse stalls or stalls with non-boarder horses (e.g., trail or lesson horses).  BLM will only be liable for payment for occupied boarder horse stalls.  The project area is located at 10406 Gunston Road, Lorton, Virginia.  The property is within the BLM Lower Potomac Field Stations Meadowood SRMA in Fairfax County, Virginia.  Currently, the project area consists of an estimated 20 acres or more of fenced pasture, use of 15 stalls in a stable of 47 stalls, two wash stalls, and approximately 1,900 square feet of covered storage buildings which include a 28 x 28 feet building (approximately 780 square feet), two equipment bays (10 x 30 feet each), a workshop (24 x 30 feet) and an office (10 x 10 feet).  The project area also includes shared use of an indoor riding arena of 10,800 square feet (60 feet x 180 feet), use of a farrier building, outdoor riding areas and access to equestrian trails on the 800 acre property.  BLM may rebuild, demolish, or construct portions of the facilities during the contract.
This is not a complete listing of the specifications.  It is intended only as a guide to help vendors decide whether or not to download the solicitation.  The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L10PS01765, which will ONLY be available at http://www.fedconnect.net on or about December 14, 2009.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses under NAICS Code 115210 (average annual receipts for the preceding 3 fiscal years not to exceed $7 million).

<DESC>The Department of Energys Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy(ARPA-E)announces this competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) tosolicitapplications for cooperative agreements for the Electrofuels program.ARPA-E isseeking new ways to make liquid transportation fuels - without usingpetroleumor biomass - by using microorganisms to harness chemical or electricalenergyto convert carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. Many methods of producingadvancedand cellulosic biofuels are under development to lessen our dependence onpetroleum and lower carbon emissions. Most of the methods currently underdevelopment involve converting biomass or waste, while there are alsoapproaches to directly produce liquid transportation fuels from sunlightandcarbon dioxide. Although photosynthetic routes show promise, overallefficiencies remain low. The objective of this topic is to develop anentirelynew paradigm for the production of liquid fuels that could overcome thechallenges associated with current technologies. ARPA-E requests innovativeproposals which can overcome these challenges through the utilization ofmetabolic engineering and synthetic biological approaches for the efficientconversion of carbon dioxide to liquid transportation fuels. ARPA-Especifically seeks the development of organisms capable of extractingenergyfrom hydrogen, from reduced earth-abundant metal ions, from robust,inexpensive, readily available organic redox active species, or directlyfromelectric current. Theoretically such an approach could be 10 times moreefficient than current photosynthetic-biomass approaches to liquid fuelproduction.

<DESC>The Department of Energys Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy(ARPA-E)announces this competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) tosolicitapplications for cooperative agreements for the BATTERIES FOR ELECTRICALENERGYSTORAGE IN TRANSPORTATION (BEEST).In this topic, ARPA-E seeks to develop a new generation of ultra-highenergydensity, low-cost battery technologies for long electric range plug inhybridelectric vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs). The development of highenergy,low cost batteries represents the critical barrier to wide-spreaddeployment ofEVs, which if achieved would have a profound impact on U.S. oil security,greenhouse gas emissions, and economic growth. The ambitious goals for thisprogram are largely based upon the aggressive long term EV battery goalssetforth by the United States Automotive Battery Consortium, a public-privatecollaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy and leading U.S.automotivecompanies. If successful, new battery technologies developed under thisprogramwill give electrified light-duty vehicles range, performance, lifetime, andcost required to shift transportation energy from oil to the domesticallypowered U.S. electric grid. ARPA-E's objective is to fund high-risk, highreward research efforts that will promote leadership in this emerging EVbattery market.

<DESC>The Department of Energys Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy(ARPA-E)announces this competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) tosolicitapplications for cooperative agreements for the INNOVATIVE MATERIALS ANDPROCESSES FOR ADVANCED CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY (IMPACCT).Coal-fired power plants currently generate approximately 50% of theelectricityin the United States. While coal is a cheap and abundant resource, thecontinued reliance upon coal as an energy source could potentially haveseriousconsequences in terms of global warming. The objective of this topic is tofundhigh risk, high reward research efforts that will revolutionizetechnologiesthat capture carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, therebypreventingrelease into the atmosphere. ARPA-E seeks to complement existing DOEefforts inthe field of carbon capture, led by the Office of Fossil Energy andNationalEnergy Technology Laboratory, by accelerating promising ideas from thebasicresearch stage towards large-scale demonstrations and ultimately,commercialization. Areas of interest include: low-cost catalysts to enablesystems with superior thermodynamics that are not currently practical duetoslow kinetics; robust materials that resist degradation from causticcontaminants in flue gas; and advanced capture processes that dramaticallyreduce the parasitic energy penalties and corresponding increase in thecost ofelectricity required for carbon capture.

The contractor, West, Inc., completed the simulation analysis to determine the feasibility of obtaining a robust population estimate for Chukchi/Bering seas polar bear population from an icebreaker with helicopter support.  Dr Ryan Nielson prepared a final report summarizing the results of the simulation analysis in November 2008, under previous government contract with USFWS, Investigation of the Properties of an Aerial Line transect Survey for Polar Bears in the Chukchi Sea Using Computer Simulation and the USFWS would like to prepare a manuscript and publish the results in a peer reviewed journal.  Dr Ryan Nielson has been identified as the only source that can provide economical work under the proposed contract because of his extensive experience in this project.  It would be unethical and a breach of intellectual property rights to have someone else take the report without the consent of the principle authors and publish it as their own. 
The manuscript will be written and submitted prior to September 20, 2010.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the government does not intended to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Ordela, Inc. in Oak Ridge, TN for the purchase of an Ordela Model 1050X X-ray counter and an Ordela Model AIM-206 PSPC Position decoder.  

NIST currently has an Ordela X-ray Diffraction System already in use in the lab. Should any other equipment capabilities differ from the instrument already in use, it will compromise the integrity of the analysis of the data and would make it extremely difficult to get accurate results if different equipment were to be mixed and matched and the purchase of the subject equipment only will ensure compatibility. 

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 21, 2009.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This item is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Parvus is the only manufacturer of an off-the-shelf militarized controller that meets MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-801 and that meets the minimum performance requirements.   Development time for another vendor to ruggedize this component would take 6-9 months which would have a negative impact on the MVCS project schedule.  In addition this would result in increased cost for another vendor to develop an equivalent unit.  The current system has been design to meet the set requirements stated above.  Any changes to the product will cause a slip in the delivery of the units to the LCS ship 3 and 4 Seaframe.  Software has been designed to utilize current hardware set, affecting development of software with any changes.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54162   Notice of Proposed Contract Action - Modification to Increase Contract Ceiling
The US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) intends to increase the contract ceiling for the current Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Time and Materials Contract EP-W-08-013: "National Agricultural  Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reporting of Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions" with Colorado State University by $986,400.00, effectively increasing the total estimated cost from 1.2M to 2.2M. The current contract procures contractor support services for greenhouse gas inventory reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with an expiration date of January 2013. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620: Environmental Consulting Services. Areas of support include: designing strategies for voluntary emissions reductions programs; providing inputs for emissions projects and economic analyses; funding authors on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and guidelines; and, preparing software for greenhouse gas inventory analysis. 
The modification to increase the contract ceiling is required in order to support the work initiated under an Interagency Agreement (IAA) with USAID, focusing on greenhouse gas inventory capacity building for developing countries. The work initiated under the IAA is similar in both scope and complexity to the on-going work under current contract EP-W-08-013; specifically, the scope of work under the USAID/EPA IAA includes:-     Working in targeted region(s) to increase the quality of      GHG Inventory data inputs for the agricultural and land            use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors.  -     Training GHG inventory experts within each country on      the Agriculture and Land Use (ALU) Software tool,            developed by Colorado State University, to assist            countries in compiling, archiving, updating and managing       greenhouse gas inventories in the agriculture and       LULUCF sectors.  This will include several training       sessions for each country.  This could involve 12-16       trainings within a target region.-     Improving the ALU software tool to include uncertainty       estimates for the emission/stock change estimates,       optimizing the functionality of the tool, as well as a       developing a mitigation module that can be used by the       countries to evaluate potential mitigation opportunities in       the Agriculture and LULUCF sectors.-    Customization of ALU software tool for target regions. This modification builds and expands upon the work currently performed by Colorado State University, utilizing the critical Agriculture and Land Use (ALU) Software tool, developed by Colorado State University, to accomplish the greenhouse gas inventory capacity building within developing countries. 

While it is the government's intent to issue this modification under the existing contract with Colorado State University, interested parties with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform this requirement are invited to identify their interest, and submit a brief capability statement.
This notice is not a request for technical and cost proposals. EPA will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor reimburse the costs incurred by interested parties who respond to this notice. Interested parties should provide a concise capability statement, limiting the response to 2 single-sided pages.  Capability statements must include: (1) Complete Business Name; (2) Contact Information (address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail); (4) Business size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA certified 8(a), HUBZone, etc.). Capability statements must address technical competencies, and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas. Finally, general financial and organizational information should be provided with regard to the following items:  (1) average number of employees of the concern; (2) average annual receipts based on the last three fiscal years; (3) a description of other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (4) a description of the concern's accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs - and whether or not such system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.
Capability statements should respond to all items requested in this notice to allow EPA to conduct an accurate business assessment.  Standard brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.  Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements. All responses should be sent via e-mail to sas.faye@epa.gov.

The QCM system also excels in sensitivity (nanogram sensitivity), in its optimization for bio-interface applications and environmental applications, its hardware and software capabilities for dissipation analysis of elastic film (10-7 measured delta D in Liquid), and in the wide range of coated crystals available for the unit  (this is needed as the coating will be used as models for range if environmental surfaces) All of these features are critical requirements for the environmental research applications which this instruments will be used. The QCM technology has played an important role in measuring thin film deposition on surface in manufacturing and interfacial chemistry research and is now beginning to be applied to environmental processes studies. This instrument will be used to explore the basic phenomena governing colloidal (natural colloidal materials and made-made nanomaterials) interactions with model soil and sediment surfaces (ex. The silicon dioxide and polystyrene coated crystals) A better understanding of these interactions will improve our ability to model the fate and transport of colloids and nanomaterials in the environmental.  EPA has identified Q-Sense, the only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, "only one responsible source".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory, intends to make a non-competitive award to The European Space Agency (ESA) for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Envisat satellite.  The ESA is the sole provider of SAR images from the Envisat satellite.  The Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Applied to Volcano Studies project has a requirement for SAR images that project staff use to monitor ground deformation at all potentially active volcanoes in the US and at selected volcanoes elsewhere in the world.
The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive procurement to the European Space Agency (ESA) of Franscati, Italy IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The European Space Agency owns and operates the ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat C-band radar satellites.  No other agency (or country, including the United States), has operational radar satellites with tight orbit control such that radar interferograms can be produced on a regular basis and that have an archive that dates back to 1992.  
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these data shall submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.
For further information, please contact Sasha Klingler, Contracting Officer, at sklingler@usgs.gov. 
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-37, effective 13 November 2009.

<a href="mailto:jason.kuhns@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Congress directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to manage appropriations totaling over $5.4 Billion (B), since fiscal year 1992 (FY92), for intramural and extramural programs directed toward targeted medical research initiatives.  The US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is responsible for administering these targeted research program appropriations, and manages them through its office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP).  The CDMRPs vision is to find and fund the best research to eradicate diseases and support the war fighter for the benefit of the American public.<BR><BR>The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program was established in FY92 by Appropriations Conference Committee Report No 102-328, which provided $25 Million (M) for research on breast cancer screening and diagnosis for military women and their family members.  In 1993, grassroots efforts by the breast cancer survivors and advocacy communities, led to a FY93 congressional appropriation of $210M for peer reviewed breast cancer research.  <BR><BR>The CDMRP sought the advice of the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) on how to best invest the $210M congressional appropriation.  While the IOM made several important recommendations, a pivotal one outlining a two-tier review process for evaluating and selecting research proposals has become a cornerstone within CDMRP.  This novel two-tiered process involves reviewing every research proposal for scientific merit as well as programmatic relevance.  <BR><BR>The first tier of the two-tier review process is peer review.  Peer review is a criteria-based process where proposals are evaluated based on their scientific and technical merit.  Proposals are evaluated by scientific discipline, specialty area, or award mechanism by scientific, technical and consumer peer reviewers.<BR><BR>This support is currently performed by an external scientific peer review contractor because the CDMRP office does not have the capability or the expertise to perform these duties in-house.  <BR><BR>The CDMRP is the USAMRMC subordinate organization responsible for planning, coordinating, integrating, programming, budgeting, and executing these programs.  For a better understanding of the CDMRP, a web site is available to provide a wealth of information about each of the programs:  http://cdmrp.army.mil.  The Government intends to award a Time and Materials Task Order Requirements Contract to provide scientific peer review for all Congressionally Direct Research Programs identified herein and any subsequent programs as directed by Congress.  It is anticipated that the award will be for a two-year base period and include three single year options.  Separate task orders shall be awarded under this contract for each research program peer review by FY.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel to provide scientific peer review for each of the selected scientific programs.  All interested parties should email their interest to Jason Kuhns at jason.kuhns@amedd.army.mil.<BR>

<DESC>USTRANSCOM/TCAQ anticipates issuing a RFP on or about 27 November 2009 for rail chain tiedown assemblies in support of rail operations.  

This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside competition, lowest cost, firm fixed price contract.

Specification for Chain Tiedown Assembly 

1. Assemblies and their components shall conform to all requirements of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), as of the date of shipment, as found in the current edition of the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, as amended. AAR publications can be ordered by calling toll-free 877-999-8824. 

2. Assemblies shall have a working load limit of not less than 13,750 lbs., a proof test of not less than 27,500 lbs., and a minimum breaking strength of 55,000 lbs. 

3. The Government shall receive certification within 30 days from date of award from a certified independent testing laboratory, confirming that at least three assemblies out of five supplied and tested and otherwise meeting this specification have been proof tested without distorting the chain links and have been tested to the minimum breaking strength without failure (distortion, as contrasted with separation, of chain links at forces beyond the proof test limit will be not be consider failure). The report shall be sent directly from the testing laboratory to the Government (Johnny.Lanctot@ustranscom.mil, address Johnny M. Lanctot, USTRANSCOM TCAQ-S, 508 Scott DR, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5357). The testing laboratory must disclose how many series of five assemblies were tested in order to produce a successful test outcome. If more than one series is tested the testing laboratory must enclosed reports on the failed test series as well. If the testing laboratory furnishes a report on more than one test series, the Contractor shall furnish the Government with a letter detailing what corrective actions, if any, were taken by the Contractor between each test series. The testing and report shall be adequate to meet the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.7.9 requirements for load binder testing and approval. 

4. The assemblies shall include the following components: 
a. A chain anchor device which shall interface with the standard flat car tiedown anchor channel by matching four pairs of projections on the anchor with corresponding notches in the anchor channel. The four pairs of projections and notches are necessary to engage enough of the anchor channel to achieve a strength matching that of the chain tiedown assembly. The design and dimensions of the anchor shall permit the anchor to be inserted into a deep anchor channel design at any point along the anchor channel. The anchor device shall be placed at one extreme end of the assembly. 
b. An acceptable load binder of any type mentioned in the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.7.2, provided that it is permanently attached as an integral component in the assembly. Lever-type binders shall be designed such that when lever handles are released from their locking device the handles are not under live load. Ratchet-type and turnbuckle-type load binders shall be lubricated with persistent grease and equipped with a fitting for adding additional lubrication without disassembly. Ratchet-type and turnbuckle-type load binders need not have an attached handle, provided that they can be tightened with an adjustable or monkey wrench. The load binder shall have a locking device to prevent loosening while in transit. The locking device shall not be a jam nut or other arrangement that loses its effectiveness as a result of wear caused by repeated use. 
c. A compression unit or shock absorber to reduce shocks that would otherwise distort the chain or break a component of the assembly when under load. The compression unit or shock absorber shall be functional at least up to the working load limit. 
d. A means of shortening the chain length of the assembly during attachment to a load sufficient for the load binder to tighten the assembly to the required tension. If the device is to be a hook it shall be a claw hook. 
e. A clevis-type slip hook, with the ability to accept at least a nominal 1.75 shackle body and to interface with all equipment tiedown provisions that meet MIL-STD-209K, to be placed at the extreme end of the assembly 
opposite the chain anchor device. The hook shall not have a locking latch or provision for attaching a locking latch. 
f. Chain with a weight not greater than that of nominal  special alloy chain and marked as required by the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.2 and Table 21.5. 
g. A metal tag stamped with, at minimum, Department of Defense, the name of the manufacturer, the year sold, and the manufacturers part number. 

5. Components shall be attached to each other, and compression units shall be assembled, with AAR-approved coupling or repair links, as found in the AAR Open Top Loading Rules, Section 1, paragraph 21.29.1 and Table 21.3. Compression units shall be assembled with devices that shall permit parts to be replaced without the use of cutting or welding. The components shall be attached to each other so that the assembly, when anchored at one end and hooked to a shackle mounted to a vehicle with its pin in a horizontal plane, shall not exhibit a twisting of the chain or of any other component with respect to the component(s) with which it is joined. 

6. Ferrous components other than the chain must be painted or hot dip galvanized, unless forbidden by AAR specifications for the component. 

7. The overall length of the assembly from the attachment point of the anchor to the attachment point of the slip hook shall be not less than 10 with the load binder at full extension.

This requirement will be restricted to small business only.  The contract will be for a period of date of award to 30 September 2010.  The applicable NAICS code is 332999 All Other Miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing and the size standard is $18M.

No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued.  The solicitation will only be available from the following website: http://www.fbo.gov.

<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">RDECOM Natick Contracting Center ICP (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier RD&E Center, is conducting a market survey for technical information on concepts for High Altitude Oxygen Breathing Systems.  Military Free Fall parachutists and aircrews need supplemental oxygen during the performance of the Ram Air parachute operations as well as during unpressurized flights.<BR><BR>The following briefly describe the Oxygen requirements:<BR>" All personnel will pre-breathe 100 percent aviation grade oxygen at or below 10,000 feet MSL pressure or cabin altitude below 10,000 feet MSL pressure on any mission scheduled for a drop at or above 18,000 feet MSL.<BR>" The required pre-breathing time will be completed before the 20-minute warning and before the cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL.<BR>" Any break in pre-breathing requires restarting the pre-breathing period or removing the individuals whose pre-breathing was interrupted from the mission.<BR>" Pre-breathing requires the presence of an Air Force physiological technician onboard the aircraft.<BR>" All personnel onboard during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL and higher will use oxygen. (Exception: Parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes each sortie).<BR><BR>The bailout systems require a duration of oxygen lasting from the time when the parachutist disconnects from the Pre-breathe console, until he descends to an altitude below 10,000 ft MSL at a minimum. Improved Ram Air Canopy systems, in particular when used in High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) insertion operations, have extended and continue to extend the parachutists time aloft.  Future insertion operations could exceed 45 minutes from exit to ground.  Additional race tracks and physical activities within the aircraft can cause jumpers to consume the oxygen volume needed for the descent prior to exit.<BR><BR>Current Pre-breathe consoles are connected to the parachutists bailout system and are designed to supply the parachutist with 100% oxygen without depleting the bailout cylinders.  These consoles are designed to support the pre-breathe requirements of up to 8 parachutists, but in many cases the internal volume of the oxygen supply is inadequate to fully support this mission.  As a result, the consoles are downgraded to support no more than 6 parachutists, and in some cases additional consoles and or large K bottles are installed on the aircraft to support pre-breathing needs and additional racetracks. This equipment is organic to the inserting unit, is left on board the aircraft and needs to be recovered after operations.  In training, this means landing, off loading, and takeoff prior to the next assignment; possibly wasting fuel and time.  Operationally, this is not possible as the aircraft needs to egress in a manner as not to compromise the inserting units mission.  Equipment recovery in this case becomes difficult.<BR><BR>The Military Free Fall community has interest in an Oxygen breathing system that has the duration to support both an individual parachutists pre-breathing and bailout requirements.  This duration should be not less than 2.5 hours threshold and an objective of 4 hours.<BR><BR>Successful development could lead to additional uses for aircrews desiring the freedom to move about the back of the aircraft without an oxygen hose tethering them and restricting their movements.  Other applications may be an emergency egress breathing system (non-fire related), and possibly a smaller more efficient subsurface re-breather for military or commercial use.<BR><BR>Considerations for design:<BR>" The system must be safe for use. <BR>" Must be able to integrate with all existing MFF parachute system to include tandem systems (tandem master and passenger) and tethered bundle systems and not interfere with equipment mountings. Must be compatible with current and future helmet systems to include Gentex, ACH, and Protec, Must not interfere with Navigation systems mounting or readability, Night Vision devices, or Heads Up Displays<BR>" System<BR>o Duration should be not less than 3 hours Threshold and an objective of 4.5 hours.<BR>o Unit size should be as small as possible.<BR>o Gauge should be oriented and large enough to be easily read with or without Night vision devices. <BR>o Shall operate at temperatures ranging from 65 degrees F to 160 degrees F and humidity ranging from zero to 100 %, non-condensing.<BR>o Shall demonstrate a functional reliability of 95% (T) to 99% (O) at a 90% confidence level.<BR>o Must provide a procedure to verify functionality during pre jump and Jumpmaster Personnel Inspection (JMPI) to include tank pressure, leaks, and gas valve flow direction and functionality.<BR>o Frost or ice accumulation outside the bail out oxygen storage subsystem, manifold, hose and regulator, or inside or outside the mask shall not preclude proper operation of the system. <BR>o The breathing mask shall incorporate a communication capability consistant with current communications systems.<BR>o Shall incorporate self-sealing connections and non-crushable hoses where applicable.<BR>o The breathing mask shall be a low-profile mask, attached to the parachutists helmet by a secure mask suspension system that must be capable of withstanding opening shocks up to 15Gs.  During movement on board the aircraft, exit, high-speed free-fall, parachute opening, descent and landing, the mask is to remain securely on the parachutists face.<BR>o Pressurized oxygen storage systems shall be shatterproof, rated at maximum working pressure of not more than 3000 psig and shall meet all applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) certification requirements and Department of Defense (DOD) transport aircraft flight clearance requirements. <BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information. It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice. A pre solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated. No awards will result from this market survey.

<ARCHDATE>12312010
<CONTACT>Sherman L Mayle, Contract Specialist, Phone 9072286244, Fax 9072286254, Email smayle@fs.fed.us - Stephen M. Patton, Contract Specialist, Phone 907-228-6240, Fax 907-228-6254, Email spatton@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Harbor Mountain Road Phase II Reconstruction
(a)	The Forest Service contemplates conducting a two-phase design-build acquisition using the procedures of FAR Subpart 36.3 for the Harbor Mountain Road Phase II Reconstruction project from Mile Post 3.13 to the end of the road at MP 4.73 on the top of Harbor Mountain in Sitka on Baranof Island.  This project is intended to provide for a fully designed, permitted, and constructed surfaced, single lane road with turnouts for 1.6 miles.  Included in the design will be option items for construction of parking areas.   The estimated magnitude of the project is between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000.
 
(b)	The Forest Service has completed the field survey of the existing road adequate to design needed alignment changes, and anticipates being able to make information from the field survey available to potential offerors.  The Forest Service intends to conduct the two phases of the acquisition with a contract award to a single firm by September 1, 2010, if funded.  Information to be provided will include: 
	Design criteria standards
	Proposed borrow and waste disposal sites
	Standard drawing format and typical drawings
	Standard format for plan and profile drawings
	Standard format for cross section drawings
	Project Decision Notice

(c) The Forest Service desires that firms interested in this project as a prime contractor identify themselves by the submission of a brief white paper.  We ask for this paper to be submitted as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) attachment in an e-mail to Jack Oien (jkoien@fs.fed.us), with a cc to Sherman Mayle (smayle@fs.fed.us) by close of business on Monday, December 28, 2009.  The white paper and any accompanying cover letter should be brief (no more than seven (7) pages), should not exceed 1MB in size, and should be written with the intent of helping the Forest Service craft its acquisition approach so we can enhance our ability to obtain the design and construction services at reasonable prices and with efficiency in contractor proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  The white paper should address the following topics:
     (1) The firm's name, address, DUNS number, and point of contact information;
     (2) The firm's size status, such as small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or 8(a) contractor;
     (3) The firm's experience as a prime contractor in design-build acquisitions and as a prime contractor for work similar to this project;
     (4) Advice on whether the Forest Service should issue one solicitation covering both phases, or two solicitations in sequence;
     (5) Advice on the timetable that the acquisition should follow in order to provide for a contract award at the end of phase two by September 2010;
     (6) Advice on the phase one evaluation factors, including the level of design work the Forest Service should seek from competing contractors as part of the phase one effort;
     (7) Advice on the phase two evaluation factors;
     (8) Comments on the suitability of this project for use of the two-phase selection process; and
     (9) Other advice, recommendations, or cautions for the Forest Service as we consider a two-phase design-build acquisition approach for this project.
 
(d) The Forest Service is not scheduling a pre-solicitation conference at this time.  We hope all interested parties will share helpful information with us through the white papers requested above.  The Forest Service has not yet made a definitive decision to issue a solicitation, and it has not made any definitive decisions regarding work scope, acquisition strategy, extent of competition, NAICS code, and so forth.  The information we learn from the white papers will help us as we make these decisions.  Other exchanges with industry may occur in the near future; this may include a pre-solicitation conference or one-on-one meetings with some or all white paper submitters.  Your participation and assistance through the submission of a white paper is appreciated.

<p>Purpose of RFI:</p>
<p>SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) has a requirement to assess existing laboratory operational processes and related IT infrastructure within the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) as well as implement a plan to address deficiencies and additional technology requirements and/or enhancements in an effort to improve overall operations. The goal of the initiative is to leverage industry best practices that will provide improved productivity, enhanced reporting capability, a more seamless service experience to ATP's customers as well as reduce ATP's total cost of services through gains in efficiency.</p>
<p>Organizational Overview:</p>
<p>The ATP partners with the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-F) to provide highly specialized, cutting-edge expertise and support through a tightly integrated, highly effective approach to the study of complex biological problems using a broad spectrum of advanced technologies. The ATP's wide range of cutting-edge technologies accelerates the translation of basic research discoveries into new treatments for patients with cancer and AIDS.</p>
<p>The ATP is comprised of a total of nine laboratories - six core service laboratories and three dedicated laboratories. Historically, each of the laboratories has operated independently in terms of making process improvements, which has resulted in disparate technology implementations making ongoing support and project/financial reporting difficult and costly.</p>
<p><br />Work Scope &amp; Deliverables:</p>
<p>&#61607; Assess existing laboratory and business work flow processes and systems for nine (9) ATP laboratories to identify deficiencies and additional requirements with a focus on the following current key work flow elements that are integral to ATP's operations: 1) customer request; 2) cost estimate and work scope; 3) multilevel project/cost approvals; 4) LIMS [project, sample, and data management]; 5) billing; 6) customer satisfaction feedback; 7) reporting capability; 8) time reporting; 9) PR generation; 10) M&amp;S expense tracking; and 11) supplies inventory management.</p>
<p>The six (6) core service laboratories have an estimated total of 45 work flows; and the three (3) dedicated laboratories have an estimated total of 24 work flows.<br />&#61607; Capture the following information for the systems already in place as part of the data collection effort for documentation of an ATP systems inventory to be prepared by the ATP: 1) laboratory name; 2) system name; 3) administrative point of contact; 4) technical point of contact; 5) functional use of system; and 6) deficiencies.<br />&#61607; Provide a final report that documents the following:<br />a) Feedback acquired from the data collection process for each ATP laboratory. The reports are to be provided in standard use case format for use in future technical development efforts.<br />b) A gap analysis of existing laboratory operational processes against industry best practices for each ATP laboratory as well as an overall summary of the findings.<br />c) Several alternative solutions that will offer options based on required levels of investment for improving operational efficiencies within each laboratory or ATP-wide, as applicable, along with associated costs; benefits; risks; recommended investments in process reengineering, technology, and training; as well as a return on investment analysis for each solution. The recommended alternative should also be identified.<br />Solution requirements:</p>
<p>1. The recommended LIMS solutions must be caBIG compliant.<br />2. Qualification of the ATP laboratories for electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) suitability should be considered.<br />3. SmartStream (SAIC-F's financial system) has the following requirements that need to be considered as part of the solutions:<br />&#61607; The following fields must integrate with SmartStream: 1) center number; 2) item code; 3) CSAS field; 4) project field; 5) quantity; 6) requestor; 7) unit price; 8) PI information; and 9) AO information.<br />&#61607; An output billing file is required for SmartStream.<br />4. Include recommendations regarding priorities for a staged implementation plan. This will include information about connectivity to existing legacy systems currently under reevaluation (CSAS, Yellow Task).<br />Responder Instructions:</p>
<p>Responder must submit a capability statement (10 page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their organization's experience and abilities to provide an assessment and recommendation as described, which includes:</p>
<p>1) the professional qualifications and experience of key staff who may be assigned to perform the assessment and recommendation; <br />2) listing of any/all current and relevant certifications from a qualified neutral third-party and contact information;<br />3) experience in performing laboratory process and technology assessments and strategy recommendations from both a scientific and business operations perspective;<br />4) experience in integrating laboratory and business systems;<br />5) knowledge and experience with LIMS implementations for major companies with similar data and sample processing requirements;<br />6) an estimated itemized cost based on defined work scope and deliverables to include the following breakdowns:<br />d) Provide two separate estimates: 1) estimate for core service laboratories (total of 6 labs) and 2) estimate for dedicated laboratories (total of 3 labs).<br />e) Estimated itemized pricing for the core service laboratories and dedicated laboratories as requested in #6a into estimates for performing a 1) LIMS assessment and recommendation and 2) business systems/process assessment and recommendation.<br />The above cost estimates we understand will be best guess estimates based on the information provided herein and will be used for budgetary planning only.<br />The initial response should include the following Business Information in addition to the capability statement:</p>
<p>1) RFI Number<br />2) DUNS number<br />3) Company Name<br />4) Company Address<br />5) Company Point of Contacts, Phone, FAX, and Email Address.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  

This is a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) and does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a future requirement to support advanced development of domestically manufactured, next generation, portable, fully kitted (for operation out of the box) ventilators through FDA clearance or pre-market approval.  The ultimate purpose of the HHS/BARDA ventilator initiative is to eventually procure (to be determined under a separate procurement contract vehicle) advanced ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile at a cost significantly lower than currently stocked ventilators.  Therefore, a future RFP will also request a design to unit cost estimate with a goal of <=$3000 per unit with tiered volume pricing as a consideration for award and further requires design to cost documentation prior to completion of the contract effort.  The ventilator goal is to advance the technology to meet the operational and clinical needs during an all-hazards event (caused by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear exposure, pandemic influenza, other biological outbreak, or natural disaster) and provide respiratory support for large numbers of severely ill patients.  The ventilator must have increased capability to meet operational and clinical needs for treatment of respiratory compromised patients during an all-hazards event in which mass casualties and shortage of experienced care providers may be expected.  The device should be able to provide the same standard of performance as current FDA pre-market cleared portable ventilators but with additional characteristics that meet the following recommended requirements; ease of use for an unskilled care provider, increased patient population range from neonate to adult, portability and useable in a non-clinical environment, standard of care safety, stockpiling and maintenance ease, and use in all hazards events.  The Government may procure ventilators on a future follow on contract and is interested in defining manufacturing needs through this potential requirement.  Therefore, the Government will also require a domestic manufacturing plan addressing the manufacturing processes, production capacity, and ramp up capability to meet emergency surge requirement to supply at least 1700 fully kitted ventilators in one month and to meet a capability goal of at least 10,000 fully kitted units within six (6) months.  Domestic manufacturing is required as well and a plan to ensure production capability if and when foreign components / supplies would be challenged during an event.  

A potential Offeror must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:

1.  Historical documentation capability of Contractor (or subcontracted manufacturing partner) for at least one manufactured and marketed FDA cleared or pre-market approved ventilator.

2.  Domestic manufacturing for the final assembly of the ventilator.

Attached to this notice is a Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  All five (5) objectives as stated in the Draft SOW must be satisfied with verifiable documentation provided.

It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced approximately January 2010 with proposals due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.  While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met, all of the mandatory qualification criteria must be met by proposal submission.  Proposals that do not meet the mandatory qualification criteria would not be considered for evaluation.  The anticipated period of performance will be 36 months.  The Government anticipates making multiple awards. 

The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 339112.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a set-aside is possible.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.  An organization that is not considered a small business concern under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  HHS/OS/BARDA will not review any submittal received from an organization that is not a small business concern.

Respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, including a response to the requested information above, how they plan to meet the mandatory qualification criteria, the five (5) objectives stated in the Draft SOW, an anticipated delivery schedule of the product, and primary contact information at the organization (name, email, address and telephone number) handling this sources sought notice, in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.  Responses are limited to 10 pages.  Data sets (i.e., tables, charts, graphs) and documents that are pertinent to the response can be submitted as appendices to the primary submission.  All respondents and comments to this sources sought notice shall reference 10-100-SOL-00002 and be submitted to Kim L. Hall, Contracting Officer, at kim.hall@hhs.gov by 2:00 PM EST, December 17, 2009.

The components of this system include the software package and forceps. This system provides realistic simulation of cataract and vitreoretinal surgical procedures and allows beginning ophthalmic surgeons to gain experience in a non-threatening environment with no risk to patients. The Eyesi opens up a new dimension in hands-on state-of-the-art ophthalmic surgery training. The Gold Software Package is an annual software update program designed to ensure the Eyesi system remains state of the art to support education. The hand activated forceps improve the training utility of the Eyesi simulator by better simulating the realities of cataract and retina surgery. Currently, the WTXVAHCS has zero eyesi simulator platforms, or equivalent which are vital to clinical care as they are highly integrated into the surgical training program. These devices used in training ophthalmology residents are greatly enhanced through the addition of the new software and hardware. The Ophthalmology Service is unable to utilize the simulators without the updated software and thus needs the forceps to appropriately simulate real surgery. Without this much needed equipment, the residency program and patient safety may be comprised.All qualified and interested small businesses should notify this office in writing (phone calls will not be accepted) by first-class mail (or email to annette.williams@va.gov) on or before 2:00 p.m. CST on December 17, 2009.

Responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market research/Sources Sought Notice. Responding small businesses should have an active CCR registration, DUNS number and up to date ORCA registrations. SDVOSBs and VOSBs MUST be registered in VetBiz.gov.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a sole source order on the GSA Schedule to PESA Switching Systems, Inc. under authority of FAR 8.405-6 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>PESA equipment as used and configured in the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center has been TEMPEST/security certified by DIA to distribute information at all classification levels within the SCI facility. This security certification is absolutely critical to meeting the user's fundamental requirements, because the video distribution equipment must be capable of simultaneously processing and separating signals across the classification spectrum up to and including TS/SCI. Use of another manufacturer's equipment would revoke the GOC's VDS SCI certification/Approval to Operate. Using equipment other than PESA would require replacement of the GOC's extensive fiber optic-based video signal cable plant at enormous cost and with unacceptable, long term (i.e., 3 month plus) negative mission impact. Further, with severe space/rack limitations in the GOC equipment rooms, replacement equipment must fit within existing space allocation for the GOC VDS. The PESA system is the only integrated set of manufacturer's equipment known to provide the full range of functionality required by the user for their operational command and control processes. Integration of another manufacturer's equipment into the GOC infrastructure would necessitate a massive re-engineering effort to identify parts of the existing infrastructure that would no longer be compatible with a new set of hardware. Once the previously-mentioned re-engineering was complete, a substantial quantity of new peripheral equipment would be needed to be purchased, in addition to the VDS hardware, to overcome interface issues with the potential to drive engineering changes to still other subsystems. A requirement to perform a re-engineering effort would have schedule impacts unacceptable to the user, affecting other critical projects underway. Use of another manufacturer's hardware would likely necessitate an extensive re-training effort to familiarize the GOC battle staff with the new equipment, and violate a user requirement to provide a user interface consistent with that used in the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center at present, to preclude creating a situation where training issues result in loss of personnel effectiveness in time-critical situations.</p>
<p>Procurement through the manufacturer PESA Switching Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis will allow the government a unique opportunity to save a considerable amount in trade-in value by turning in the current GOC PESA equipment for credit.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offers. A determination by the government to not compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 8 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-W-05-050. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #24 is to obligate $101,500.00 for a targeted brownfields assessment (TBA) of the Eaton Sugar Beet Factory located in the town of Eaton, in Weld County, Colorado. The period of performance will be from the date of award (anticipated to be during the week of December 7, 2009) through&nbsp;January 31, 2010. Requirements for TO #24 include the following: 1) participating in a teleconference with the Work Assignment Manager and local area representatives to discuss project, information sources, and goals; 2) prepare draft Phase I Environmental Assessment and Sampling Plan; 3) conduct a site survey and perform sampling; 4) prepare draft Phase II Environmental Assessment; 5) prepare draft report describing clean-up options with cost estimates; 6) prepare final Phase I and Phase II Environmental Assessment Reports, a Cleanup Option Report, and a Property Profile Form (PPF); and, 8) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA" or "the Act"). The Act contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be prformed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of ARRA.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). Responses to this Sources Sought Market Research Announcement will be used by the Government to make an appropriate acquisition decision regarding the use of a brand named product. The purpose of this RFI is to identify construction material/component(s) that are equal to the salient characteristics noted below. The construction material/component is proposed for use on the Intake Dam Modification Project, which is currently in the final design phase. The Intake Dam Modification Project is a joint project under development through a partnership between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The future construction project will consist of two primary project components,a fish screen to prevent pallid sturgeon and native fish from entering the canal during diversion operations,and a fish passage to allow upstream and downstream movement of migrating fish around or over the existing diversion dam.<BR><BR>Preliminary investigations into the fish screen component have been conducted by the interagency team over the past several years.  The team has proposed utilization of stainless steel screens with integrated passive (self-cleaning) or active cleaning systems (mechanical, water jet, or air burst) to remove debris and biological growth which would interfere with flow and screen operations, a patented technology from Intake Screens Inc.<BR><BR>Since the primary fish species of concern for this project is the endangered pallid sturgeon, and no existing screening criteria have been developed for that species, it has been recommended that the screen be designed to meet U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service requirements as specified for salmonid and other anadromous and native fish species on the west coast.  NMFS criteria are specified in technical memos Juvenile Fish Screen Criteria revised February 16, 1995 and Anadromous Salmonid Passage Facility Design, dated February 2008 which include the following guidelines: <BR><BR>a. Where practical and biologically desirable, the screen shall be constructed at the diversion entrance with the screen face generally parallel to the river flow;<BR>b. The approach velocity shall not exceed 0.40 fps (0.12 mps) for active screens or 0.20 fps (0.06 mps) for passive screens;<BR>c. The sweeping velocity shall be greater than the approach velocity (preferably at least two times the approach velocity but no more than 3 fps);<BR>d. The screen material shall be corrosion resistant and sufficiently durable to maintain a smooth uniform surface with long-term use;<BR>e. The screen openings shall not exceed the following dimensions:<BR>0.0938 in (2.38 mm) for perforated plate screens;<BR>0.0689 in (1.75 mm) for profile bar screens (narrow dimension);<BR>0.0938 in (2.38 mm) for woven wire screens (diagonal dimension).<BR>f. All manifold connections and seals connecting moving parts of the screen shall be no larger than the largest screen opening specified above;<BR>g. The screen shall provide a minimum of 27% open area;<BR>h. The screens shall be automatically cleaned as frequently as necessary to prevent accumulation of debris (proven cleaning technologies are preferred);<BR>i. The maximum head differential to trigger screen cleaning for intermittent type cleaning systems shall be 0.1 ft (0.03m):<BR><BR>In addition to meeting NMFS and USFWS criteria for screen performance, it is highly desirable to have the screen account for other design requirements.<BR><BR>a. The screen shall accommodate operation under variable river water level conditions: Yellowstone River water surface elevations fluctuate approximately 10 feet at the project site during the operation season; River depth at low flow is approximately 10 feet (8 feet under extreme low flow conditions);  Base elevation of the screen shall be within 1-2 feet of the river thalweg.<BR><BR>b. The screen shall accommodate  annual installation prior to the start of the irrigation season (typ. mid to late April) and removal prior to the start of winter to protect the screens from ice loadings which occur almost annually at the project site;<BR><BR>c. Tracks or channels on which the screens are raised and lowered shall be reinforced or otherwise protected from ice loading;<BR><BR>d. Use of multiple individual screen units which can be removed for maintenance while continuing operation of the other screens is preferable;<BR><BR>e. Individual screen units shall be designed and/or reinforced to withstand high debris loads without damage while maintaining continued water delivery;<BR><BR>f. Screen units shall incorporate cleaning mechanisms on both leading and trailing sides of the screen to remove debris and biological growth from the screen surfaces;<BR><BR>g. Utilization of proven screens and technologies is preferred;<BR><BR>h. Minimization of power demand is preferred due to limited power supply capacity at the existing project site;<BR><BR>i. Screen units shall be durable and reliable to reduce operation and maintenance costs to the maximum extent possible.<BR><BR>Firms are invited to provide information, specifications, brochures, manuals,  availability of  products  equal to the salient characteristics and application noted in this announcement, to include: demonstrated capabilities, product past performance and application, place of Manufacture;  part number, drawing number, etc; size, dimensions, or other form, fit or functional description; indicate foreign or domestic manufacturer,if foreign specify country of origin;  information pertaining to experience on previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed, any in-house research and development effort, and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.<BR><BR>Respondents are encouraged to submit information by mail to the address specified or via email to Wanda Carter-Davis at wanda.c.carter-davis @usace.army.mil with the Subject Line Intake Screens no later than 3p.m.(CT) on December 31,2009.  <BR><BR>Information provided will not be returned. Responses and comments will be shared with the Government project team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. Vendors must appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. Omaha District will adhere to Federal Acquisition Regulation policy on handling proprietary information. <BR><BR>This is not a Request for Proposal and no contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI. The Government reserves the right to post additional notices relative to the RFI and request additional capability statements and/or similar documentation. Please note that no registration is required nor is a bid list maintained.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost  (completion form) type contract to Integran Technologies Incorporated to conduct demonstration/validation for Environmentally Friendly Nanometal Electroplating Processes for Cadmium and Chromium Replacement.     The contractor together with its subcontractors, will increase the efficiency and lower the cost of their proprietary coating deposition process.  This will principally involve the development of low-cost 100 kW and 200 kW power supplies capable of producing direct current and low-frequency pulse and pulse reverse current.  These power supplies will then be used to demonstrate their functionality at developing and optimizing the production of nanostructured cobalt- and zinc-based coatings using an electroplating process.<BR>The work will be conducted in three phases and this contract action includes all three phases.  Phase I will involve the design and construction of a high power output, low-cost power supply with the following characteristics:  (1) maintain process critical pulse specifications under a wide range of load conditions, without a significant increase in the peak output voltage requirements for the system, (2) design and/or recommend cabling required for delivering required performance at various installations, (3) design system to be compliant with global EMC and safety standards, and (4) design system to be scaled up.  In parallel to the above work, the contractor will develop critical power supply specifications.  The contractor will determine the effect of various pulse characteristics on the deposit material properties to support the optimization of the power supply.  The contractor will design and develop a test protocol to verify functionality of the newly designed power supply and its compatibility with the nanostructured plating process.<BR>In Phase II, the contractor will use the newly developed power supply to develop and optimize electroplated coatings intended to replace the currently used electrolytic hard chromium (EHC) and cadmium coatings.  This will involve: (1) defining a deposition window of operation compatible with the power supply, (2) demonstrating that the performance of coatings deposited using the new power supply meet or exceed the performance of the existing technology through materials testing, (3) transferring the process to a production facility an demonstrating the ability to work with large components that can test the capabilities of the optimized power supply.<BR>In Phase III, the contractor will develop an additional power supply to double the operating currents from the Phase I power supply without sacrificing pulse performance.  The contractor will demonstrate that properties of coatings produced with the larger power supply are equivalent to those produced using the power supply developed in Phase I.<BR>      This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Cost type contract to Integran Technolgies, Inc. for Demonstration/Validation for Environmentally Friendly Nanometal Electroplating Processes for Cadmium and Chromium Replacement.  These services will be provided to the Strategic and Environmental and Development Research Program Office, Arlington, VA.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Nancy Hilleary at Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315.<BR>

<p>&emsp;<br />Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details]<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />All All 30 Calendar Days<br /><br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.

QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />All All 60 Calendar Days<br /><br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered unacceptable and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.<br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered unacceptable and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. Addendum: The following paragraph is tailored as follows: Para (c), Period for Acceptance of Quotes. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days for the date specified for receipt of offers. Interested parties may submit a written offer in accordance with FAR 52.212-1. Offers submitted orally will not be accepted. Your offer must include discount terms, delivery date, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS number. To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions. To register, please apply via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. Offerors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/. <br />FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. (Jan 1999) The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) DESC rating; (2) Conformance with delivery requirements; and (3) Price. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance with the DESC rating carrying significantly more weight than items 2 or 3. Only firm-fixed price offers will be evaluated. The Government will first evaluate the technical acceptability of all offers. To be acceptable and eligible for award an offer must have a DESC rating of acceptable or above. If the technically acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price is judged to have an "Outstanding" DESC rating that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the evaluations, the government will determine which proposal offers the best value as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the technically acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price has an overall "Outstanding" DESC rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>(2) If the technically acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price does not have an overall "Outstanding" DESC rating, the process will continue (in order by price) until a technically acceptable offeror is found with an overall "Outstanding" DESC rating at which point the government will conduct an integrated best value assessment of that offeror and those lower priced offerors. If no technically acceptable offeror in the competitive range has received an overall "Outstanding" DESC rating, the government will make an integrated assessment best value award decision involving all technically acceptable offerors in the competitive range. In either event, the government will award to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government."<br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. All responses that meet the criteria contained within will be considered.</p>

Solicitation No. DTRT57-10-Q-80026 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.  The NAICS Code is 334511and the Small Business size standard is 750 employees.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Order on a non-competitive basis with JVN Communications, Inc.  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase SIM Drive System Replacement (SDRR) to assist the Volpe Center in support of the Standard Automation Replacement System(STARS) and Airport Surveillance Radar Model 11(ASR-11) implementation at various US Air Force and Air National Guard bases in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

Statement of Work (SOW)  (BEGIN)

BACKGROUND:

The US Air Force (USAF) Electronic Systems Center (ESC) National Airspace System (NAS) program office has the responsibility for the DoD in the implementation of the NAS.  In order to make DoD ATC facilities interoperable with FAA ATC facilities, ESC has embarked on a long-term project to replace the DoDs terminal radars and automation systems, called DoD-NAS.  

The Volpe Center is contributing to this upgrade through engineering and installation of the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Airport Surveillance Radar model 11 (ASR-11).

One of the Volpe Centers tasks in this regard is the performing of flight tests, radar recording functions, performance analysis and system optimization at sites receiving STARS and/or the ASR-11.  Team members have been using a sole source procured system call the FAA Interfacility and Radar Simulator (FIRS) tool to perform these tasks.  In the time since the initial procurement, however, there have been advances in the capability of STARS and the ASR-11 which have not been matched by FIRS.  But, there has been a new tool, SIM Drive System Replacement (SDRR) which has kept pace with these developments.  To continue to have the ability to perform these tasks, the Volpe Center will need to acquire systems with SDRRs capabilities. 

DELIVERABLES:
1.) Provide two (2) systems with the following capabilities:

 Easy-to-use, Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based system for the recording and playback of digital radar signals
 Simulate, record, and reproduce Air Route Surveillance Radar Model 4 (ARSR-4), Airport Surveillance Radar Model 9 (ASR-9) and ASR-11 digital messages, including All-purpose Structured Eurocontrol Radar Information Exchange (ASTERIX) categories 34 and 48, Mode S, and multilateration.
 Simulate, record, and reproduce the interfacility data messages as defined in the FAAs NAS-MD-600 series of specifications.
 Create test scenarios which produce radar and interfacility data messages as time sequenced events.
 Reproduce recorded radar and interfacility data messages as time sequenced events.
 Collect test scenario data for fault replication and analysis.
 Have tool portability such that it may be carried in a single, carry-on, luggage-sized container. 

2.) Provide 1 Year Maintenance Agreement. Agreement shall allow for replacement of failed components or cases, telephonic support, and software upgrades, should they be available during the period of the agreement.

3.) One day Training:
Train 2 people (tentatively Michael Egan and Wilbur Benner) at vendors site (707 White Horse Pike, Suite B-6 at Absecon Courtyards, Absecon, NJ 08201) on differences between FIRS tool and SDRR.  Training shall include classroom training, demonstration of operation, and hands-on practice with trainer evaluation for trainees.

4.) PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The period of performance is from January 1, 2010 through April 30, 2010. 

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  (END)

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>3052.204-71 Contractor employee access.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS <br />(JUN 2006) <br />(a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: <br />(1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); <br />(2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated <br />by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); <br />(3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and <br />(4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures. <br />(b) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. <br />(c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. <br />(e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. <br />(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />ALTERNATE I <br />(JUN 2006) <br />When the contract will require contractor employees to have access to Information Technology (IT) resources, add the following paragraphs: <br />(g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS. <br />(h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract. Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any information technology resources not expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved in writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved. <br />(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). <br />(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access. <br />(k) Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department's Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted: <br />(1) The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U. S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State; <br />(2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U. S. citizen; and <br />(3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government. <br /><br />(l) Contractors shall identify in their proposals the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work under the contract. Any additions or deletions of non-U.S. citizens after contract award shall also be reported to the contracting officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Proposals shall be submitted per instructions found in Instructions to Offerors of this solicitation (FAR 52.212-1)<br /><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Government will award one contract as a result of this solicitation, but reserves the right to award no contracts, if no offers are found to be acceptable for award. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR><BR>i. Technical capability of offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; (iii) price/cost (see FAR 15.304)<BR><BR>1. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important when compared to price. <BR><BR>b. Options- The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>d. All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees using a two-phase process, conducted as follows: <BR><BR>i. Factors to be Evaluated: <BR><BR>1. Factor 1 Technical Approach<BR><BR>2. Factor 2 Past Performance<BR><BR>3. Factor 3 Price <BR><BR>ii. The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR>iii. Phase I - The non-price factors will be evaluated to support best-value trade-off process for the two non-price factors. The non-price factors will be assigned an adjective rating, and proposals with an adjective rating of acceptable or be will no be considered for award. The following adjective ratings will be assigned to the offerors technical and past performance portion of the proposal:<BR><BR><BR>1. Excellent -The prototype has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the prototype provides strengths which are supported in the written technical proposal. The technical factors are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>2. Good - The technical proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Past performance indicates little doubt that the offeror perform the required effort. <BR><BR>3. Acceptable- The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR><BR>4. Marginal - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.<BR><BR>5. Unacceptable - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record<BR><BR>iv. In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the proposals. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Economic Quantity Discount and revised pricing will be taken into consideration in Phase II. Each proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>9.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability in developing strategic identities and the ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed. Project estimates with further project cost detail are provided as tasks are required.<br /><br />For each task, estimates and a creative brief with a project plan is submitted to the client. Before works commences we obtain the approval of the COTR to the estimate and creative brief. As the project progresses, Contractor will seek notices to proceed from the COTR with each deliverable and milestone.<br /><br />Deliverables<br /><br />Contractor will design and produce a number of promotional materials, including, but not limited to: (1) designing and/or updating promotional materials, as listed above; and (2) designing and/or updating Web sites. The Government will have exclusive ownership of all deliverables produced under the resultant purchase order.<br /><br />Period of Performance<br /><br />The period of performance is for a period of 12 months from the date of award with four (4) one-year options. The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility). <br /><br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA<br /><br />In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special feature, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Library's needs, the Library shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding the Requirement/Technical Approach-(30 Points)<br /></span>Demonstrated quality, innovation, and understanding of the NLM/NIH mission and creativity.

<DESC><p>Synopsis<br />Purchase, BLU-109/B and BLU-122/B Warhead Case Test Assets &amp; Test Hardware</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron is contemplating the sole source award of a purchase order to Rand Machine Products, Inc., 2072 Allen Street Extension, Falconer, NY, 14733. It is intended that the award be made to support the on-going test and qualification of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and design enhancements to accommodate AFX-757 explosive fill in the BLU-109 and BLU-122 penetrator warheads. A&nbsp;December 2009 award is anticipated for the procurement of test hardware and two (2) BLU-109/B and Four (4) altered BLU-122/B warhead cases:<br />Two (2) BLU-109 Warhead Cases are to be configured as BLU-109C/B Case Assemblies, Empty (200827956-010).<br />Four (4) BLU-122 Warhead Cases are to be as BLU-122X/B Case Assembly, Empty ( 6X .750 Dia. Nose Holes) (X68509017-010)<br />BLU-122X/B cases will be used for testing conceptual IM improvements in accordance with MIL-STD-2105 and MIL-STD-810. The BLU-109C/B case will be used to back fill test hardware inventory. The BLU-109C/B configurations are based on the preexisting BLU-109/B case configuration with the incorporation of the following improved components: Aft Fuzeliner, Aft Fuzeliner Retainer, Charging Tube Fitting, Charging Tube Nut, Charging Tube, 9-Hole Vented Aft Closure, and Aft Closure Retaining Ring Assembly. The BLU-122X/B are base on modified BLU-122/B case configurations with the incorporation of the aforementioned improved components as well as the reduced Arming Well (steel) and Forward Vent Plugs. The procurement of the empty BLU-109 and BLU-122 warhead cases can only be met by Rand Machine Products because of their experience/qualification in the manufacturing of penetrator internal parts; in support of Elwood National Forge (JMC and Hill AFB BLU-109 sole source) and their exclusive expertise in the manufacturing of the Eutectic Closure Retainer Ring Assembly. Additionally Rand's tooling, fixtures, inspection, and machine programming further enhances it's justification as sole source for the test assets and test hardware. The aforementioned capabilities will allow deliveries in time to meet our testing schedule. Without Rand's support in this effort the Penetrator and IM program efforts would have to stop testing until a new contract is competed and a new vendor is qualified. The Government estimates that this can take one year and would adversely impact the testing schedule and overall Program Plan by an additional one year. Rand's previous manufacturing support of 685 ARSS IM/BLU-121 test asset procurements and BLU-117, BLU-109, and BLU-122 production contracts has consistently proven to be technically sound, cost effective, and timely. <br />Test hardware component parts will be used in support of IM test efforts on as needed basis. Eutectic, DELRIN, &amp; UHMWP/TIVAR nuts will be evaluated by the contractor to ascertain threat strength at elevated temperatures. BLU-109 Salt Fog Test Fixture and remaining test hardware to be used in Government IM testing on as needed basis.</p>
<p>Hardware shall be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) drawings. The contractor shall remove the hardware corresponding to those items listed above (Test Hardware Component Parts) from the Government provided BLU-109/B and BLU-122/B warhead cases and install the improved hardware components IAW Empty Case Assemblies, Empty, BLU-109C/B, BLU-122X/B, and Salt Fog Test Fixture. The contractor shall perform periodic inspections of the assemblies and the hardware it is manufacturing to ensure compliance with associated drawing(s). Inspection data shall be available for review upon request.</p>
<p>A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 12 months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below. The AAC Ombudsman is Col Arnold W Bunch, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422. The Alternate Ombudsman is Col Lawrence G Avery, Jr., (850) 882-5422. Contact Grisselle Nusimow, Contracting Officer, (850) 883-0520, e-mail grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil for further information about this procurement.</p>

<DESC>Q: Will the CTS effort take place in theater?  What portion of the CTS program will require contractor support in Iraq or Afghanistan?<BR><BR>A: It is envisioned that CTS will be more hardware oriented than services oriented. The preliminary expectation indicates that the breakout will be approximately 70% hardware and 30% services. Any geographic breakout of task orders will be based on the existing threat environment at the time of task order execution.<BR><BR>Q: Why is the effort being re-competed?  Was there any dissatisfaction with the incumbent?<BR><BR>A: The effort is not being recompeted. This is an initial buy. <BR><BR> <BR>Q: The CTS Requirements are extensive.  Is there a breakout by percentage of the effort for these activities (i.e., Satellite broadband will be 30%, Communications Baseband 40%, etc. )?  Where will the bulk of the effort be in the requirements.<BR><BR>A: This will be Delivery/Task Order dependent. The sample task will give more insight into these relationships.<BR>

 "FAA and Small Business:  Moving Into the Next Generation"
VIEW THE CONFERENCE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS BELOW. 
The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 28 - July 1, 2010, at the Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel located at 10 N. Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK  73102.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give important information on procurement opportunities such as NextGen, eFAST, ERAM, NISC, power systems, terminal field operational support, engineering development services, safety and operations support, communications flight service and weather engineering, technology transfer, airport and aircraft safety R&D, quality standards, organizational effectiveness, research partnerships, operational support, security guard services (Federal Protective Service contracts consolidation), construction, airport modernization, information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities infrastructure and security services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, architectural and training services etc. 
The FAA annually obligates more than $3 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2009, the FAA awarded 29% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 12% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 2.2% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  In Fiscal Year 2010 (for the period beginning 10/1/09 - 11/24/09), the FAA awarded 28% to small businesses, 10% to small disadvantaged businesses, 4% to women-owned businesses, and 2% to service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. 
The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding prime contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA. 
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops.

<DESC><p>September 25, 2009: CHANGE - Uploading Phase One Request for Qualifications package.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 10 announces an opportunity for the Modernization of the Thomas S. Foley U.S. Federal Courthouse in Spokane, Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website.

In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.Applicants must have an established working office within 150 mile radius of Perry Point, Maryland, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Maryland.  No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the VA Cost Estimating and A/E Evaluation Service (00CFM1B, Attention: Robert T. Smoot, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420, one (1) CD/DVD containing the complete SF 330 Part I and Part II in PDF format is required by the due date in this advertisement.
