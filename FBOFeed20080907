<DESC>This is a PRESOLICITATION NOTICE to announce the anticipated release of the solicitation for the FDA Document Control Room, on or about May 20, 2008. 

The purpose of the Document Control Room contract is to acquire services to assist various FDA centers in the drug review process of complex applications through a variety of media. The successful delivery of these objectives will enable the FDA to promote, safeguard, and enhance the public health.
 
FDA recognizes that no single small 8(a) contractor may be capable of providing the full range of goods and services called for under this contract. Therefore, FDA encourages, where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors with strong expertise. In the event the prime 8(a) contractor teams with a non-8(a) contractor it is understood that the prime 8(a) contractor must perform 51% of the requirement.

This requirement is a total small business 8(a) set-aside. The North American Industry Classification Code is 518218.

Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 & 16.5, FDA anticipates the award of single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) hybrid contract to support the Document Control Room Program. 

The solicitation will be made available on www.fbo.gov. 

Questions or comments must be submitted IN WRITING to pattricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov or leonard.grant@fda.hhs.gov . NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Thank you for your interest in the DOCUMENT CONTROL ROOM PROGRAM

This service area is a follow-on to the current Intelligence Information, Command & Control, Equipment & Enhancements (ICE2) contract.  The overall SITE Program ceiling is $6.5B. 

The purpose of the SITE contract is to satisfy the information technology (IT) requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Community, and other agencies and would allow for external ordering. The Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) recognizes that no single contractor may be capable of providing the full range of goods and services called for under this contract. Therefore, the VACA encourages, where appropriate, the teaming of contractors and vendors.

Although this solicitation is unrestricted, in order to be considered compliant with this solicitation, large business offerors shall include small businesses as team members, to include partnerships and mentor-protégé arrangements.  Small business goals will also be reportable on an annual basis to ensure goals are being met.  Past Performance will reflect the primes’ capability to meet goals and provide real opportunities for their small business partners.  Small business prime awards are envisioned as well.

Pursuant to FAR Parts 15 and 16.5, VACA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to support the SITE requirement. The Government intends to make multiple awards resulting from this solicitation via a two-step down select process to the responsible offerors whose offers, conforming to the solicitation, will be the best value to the Government. 

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled from 1000-1100 on 03 September 2008.  See attachment "INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS" for more information. 

QUESTIONS: All questions must be submitted IN WRITING to Eugene.Silas@dia.mil, no later than 12:00pm EDT, 20 August 2008. Phone calls will not be accepted.

Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of any contract. You may register at www.ccr.gov. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable federal information technology and information management laws, regulations, policies and standards at the government-wide level. These can be primarily found at or through the Federal CIO Council website at: http://www.cio.gov. 

The Draft Future Events are as follows:

•	Final RFP release by mid-October 2008
