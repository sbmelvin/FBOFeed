A/E Design Scope of Work
PROJECT 580-17-101
Renovate/Expand Emergency Room (ER) Suite At
Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center Houston, Texas


GENERAL:

The Architect/Engineer (A/E) shall furnish all professional and technical expertise to develop Schematics, pre-design preliminaries, Design Drawings, Specifications, cost estimates and Construction Contract Bid Documents to renovate as required to expand the ER treatment area, storage, and support services in the space vacated by Wound Care and Geri-Neurology clinic (approximately 3,900 square feet) on the 1st floor of B-100. The design shall include direct connection to the existing ER treatment area.

The interior design and finishes must blend with the existing facility standards. 

The A/E must be familiar with the current VA design criteria for interior design and ER.

The A/E shall provide construction period services including  as-builts,  responses to RFIs, and periodic site visits.

The A/E shall verify existing electrical loads through metering that serving the area to be renovated.

The magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $1 million and $2 million.  


PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The A/E scope must include a pre-design phase to provide three (3) optional plans with different layouts that meet project intent and budget. All plans will be presented using PowerPoint to the MEDVAMC leadership for comparison and recommendations for the Medical Center selection and approval. The space planning must address improvement of workflow based on sequence of operations. All designs must adhere to JCAHO, NFPA, VA requirements, Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center s standards, equipment s installation requirements, and life safety latest requirements.

The Architect/Engineer shall survey the area and verify existing building structure and all related systems, study adequacy of square footage for each function, analyze utility systems and structural integrity, also verify as-built drawings. Existing drawings may not be complete or fully accurate.

The completed preliminary plans shall include a detailed construction cost estimate. The A/E is responsible to design the project within available budget and provide recommendations of deduct items as alternatives.

The A/E shall thoroughly study existing drawings and building design criteria for exact implementation and coordination of all systems and components of the new renovations, and avoidance of construction conflicts. All features and systems shall conform to the existing design criteria of Building 100 which mandates runs of all utility systems, such as electrical and mechanical systems, air ducts, piping, conduits, etc., in the interstitial space only. Installations of equipment in the interstitial space are prohibited.

The VA will select the medical equipment vendor and direct the vendor to provide generic plan and requirements for selected patient lift equipment at the start of the planning process. Following schematic plan approval, the VA will authorize the medical equipment vendor to prepare site-specific installation drawings with all required data, loads, and clearances in a timely manner to allow the design process to proceed. The A/E will coordinate and incorporate these parameters and include medical equipment drawings for reference purposes as part of the Bidding Documents.

The A/E will coordinate and issue structural performance requirements as required by the medical equipment vendor. Final structural design and installation will be provided by a full-service certified unistrut company as part of the general construction contract.



DESIG N S UBMIT TALS:

After the predesign Floor Plan (15%)has been approved by the MEDVAMC, the A/E shall submit 35 percent, 75 percent, 95 percent, and final design bid packages per VA s Program Guide, PG 18-15, Volume C, A/E Submission Instruction for review and approval. The VA will respond with comments within 15 calendar days after the receipt of each submittal.

Each submission will include two complete half-size sets of Drawings, one full-size Architectural Floor Plans, and two CD-ROMs.

Final submittals shall include three half-size sets of Drawings and two CD- ROM discs for Drawings using REVIT (BIM) 2012 and AutoCAD latest version and Specifications using Microsoft Word latest version. All electronic submittals must adhere to VA requirements.

Room s square footage and dimension must be indicated on the floor Plan.

SAFETY:

The A/E will provide a performance specification for revisions to the existing sprinkler system.

The A/E will include provisions in the Specifications that the Contractor is responsible to provide sprinkler drawings and hydraulic calculations prepared by a licensed registered sprinkler contractor.

Certification of the fire protection systems will be performed by an independent third party engaged by the VA. Certification of the fire protection systems will not be part of the A/E Services.

The VA will provide the A/E with existing facility life safety plans and analysis indicating the location of smoke compartments, rated partitions, and life safety egress.

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN STANDARDS:

The A/E shall be responsible for designing to achieve sustainable design equivalencies and for implementing within the design the following Guiding Principles found in the Federal Leadership on High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding and the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual:

Employ Integrated Design Principles (Integrated Design, Commissioning)
Optimize Energy Performance (Energy Efficiency, Measurement and Verification). See attached Energy Efficiency Design Standards document.
Protect and Conserve Water (Indoor Water, Outdoor Water)
Enhance Indoor Environmental Quality (Ventilation, Thermal Comfort, Moisture Control, Day lighting, Low-Emitting Materials, and Protect IAQ during Construction)
Reduce Environmental Impact of Materials (Recycled Content, Bio- based Content, Construction Waste, Ozone Depleting Compounds)

Sustainable design features, activities and equivalencies are part of overall Federal policy to limit environmental impact and ensure the environmental compatibility of Federal facilities. It is the intent of the VA to make every reasonable and rational effort to meet these requirements. In the event the A/E concludes that implementation of specific sustainability requirements is not feasible (in that doing so creates major negative impacts on the project, including major overall cost increases, major operational feasibility issues, major technology application issues, etc.), a detailed rationale for limiting the use of the specific sustainability feature in question shall be submitted in writing to the Project Engineer for consideration. Such rationale shall include discussion of the significant negative impacts to the project. Cost comparisons and evaluations used in supporting the non-inclusion of required sustainability features must show an overwhelming life cycle rationale. Such exclusions shall not be implemented unless specifically approved by the Project Engineer.

Commissioning will be performed by an independent third party commissioning agent engaged by the VA. Commissioning will not be part of the A/E Services.
