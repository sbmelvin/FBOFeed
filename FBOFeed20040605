52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997) 

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Items No: CLIN 0001-0026; Quantity:  Various; 120 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Items No.:  CLIN 0001-0026; Quantity:  Various; 180 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)

Offerors shall also discuss how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.  

The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, as well as the following instructions:  In order to make a determination of responsibility, offerors shall submit information on their past performance in like or similar acquisitions in the last three years.  Offerors will provide no more than two pages of past performance information.  Each instance of relevant past performance shall include the contract number and/or delivery order number, contract type, contract value, whether competitive or sole source, description of work, and customer point of contact including e-mail address and telephone number.  

Offerors’ technical proposal shall be no longer than three pages; self-certification pages under 52.212-3 listed below do not count against this limit.  Offerors’ pricing data shall be no longer than two pages.  No attachments are allowed and only the front of a page shall be used.  A page that has material on back and front will count as two pages.  The contracting officer may determine proposals that deviate from these type-size and page limitations as non-responsive.  Offerors shall submit a proposal which shall be quoted in US dollars and which may be transmitted via e-mail.  Compressed (e.g., zip) or executable files (e.g., exe) are not permitted!  Offers based on Irrevocable Letters of Credit (L/C) will be considered non-responsive.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation:  (1) a price proposal in US Dollars which shows the proposed unit price for each line item, the extended total price for each line item, and the total overall price for all contract line items; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the CLINs; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractor’s Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractor’s Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor’s Registration database in order to receive payment, should they receive a Government contract award!

The following clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (FEB 2002) as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (MAY 2002), to include the following subparagraphs--FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor (AUG 1996); FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (DEC 2001); FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities with Authorities and Remedies (DEC 2001); FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (FEB 1999); FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (APR 2002); FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001); 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities (JUN 1998); FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001); FAR 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (JUL 2000); FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration (MAY 1999); FAR 52.232-36 Payment by Third Party;  FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award (AUG 1996); FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (APR 1984); DFARS 252.209-7001, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by the Government of a Terrorist Country (MAR 1998); DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor’s Registration (NOV 2001);  and De-Ba’athification of Iraqi Society, Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 1, dated 16 may 2003, Subject: De-Ba’athification of Iraqi Society and the corresponding implementation plan and delegations of authority (found at http://cpa-iraq.org).
