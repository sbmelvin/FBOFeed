Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB TN intends to award a five year sole source requirements contract to Tymar Precision, Inc., 886 Aldo Ave, Santa Clara CA 95054-2213. This requirement is for H1 and H3 arc heater components. These components are required for construction and operation of the H1 and H3 Facilities in support of hypersonic testing and reentry programs. The items to be furnished are water-cooled segments 8 to 10 inches in diameter and 0.5 inch thick, fabricated of oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) copper. These items may be requested individually or in the form of module assemblies, ready for inspection and installation.

The segments are designed to survive heating rates of 4500 Btu/ft2-sec at gas pressures of 170 atm. The segments must also withstand 1,000 psi internal cooling water pressure without deformation. The ability of the H1 and H3 arc heaters to operate at these design criteria make them unique in the world in their ability to provide hypersonic test simulation. This synopsis is approved for a sole source contract action as authorized in FAR 6.302-1 (supplies or services are considered to be available from only one source). No solicitation package will be issued. However, all interested sources may identify their interest but must provide proof of capability to provide an acceptable product by submitting an accurate description of the equipment offered and make and model numbers of the equipment.

Requirement:  Purchase of a minimum of sixty-three (63) reagent kits and a maximum of one-hundred (100) reagent kits: eight (8) seven (7) ml bottles per kit: reagent shelf life shall be a minimum of 6 months from delivery date).  

Period of Performance shall be for a Base Year of September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009 with four (4), one (1) year options.  

Justification:
 
Background:  Laboratory of Pathology performs molecular testing to assist in the diagnosis of a variety of cancers.   It is currently the only CLIA and College of American Pathology approved clinical lab within the NCI certified for performing molecular oncology testing on materials from NIH patients. Current molecular testing includes PCR assays for B and T cell clonality in lymphoproliferative diseases, identification of cancer associated viruses (e.g. EBV, HHV-8, HTLV-1,2), and the identification of cancer associated translocations (e.g., BCL-1, BCL-2, EWS-FLI-1, PAX-3-FKHR).  All tests are performed for diagnostic purposes and for Cancer Center protocol requirements. To achieve the first step toward the goal of making a diagnosis, the samples submitted must be treated to extract and purify DNA for subsequent polymerase chain reaction analyses.  

As the only CLIA and CAP certified molecular oncology laboratory in the Cancer Center, we provide support to a number of NCI principle clinical investigators. The majority of samples submitted to our laboratory for analyses are blood and bone marrow aspirates. These samples need to be handled with extreme care to insure that no nucleic acid cross contamination occurs during the DNA isolation, purification, and analyses procedures.   To facilitate this work within the NCI, reagents and an automated (robotic) nucleic acid purification system are required for this purpose.     

As a result of increased workload the molecular diagnostic service requires automated equipment dedicated for this support service.  Automation of the DNA extraction procedure will appreciably reduce work load and preparation time, and will improve quality control.   

It is the government's belief that Precision System Science USA, Inc. is the only known source manufacturing blood and bone marrow reagents (kits).   Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current experiment taking place.  All data must remain consistent.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 am ET on May 12, 2008 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive and award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov. Please reference NCI-80070-NG on all correspondence.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The Contractor will work with NCI
program staff and with NCI-sponsored clinical trial networks to develop the
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of symptom elements that are contained within
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(PRO-CTCAE).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor must be able to support the
development of an electronic-based and psychometrically-robust patient-reported
outcome version of the symptomatic adverse events (AE) to complement the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /> <br /> The resulting PRO-CTCAE will: 1) be comprehensive to capture a range of
symptoms and functioning that enhances monitoring of adverse events; 2) have
minimal burden on the patient in terms of survey length and comprehension; 3)
be adaptable for translation into multiple languages to accommodate the
diversity of patients who participate in NCI-sponsored clinical trials; 4)

complement the revised CTCAE (version 4.0); 6) meet the standards of
compatibility within the CaBIG specifications; and 7) have minimal
administrative burden for health care providers who will collect and interpret
data for reporting adverse events and for informing patient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The contract will also validate the PRO-CTCAE and demonstrate the feasibility
of integrating the system within NCI-sponsored trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br /> It is anticipated that a resulting contract will utilize a phasing approach.<br /> <br /> Phase I<br /> Identify Barriers and Ideal Conditions to Develop, Implement, and Validate the
PRO-CTCAE in Cancer Clinical Trials<br /> Develop the PRO-CTCAE assessment system fully integrated with the CTCAE
reporting system<br /> <br /> Phase II (Option)<br /> Evaluate the validity, reliability, and feasibility and clinical utility of the
new PRO-CTCAE within the NCI clinical trials network.<br /> Create Training Materials to Support the PRO-CTCAE<br /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /> <!--[endif]--></p>

period of performance on or about 9/30/2008. The contract will also contain the
FAR provisions for the consideration of the optional Phase II
task.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this
requirement in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP).<span>&nbsp; </span>This synopsis is not an RFP; an RFP is

<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) are sought to develop and test critical technologies for a low cost, obscured weather capable weapon seeker to attack moving targets. Future Navy guided weapons require increased capability to attack moving and stationary targets in all weather conditions. Adding the new asymmetric targets from the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) require flexible and low cost weapon solutions to attack these highly mobile threats. The Navy seeks low cost, innovative, and new invention technologies that will significantly improve the capabilities of existing weapon systems. The Direct Attack Seeker Head (DASH) is a demonstration of multiple low cost technologies integrated to provide enhanced capabilities. The DASH seeker shall support fire and forget operation. The use of new, low cost, high performance components now hitting the electronics market will be critical to obtain the DASH cost objective. The DASH goal will be a modular           seeker design allowing for a single production line item that can then be integrated into multiple weapon systems using adapter kits. Weapon systems that could benefit from DASH performa!  nce and cost benefits vary from Zuni, to JDAM, JSOW, JAGM, JASSM, HARM, SDB II, Harpoon, and Tomahawk. For the DASH demonstration, a 5" inch form factor based on the DSU-33 fuze will be used. This form factor would be compatible with the majority of the possible weapon integrations. The target set for DASH will be stationary and moving targets in land and maritime environments. along with environmental, launch platform, weapon integration, and operational information. Cost will be a major driver in the DASH design and tradeoffs of Cost vs. requirements will be conducted as required. This BAA includes the first area of interest for the DASH seeker, which is titled  "0/0 Sensor" (The remaining areas of interest for DASH will be solicited in a future BAA action which includes the imaging           sensor (if needed), Automatic Target Recognition, Target Trackers, Core Processor, Sensor Fusion, and Divert Algorithms). The 0/0 Sensor must be able to correctly identify targets via Automatic Targeting algorithms or be physically compatible with an imaging sensor.  Due to budget limitations, the contractor should not pursue development of either an imaging sensor or Automatic Target Algorithms.  The proposal topic area of specific interest in this BAA action is a Zero Ceiling, Zero Visibility, practically all weather sensor.  The objectives of this topic is to provide a sensor capable of detecting and tracking moving and stationary targets in obscured weather conditions at tactically significant ranges or subcomponent technologies applicable to such a sensor design. The sensor design must utilize innovative low cost components and production methods to achieve an estimated unit production cost of less than $10K in a 30,000 quantity production. Included in the sensor will be target detection and tracker algorithms. The detection/tracker algorithm will have a high probability of acquiring the target designated by the launch platform or designated by In-Flight Target Updates (IFTUs) from data link equipped weapons within two seconds to impact. The program goals/specifications are enclosed in Section 1.4 of the enclosed attachment.  A Pre-Proposal Industry Day will occur on 15 August 2007. The location will be at NAWCWD in China Lake, CA. The purpose of the Industry Day is twofold: 1. To further disseminate the government team's interests in regard to this program. 2. To provide a forum for potential partnering arrangements for interested parties. It is anticipated that the day will start with a government team presentation to all parties followed by a public question and answer session. If you plan on attending the meeting, you will need to follow the requirements found in Section 8 of the enclosed attachment.  A listing of the questions and answers discussed  by the government team during the public sessions of the Industry Day meeting will be posted as an amendment to this BAA synopsis. Please notify the Science & Technology POC listed in Section 1.5 of intent to attend so that proper security arrangements may be arranged.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation, will not be issued.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is seeking innovative solutions for enhanced capabilities for tactical-level command and control (C2).  Offerors will be asked to develop software products that address tactical-level Command and Control (C2) challenges in a service oriented architecture (SOA) environment afloat.  Offerors will be asked to propose solutions that generically use a tactical SOA for sharing information seamlessly among operational and tactical-edge users, while specifically focusing on challenges in selected Programs of Record (PoR) .  Proposed innovative solutions will enable the necessary information to be passed between the operational-level Maritime Operations Center (MOC) and tactical level nodes, to give tactical commanders awareness-of and access-to enterprise information that is relevant to assigned missions.  These information support services must be designed under the constraint that (a) many of the physical networks supporting USW are limited in bandwidth and intermittent in nature, and (b) the technical solutions will utilize a Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) environment based on NESI compliance .  Solutions offered should address one or more of the following broad thrust areas:  

1.	increased access and shared awareness of relevant data, activities, and enterprise status among tactical forces and the MOC, 
2.	automated support for synchronized planning, coordination, and execution of network enterprise resources to meet evolving mission demands, and 
3.	visualization of critical performance indicators of force capabilities needed to manage complex problem spaces

<DESC>CIO Help Desk Services Solicitation No. DOC52PAPT0801020.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), an organization with an employee base of approximately 10,000, has a requirement for Information Technology Help Desk Services for the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the USPTO.  These services are described in paragraph number 4 of the USPTOs future requirements synopsis found at the following link http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/special.htm.  These services are similar to the Help Desk support services that are currently being performed under the Facilities Management and End User Support (FMEUS) Contract Number 50PAPT201025, with Trawick and Associates.

The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four, one-year option periods with contract award projected for summer 2008.  This requirement is designated as a 100% small business set-aside, and it is anticipated that award will be made to a single vendor with significant call volume experience of at least 600 calls per day.  The NAICS Code associated with this project is 541519 Other Computer Related Services (size standard is $23M).  

The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 1, 2008 and will only be available via the Internet at the USPTO Procurement web site at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website for ALL information related to the procurement.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored, and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to HDS1020@uspto.gov.
 
The previous two (2) synopses for CIO Help Desk Tier 1 Services (under former Solicitation DOC52PAPT0801013) and CIO Help Desk Tier 2 and 3 Services (under former Solicitation DOC42PAPT0801014) posted in FedBizOpps on February 29, 2008 ARE CANCELED.   This announcement combines and replaces both of the synopses previously issued on February 29, 2008 and deletes the conflict of interest provision in the previous synopses (and paragraph 4 of the Special Notices announcement posted on the USPTO Procurement web site) which stated a vendor awarded a contract for Help Desk Tier 1 services will be barred from award of any of the following services:  Help Desk Tier 2 and 3, FM and EUS Services due to potential conflicts of interest.  ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS MAY NOW PARTICIPATE UNDER NEW SOLICITATION NO. DOC52PAPT0801020 FOR USPTO CIO HELP DESK SERVICES.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>DISA/DITCO, intends to issue a brand name contract to Biztech Solutions, 20 Gibson Place Suite 310, Freehold, NJ 07728-8483. This acquisition is for A six month follow-on contract of Keyfile Software Support (400 Users, Version Control and Optical) at Defense Commissary Agency-PMO, Hopewell,VA. Period of performance is 01 April 2008 through 30 September 2008. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304( c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (brand name). Companies who can provide the above listed software support must request a copy of the Solicitation not later than COB 7 May 2007 to the following address: jason.day@disa.mil. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered. The NAICS code is 541511 for this procurement. The following is the justification for the procurement: This requirement is for the continuity of Keyfile Software Support for sustainment of the legacy system, DDMS and to support DeCA's 400 users both CONUS and OCONUS location for 6 months pending the delivery of DERMAS. Only one responsible source has the requisite compatible service/maintenance arrangements to meet DECA's requirement. The start up time of another vendor to provide the software support is approximately 3 months, which would result in a duplication of cost. Therefore, it is not cost effective for the government to procure a new vendor startup.</p>

<DESC>Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT) & Basic Training (BT) Barracks in the Southeast Region (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN), primarily Fort Benning The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Charlotte Cramer, 817-886-1082; or by e-mail at charlotte.cramer@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.

Philippines Department of Budget and Management Financial Management Systems Technical Assistance.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to identify process improvements, system needs, and preparation of documents associated with the procurement of necessary financial management systems hardware and software.  


As the government entity responsible for promoting sound and efficient fiscal management, the Philippines Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has embarked on a multi-phase IT enhancement and modernization effort that can be broken down into phases.  Phase one began in 2005 when the Commission on Information Communication Technology provided $3 million to DBM to develop an eBudget system.  This system was implemented by a local firm, ISI-CSC, using Microsoft Technology; and is now being maintained and enhanced by another local company, Incuventure Partners Corporation.   DBM has requested additional assistance for phase two which involves the procurement of systems worth $8.75 million for expansions and modernization of the overall IT infrastructure.  Phase two will lay the groundwork for a full Integrated Management Information System (IFMIS) project, which is the third and final phase.  

To begin phase two, DBM has requested funding from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to assist in the preparation of tender documents for the procurement of the IT systems to expand their operations.  The systems upgrade will include: the eBudget system; budget preparation management system; government manpower information system; and foreign assisted projects database.  Additionally, the Technical Assistance would include a best practices international workshop where government officers and U.S. industry would share experiences with DBM in implementing financial management system projects.  The proposed Technical Assistance would represent a significant step forward in addressing the challenges faced by the Philippine Government and help bring their systems and operations in line with international best practices.    

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $274,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: 

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, JUNE 16, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
I.  DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM (MTS) TO ADVANCE THE EXISTING MARITIME INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK {Thursday, 1 May 2008}
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration intends to acquire on a Sole Source Basis the highly specialized services for the development of Marine View ( hereinafter referred to as "MarView") that are deemed to be available only from Applied Enterprise Solutions, LLC (doing business as and hereinafter referred to as "AES").  
This is being pursued on a sole source basis because the Maritime Administration believes AES is the only known source that can demonstrate the proven ability to perform successfully in all aspects of the project; AES has developed and built the entire MarView architecture and framework; AES has developed the conceptual hardware architecture for MarView; and, AES worked with the Government and vendors to procure, build and implement the physical architecture.  
In addition, AES originally developed every software build and release of MarView functionality and has performed the majority of the operation and maintenance of the MarView system.

II. OVERVIEW:  MarView is currently set to release the next iteration in May of 2008. This release and subsequent releases will be the most critical to MarView's success. The detailed requirements, complex developments coupled by the high visibility MarView has gained makes highlights the critical nature of these releases. These areas introduce significant challenges that require a contractor with extensive experience and knowledge of previously developed processes, tools, and lessons learned.  
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
III. BACKGROUND:  MarView is essentially a research-type project.  The overall objective of MarView is to provide electronic access (via portal technologies) to maritime data that is fused from numerous sources to enable better decision-making relative to the Marine Transportation System (MTS).  
The MarView Pilot was a preliminary release of functions and capabilities that currently exist within the Maritime Administration utilizing some automated facilities that have been previously developed and released on other projects.  This effort allowed end users to have a tangible sample of what MarView will provide, based on existing, well defined data sources and queries.  This version was used to communicate with stakeholders and users based on the functionality of the system, while also enabling research into technologies that can be used to easily integrated data from disparate systems and sources in a timely and cost efficient way. 
The MarView Live release is the initial fielding of the public release version of the MarView solution.  The results of the pilot, combined with the functional requirements captured and analysis of technological solutions generates the design for the MarView solution.  This design is implemented and fielded based on stakeholder driven requirements and business value delivered.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
LOW FRICTION SLIPPER MATERIAL FOR AIRCRAFT ARRESTING ENGINE COMPONENTS  

Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division
Lakehurst, NJ


This is a Request for Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  

The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking proposals from potential sources for a replacement low friction slipper material.  

As aircraft land aboard US aircraft carriers, they stop by capturing a cable with their Tail Hook and pulling the cable through a hydraulic cylinder based arresting engine.  This engine transfers the energy from the airplane into the fluid, thus bringing the airplane to a stop.  There are several components which slide along steel rails riding on low friction slippers.  In addition, there are two 20 inch pistons which ride on these slippers within their cylinders.

Currently, NAVAIR uses a graphited, fabric based, plastic-phenolic material for these slippers.  The crosshead slippers run on steel rails lubricated with lithium based grease.  The piston slippers are exposed to ethylene glycol based hydraulic fluid.  As the slippers wear, misalignment of the components occurs and hydraulic fluid leaks develop in the packing.  A further problem is with the piston slippers.  The hydraulic fluid causes them to expand slightly.  This has caused the accumulator piston to get stuck, requiring significant unscheduled maintenance to correct the problem.  

The initial component being considered is the fluid accumulator.  This is a wet/dry style accumulator with a twenty (20) inch piston, inside of a steel cylinder.  The cylinder has a minimum tensile strength of 100,000 psi and a minimum yield strength of 80,000 psi.  The inside surface of the cylinder has a 16 microinch finish.  The slippers provide the sliding surface for piston.  They are arranged equally spaced radially around both ends of the piston, twelve (12) per end.  Each slipper measures 3.5 x 2.5 x .625 inches.  One set is constantly immersed in hydraulic fluid.  The piston moves about 16 feet in three seconds, with a maximum velocity of about 130 inches per second.  The total elapsed time of an arrestment event is about three (3) seconds.  Following an arrestment, the system is reset to its original condition and made ready for another event in 30 seconds.  

Candidate slippers shall have slower wear than the current slippers, without damaging the steel cylinder.  They shall be compatible with ethylene-glycol based hydraulic fluid and lithium grease with minimal or no swelling.  They shall be dimensionally equal to the existing slippers so that no modification to other components will be required.

Candidate replacements will be technically evaluated and then tested for ease of installation, life cycle and suitability for the intended equipment.  Once a candidate is deemed acceptable, there are several other sets of slippers on the arresting engine that this solution may be acceptable for.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
HYDRAULIC CYLINDER PACKING FOR AIRCRAFT ARRESTING ENGINE COMPONENTS  

Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division
Lakehurst, NJ


This is a Request For Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  

The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking proposals from potential sources for a replacement hydraulic cylinder packing.  

As aircraft land aboard US aircraft carriers, they stop by capturing a cable with their Tail Hook and pulling the cable through a hydraulic cylinder based arresting engine.  This engine transfers the energy from the airplane into the fluid, thus bringing the airplane to a stop.  There are several hydraulic cylinders within this system that require packing to seal the high pressure fluid within the cylinders.

Currently, NAVAIR uses a Chevron style V-ring packing made of neoprene on all engine components.  The hydraulic fluid is ethylene glycol based.  If the gland is not shimmed properly, there could either be excessive drag on the piston or the gland could leak under pressure.  A self energized style of packing may be more reliable in these situations.  

The initial component being considered is called the Anchor Damper.  The piston rod diameter is 3.872 inches, the packing gland diameter is 5.000 inches and the packing length is 1.80 inches.  The maximum stroke of the piston is 192 inches.  The maximum speed is 515 inches/sec.  The peak momentary pressure is 12,500 psi, dropping to 10,000 psi.  The event duration is 3 seconds.  After each event, the system is reset and made ready for another event.  The pressure while in this ready condition is 400 psi.  When the system undergoes maintenance, the pressure will drop to zero psi.  The minimum time between events is 30 seconds.  The only requirements for any new packing is that it be compatible with the parameters above and seal under pressures from 0 thru 15,000 psi..  No  modification to existing components is being considered beyond the possible addition of spacers, if necessary.

Candidate replacements will be technically evaluated and then tested for ease of installation, life cycle and suitability for the intended equipment.  Once a candidate is deemed acceptable, there are several other sets of packing, including one that is twenty (20) inches in diameter, that this solution may be acceptable for.

All interested sources with qualified systems are encouraged to respond to this synopsis to identify their devices, the qualifications and production status no later than 16 April 2008 and should be forwarded to address above. All information should be unclassified. The government shall not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request.

Suppliers with systems that do not meet the above requirements are strongly encouraged to forward information about their systems in response to this RFI.  It is requested that information/samples be submitted NO LATER THAN 5 JUNE 2008  to Ms. Letitia Baker, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (Code 2.5.2.3.1), Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, who may be reached at (732)323-4406.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation may not necessarily result from this RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to  this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to the RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The United States and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology
 (US-VISIT)
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT (RFI/SS)
BIOMETRIC LAND EXIT SOLUTION

1.0	Purpose 
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/ Sources Sought announcement (SS) for the purpose of conducting market research.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this document.  Information obtained is for planning purposes only. 
The Government, by means of this RFI/SS, seeks to identify potential solutions, service providers and suppliers interested in participating in the design and development of the Biometric Land Exit Solution. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also requests questions and/or feedback on the draft description of business needs, on the characteristics of current facilities described in this document, as well as suggestions for concepts of operation, technologies, devices, and the broad outline of how the Government might provide the Biometric Land Exit Solution for land exit modalities by in-scope travelers at the northern and southern borders of the US.
Respondents to this RFI/SS are asked to describe what technology and/or device/s should, in their opinion, be used to capture biographic and biometric information in a notional exit process and how the recommended approach will provide solutions for the needs of this RFI/SS (see below, Section 3 - Operational Needs).  If the respondent has specific recommendations on how biographic and biometric data capture should be done with a recommended technology or product, those recommendations should be made explicit in the response to this RFI/SS.
Respondents to this RFI/SS may submit material that addresses all or part of the biographic and biometric data capture needs for any or all of the travel modalities encountered at land Ports of Entry (POEs).  Respondents should provide a clear statement of how each part of their submission addresses a specific need in this RFI/SS.  If the approach described requires specific improvements to (a) land POE/s, the respondent shall describe what is needed in sufficient detail to allow the Government to evaluate the practicality of the approach.
2.0	General and Background Information
The 9/11 Commission, Congress and DHS agree that being able to accurately document the entry and exit of non-U.S. citizens is a priority for securing our nations borders. The results of this market research will be used to inform planning for technologies, devices, processes and/or procedures that can be used to biometrically verify that a specific United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) in-scope traveler has exited from the U.S. via a land border.  In-scope (see 4.1 Solution Complexities  In-Scope Travelers) is defined as the categories of visitors to the U.S. who are subject to the processes and procedures established by the US-VISIT program.  US-VISIT entry procedures use biographic information from valid travel documents and biometric data (currently fingerprints and a digital photograph) to verify identity. 
The US-VISIT program provides biometric identification and analysis services to agencies throughout the U.S. immigration, border management, law enforcement and intelligence communities. 
US-VISITs services help other agencies (stakeholders) such as the Customs & Border Patrol (CBP), Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State (DOS), U. S. Coast Guard and others accurately identify people and assess risk.  Most international visitors experience US-VISIT biometric proceduresthe collection of digital fingerprints and a photographwhenever they apply for visas at embassies or consulates abroad and when they enter the United States through air, sea and land border ports of entry. In each case, a visitors fingerprints are checked against a database of known and suspected terrorists, criminals and immigration violators. U.S. consular officers and CBP officers use the results from this check to make visa issuance and admission decisions. On November 29, 2007, DHS began replacing the two-fingerprint scanners with new 10-fingerprint scanners at U.S. ports of entry to collect additional fingerprints from international visitors.
The US-VISIT Program deploys identification and verification capabilities at air, sea and land Ports of Entry (POEs) that improve the integrity of the immigration and border management system while also mitigating the amount of time needed to process in-scope travelers.  Functionality developed by the US-VISIT Program has been implemented in phased roll-outs called Increments.  Increments 1, 2 and 3 have provided the capability to obtain quick, secure, and biometrically verified identities in the air, sea and land border environments.  These capabilities are used to assure that certain categories of aliens who travel to the United States are here legally, that the documents presented are legal documents within their valid period, and that the bearer of a valid travel document is the person to whom the document was issued.  
The biometric exit capability that is the subject of this RFI/SS might use the same information currently gathered by US-VISIT, but respondents to this RFI/SS are invited to suggest other approaches for establishing identity and verifying the identity with highly accurate and difficult to falsify biometric data.  Because DHS already provides biometric (fingerprint) matching capabilities and much associated Department of Homeland Security (DHS) infrastructure has been deployed to acquire, transmit, match, and provide the results of fingerprint matching, the respondents to this RFI/SS are asked to use these capabilities where they are relevant.  However, DHS appreciates that other modalities may emerge in responses to this RFI/SS that also require a centralized matching capability (i.e., biometric matching on modalities other than fingerprints).  In these cases, the respondent should structure their response to use existing capabilities, including additional capabilities for the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) managed by US-VISIT, and describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods used currently.  However, if the response does not require a centralized biometric matching capability, the respondent should describe how biometric verification of identity would occur in a manner that minimizes the opportunity for fraudulent use of documents, credentials, devices, or other means to establish identity and should also describe how and why the suggested approach would be an improvement over the fingerprint methods used currently.
The entry process at land Ports of Entry accommodates in-scope pedestrians, or in-scope travelers in personal autos, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, or similar conveyances, or in-scope travelers in/on commercial vehicles, including buses, trains, boats, ferries, or other surface transport conveyances.  These modes of travel are referred to as land entry and exit modalities.  In-scope travelers include people who intend to arrive or actually do arrive at U.S. ports for any purpose that involves applying for entry to the United States.  If the non-US citizen traveler is subject to US-VISIT procedures on entry to the U.S., that traveler will likely also be subject to US-VISIT procedures to be established for exit from the U.S.
For entry to the United States, US-VISIT in-scope travelers must carry and present appropriate travel documents (e.g., a valid passport and visa, if required) and possibly other documents (e.g., Arrival Departure Record Customs Border Patrol (CBP) Form I -94, for Non-immigrant Visitors with a visa for the United States(Form I-94).  Each US-VISIT in scope traveler is required to provide biometrics - digital fingerprints and photograph - during the entry inspection process.  Standards for fingerprints and photographs are available at www.biometrics.gov/Standards.  In contrast to the entry process, other than a pilot testing program, see, e.g., 8 C.F.R. 215.8, no such formal biometric procedures have yet been required for in-scope travelers exiting the United States.  
This RFI/SS seeks ideas, approaches, processes, technologies, devices, and/or operational models for implementing an automated, biometrically verified exit capability that interfaces to and interoperates with other government networks, services, and databases that are also used for US-VISIT entry procedures.  Specifically, US-VISIT has provided the means to collect specified biographic and biometric information from in-scope travelers as they enter the U.S. in order to verify identity and provide information used to decide the legal basis for entry into the U.S.  Biometric verification applies to non U.S. citizens (i.e., persons who exit the U.S. and are within the applicable categories of  in-scope travelers who are subject to US-VISIT requirements).  Generally speaking, US-VISIT currently applies to all visitors (with limited exemptions) holding non-immigrant visas and to visitors from visa waiver countries, regardless of country of origin.  The biographic and biometric information collected is used by DHS to verify identity, implement screening procedures, and execute the responsibilities it has to operate a comprehensive immigration program.  
As part of the systems and capabilities used to establish and verify the identity of an in scope traveler and record entry and exit information, US-VISIT operates two systems:  IDENT is a secure biometric matching system that uses fingerprints and may be extended in the future to use other biometric modalities to verify identity and to identify persons when a verification attempt cannot be confirmed.  IDENT includes information collected by DHS as well as from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), ICE, deported felons and sexual registrants, and DHS information on previous criminal histories and previous IDENT enrollments.  A separate system, the Arrival-Departure Information System (ADIS), is used to securely store non U.S. citizen entry and exit data received from air and sea carrier entry and exit manifests and land entry.  Other systems also support or are connected to IDENT, including the FBIs Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), the Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), the Computer Linked Application Information System (CLAIMS), the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), the Consolidated Consular Database (CCD), the Global Enrollment System (GES), the U.S. Coast Guards Mona Pass Proof of Concept mobile biometrics capability, and others.  
As a general rule, US-VISIT prefers open systems, standards-based data collection and data messaging formats, and commercially-available readily interoperable technology, so that installation, operation, maintenance, and communications are based on accepted, widely deployed and proven technology solutions.  While products and technologies that do not attain all of these goals will be considered, US-VISIT requires that the respondents to this RFI/SS clearly describe and detail any non-standard, not-open, and/or proprietary aspects of their response to this RFI/SS, so that the Government can develop an accurate understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the response.
The current exit procedure in effect at air, sea and land ports is specifically, all international in-scope travelers who received a Form I-94 upon arrival must still return it to an airline or ship representative when departing the United States or deposit the Form I-94 into a designated receptacle if exiting the U.S. by means of one of the land travel modalities.  DHS will publish proposed air and sea biometric exit requirements and plans to deploy an air and sea port biometric verification of identity solution for exit 2009.  This RFI/SS is to support a similar biometric verification of identity for in-scope travelers as they exit the U.S. at a land port.
Legal entry to the United States occurs at specific POEs.  Land POEs are defined as those that accommodate pedestrian, vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses, motorcycles, bicycles and other conveyances, or other facilities or processes that accommodate travel by train, boat, or ferry for entry into the U.S.  Each POE also accommodates exit from the U.S.  In-scope travelers who enter the U.S. via one mode may exit via any other mode.  The primary goal is to implement the mandated biometrically verified Land Exit process with the minimum impact on travel time and processing; cost and impact on traffic; surrounding environment and communities; and expense and inconvenience to the traveler.  
US-VISIT is seeking information to help implement the collection of biographic and biometric data from in-scope travelers as they exit from the U.S. by any of the land modalities that were noted earlier in this RFI/SS.  All such collection capabilities must interface to and interoperate with all existing DHS networks, infrastructure, and systems as necessary to maintain the integrity of the departments border and immigration management system. This RFI/SS requests that responses focus on the sensing/recording/input technology, devices, and/or operational and technical processes to be used at a land exit part of a POE only.
Because of the unique challenges of deploying a biometric exit identity verification solution in the land border environment, especially for multiple occupants of vehicles, land border biometric exit is being addressed separately from air and sea. Note that, for practical reasons, biometric identity verification is established by matching valid travel document(s) with biographic information and a biometric image or scan that agree with existing entries in DHS records.  This RFI/SS requests that industry consider and provide suggestions to satisfy the functional needs and desired properties of biometric identity verification for Land Exit capability or technologies applicable to all land modes of travel.  
3.0 Operational Needs
The following presents a combination of characteristics that outlines the solution space for a Land Exit system, processes, components and applicable technology. The Land Exit solution is envisioned to be a combination of processes and technology specifically adapted to the land exit environment, its in-scope travelers, and, as required, system operators.  Land exit may encompass multiple technologies each of which is superior in meeting a particular aspect of the Land Exit solution. This section presents operational needs as constraints, complexities, qualities, and processes that US-VISIT anticipates that the Land Exit solution will have to address and possess, as well as attain the following goals: 
	Provide automated capture of an in-scope travelers biographic and biometric information with limited traveler intrusiveness, safety and throughput delays.      
	Biometrically verify the identity manifested by biographic information on legal documents that are presented as part of the exit process.
The following bullets describe steps in a notional exit process that would be executed by existing DHS capabilities:
	Transmit the biographic and biometric data collected at a port for an exiting in-scope traveler to DHS systems for biometric verification of the identity
	Perform biometric match operations
	Record an in-scope travelers departure from the U.S. in the existing ADIS system
	Match the exit record to the travelers entry record in the existing ADIS system
Any or all of the above may be addressed by the response to the RFI/SS as appropriate to make the solution suggested by the respondent work, or work in a way that improves the value to the Government and/or the traveler.
In all cases, the response should maintain or enhance the following overall US-VISIT goals:
	Enhances the security of our citizens and visitors 
	Facilitates legitimate travel and trade 
	Ensures the integrity of our immigration system 
	Protects the privacy of our visitors 
3.1 Constraints
Statute, DHS policy, or practical considerations impose the following constraints on, and preferences for, the Land Exit solution:
	All data collection, usage, and storage related to Land Exit must comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, international treaties, and DHS Departmental guidance on privacy and security.
	Land Exit physical infrastructure improvements and construction must comply with applicable environmental statutes and regulations.
	Biometric technologies must follow applicable biometric standards as documented at www.biometrics.gov/Standards.
	The Government prefers a Land Exit solution(s) that applies to all existing land POEs on the northern and southern borders of the US, but it will consider responses that describe potential solutions that are applicable to a subset of the land POEs.
	Biographic and biometric data shall be collected at the time and place of exit from the U.S. or at a time and place that is, for practical purposes, virtually at the place of actual exit, such as a roadway or pedestrian facility leading to the actual border crossing point.
4.0 Solution Complexities
Complexities are circumstances or facts that make the identification of a solution difficult and drive the Governments desire for an innovative solution. The following are key complexities.
4.1 In-Scope Travelers
In - scope travelers are:
	Overall only a small percentage of travelers  out of the approximately 350 million land border entrants to the U.S. yearly, only about 3 percent are subject to US-VISIT procedures and data collection.  Presumably, about the same number of travelers who enter via land ports will exit via land ports.
	In-scope travelers are mixed with the out-of-scope travelers
	A single vehicle may contain both in-scope and out-of-scope persons, and biometric exit procedures will apply only to the in-scope travelers.
In -scope travelers can cross at a land POE as:
	Pedestrians, 
	Operators of private vehicles, to include cars, trucks, buses, motor cycles, bicycles, and similar conveyances, or commercial vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, trains, ferries, boats, ambulances, bicycles or motorcycles, or similar conveyances
	Passengers in either private or commercial conveyances
In-scope travelers present multiple travel profiles:
	Frequent travelers
	Infrequent travelers
	One time/infrequent travelers 
	Traveler who may enter at one port and leave from another, including air, sea or land ports
4.2 Facilities
There are 167 land Port of Entry facilities. Each land POE has some kind of exit infrastructure that may be as simple as a road, pedestrian path, or simple gate, or may have improvements that provide inspection booths, other structures, road modifications, more elaborate gating structures, or other controls.  However, the physical characteristics of POEs vary widely and may be no more than the roadway that crosses the border, a pedestrian path, or may be an improved facility which may or may not include specific arrangements to accommodate exit processing.  These facilities present a variety of complexities. Some of these complexities are:
	Some POEs are extremely limited on the extent of physical changes that could be introduced due to a variety of considerations ranging from existing infrastructure that may or may not be owned or leased by the U.S. Government; historic sites and environmental considerations; weather and geographic constraints in land use; lack of utilities and/or communications; and a number of like considerations.          
	POE designs vary from large scale, complex facilities to simple almost rustic remote buildings.
	POEs may be 24 hour/7 days per week operations while others may have defined operating hours and procedures.
	POE operations and procedures are often driven by the physical layout of the POE. For example, some pedestrian exit areas have controlled turnstiles, while others have open uncontrolled outdoor areas for pedestrian exit; some vehicle exit lanes are at speed and others lead into toll-booth areas that are, currently, not used to conduct routine exit operations.
The facilities for exit capabilities are varied. Some POEs have infrastructure such that   collecting a biometric at departure is manageable.  For example, extended power communications; installed roads or structures; gate houses, turnstiles, and/or in-lane vehicle inspection booths; utilities, HVAC, high-speed data communications, space for sensitive equipment, and sheltered areas for inspections.   
Other POEs may not provide the infrastructure listed above. Further more, border crossings may be adjacent to each other or only separated from each other by distances of only a few feet.   
This RFI includes in-scope travelers who exit by ferry or rail crossings because they are categorized with land crossings, distinct from the Cruise Line Industry.  
4.3 Desired Qualities and Values
It is requested that Industry identify potential technologies, devices, processes and/or procedures that can provide all or parts of the biometrically verified data collection system for any or all of the 167 land Ports of Entry/Exit.  The following qualities are desired:
	Safe:	the solution imposes no potential health risks to the traveler or Inspector (if required in the context of the response), either through the use of the potential solution or an individuals proximity to the devices associated with the potential solution and does not interfere with the duties of any operator or Inspections Officer in a manner that imposes a threat to the safety of the operator or Officer.	
	Secure: the solution prevents unauthorized duplication, alteration or otherwise fraudulent use of devices or tokens that interfere with the intended use of the solution to biometrically verify the identity of in-scope travelers; the data associated with the solution is captured and transmitted in a manner that it can not be intercepted or used in a way other than as intended; and the data and use of the data is structured to protect the privacy of the traveler.
	Unobtrusive: the solution minimizes the actions (if any) by the traveler in the biometric collection process.	
	Accurate:  a minimum of 100% correct biometric identification and verification of legally exiting in-scope travelers with no collection of data from out-of-scope persons.
	Durable: built to withstand long periods of use, environmental exposure, both large and small volume use, resistance to mechanical damage due to dropping, misuse, moisture, etc.
	Easily used by the traveler and operator, if an operator is required.
	Compatible (or non-interfering with) with the existing port environment, to the maximum extent possible, including other technologies, such as those used for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), U.S. Canada Border Crossing Initiative (NEXUS), and Free and Secure Trade (FAST), radiation portal monitors, license plate readers, or other screening devices.
	Comprehensive:  applies with minimum adaptation to the population of in-scope travelers exiting the U.S.
	Has minimum impact on traffic flow.
	Has minimum cost to the Government and to in-scope travelers, in terms of initial, operating and maintenance costs, and in time or effort for in-scope travelers spent in the Exit process.
	Has low environmental and social impact (e.g., does not increase or render objectionable traffic patterns, nor impact on historic sites, nor compromise privacy) on in-scope travelers or surrounding communities. 
	Provides a scalable solution/technology that can be used at both high volume Ports of Exit as well as smaller, less well developed and less frequently used ports.  However, this is not to be construed to discourage responses that provide a solution that is best for specific ports or situations.
	Accommodates full-scope training and testing to assure that personnel can operate the equipment/technology/process/procedure quickly, competently, safely and are able to obtain the intended results.
The Government prefers but does not require a solution that is as open, compatible, and interoperable with industry standard equipment and existing DHS biometric verification capabilities, including interfaces, protocols, and practices.  The Government will evaluate responses in this light.  It is generally understood that openness, compatibility and interoperability mean that hardware and software easily attach to and work with commercial off-the-shelf products from other vendors without need for custom hardware or software adaptors.  Software drivers that are otherwise fully compatible with operating systems, computer hardware, and communications equipment in general use in DHS systems are considered interoperable.  Respondents are requested to highlight not-open, not-compatible, and not-interoperable aspects of their responses.
5.0 Specific Needs
The following information is provided to stimulate industry responses on how these needs might be satisfied.  While many of these needs are stated in a shall format (suggestive of a mandatory requirement), for purposes of this RFI/SS, industry is requested to respond with all appropriate or useful information, even if the information suggests an alternative requirement or standard or suggests reconsideration of the requirement as articulated herein:
1.	Self identification by individuals to determine whether the traveler is in-scope may not be sufficiently reliable.  Some assistance, indication, or screening step may be necessary to reliably and accurately apply US-VISIT processing to the category of in-scope travelers.
2.	Processes, procedures, technology, or some combination of these that will enable two Objectives:
a.	Rapid identification of in-scope travelers who are in-scope for US-VISIT processing.
b.	Rapid biometric verification of the identity of in-scope travelers; usually accomplished by evaluation of the validity of (a) travel document(s) and use of a biometric modality to verify the identity that is asserted by the document.  For example, biometric identity verification is done at entry by using an optical scanner to scan the machine-readable-zone (MRZ) of a valid travel document and use of finger-scans to determine whether the fingerprints of the person bearing the documents match the fingerprints of the identity on file in IDENT.
3.	The Land Exit potential solution shall be applicable to and effective with all current and anticipated categories of exiting in-scope travelers within US-VISIT scope.
4.	The Land Exit potential solution should be compatible across exit modalities; as a minimum, the potential solution should not interfere with devices, technologies, processes, etc. in use for other modalities. 
5.	US-VISIT is committed to facilitate legitimate travel and trade; accordingly, the time needed to get a usable biographic and biometric data from a traveler shall be as short as possible while also assuring that biometric verification of identity is at least 97 percent accurate.  Technical, process, or procedural add-ons must not cause excessive queuing or congestion at Ports of Exit.
6.	The technology described by the respondent for biometric verification of identity should not result in a false positive verification more than 0.1 percent of the time. 
7.	The biometric verification of identity should not result in a false negative verification more than 0.1 percent of the time.  
8.	Methods and mechanisms for reporting results of identity verification both to individual Ports and to DHS shall be defined in the context of the respondents solution.
5.1 Inputs and Outputs
These are the key inputs and output that the Land Exit solution needs to provide.
	INPUT:  Capture biographic and biometric data from the in-scope traveler at exit from the U.S., regardless of the land mode of travel and with as little interference with or delay of travel as possible.
	INPUT:  Accurate collection of biometric information from in-scope travelers as they exit through a land POE.
	OUTPUT:  Verification or failure to verify that the biographic and biometric data presented by the traveler at the POE match with the associated DHS records.
6.0 Response Guidelines
Respondents to this RFI/SS are required to provide information describing the suggested solution, technologies or products that are included in the solution, and the biometric matching processes included in the solution.  Note that if the respondents solution is based on fingerprints, IDENT in its current form will provide the matching capability needed to verify identity.  If some other biometric modality is part of the solution described, the relevant matching capability would, presumably, be added to IDENT.  The respondent should describe their intent in this regard.  
As noted elsewhere in this document, the respondents are to assume that the Government already has capabilities for storing data that associates biometric data with biographic data, network capabilities within the POE and across DHS, and basic physical infrastructure (e.g. power, communications, buildings).  However, the respondent should note special needs and facilities to accommodate their solution, especially in the context of less well developed ports and better developed ports where exit areas may be located adjacent to but many yards from the entry facility.
The narrative of the description of the suggested solution should also outline how the biometric characteristic will be used for comparison at exit to biometrically verify the identity of the traveler.  The narrative description should also describe how the suggested technology will capture or interoperate with biographic information to be collected at exit.
6.1 Technologies and Products
Descriptive material shall be provided for each product or technology suggested by the respondent for the potential/suggested solution, including devices for initial biometric capture as the traveler enters the U.S., capture of biometric information as the traveler exits through a land POE, or comparison of biometric exit data against stored data for identity verification, and any other equipment required to enable the suggested solution. The description should include:
-	operational parameters, such as the distance from which biometric data can be captured, whether the biometric sample can be captured while the subject is moving, and environmental considerations such as temperature, precipitation, dust, dirt, and illumination requirements
-	performance parameters, such as biometric read rates (how long does data capture take, how many in-scope travelers can be processed simultaneously), factors that impact performance (such as heat, humidity, or physical barriers between the reader and the traveler), and sources of capture or comparison errors,
-	test reports or results that demonstrate how the performance parameters were calculated,
-	equipment specifications, such as size, power, communication and location requirements (e.g., outside and unprotected, office environment, computer room controlled conditions),
-	description of the maturity of the devices (e.g. are these devices currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the conceptual or design stage),
-	Operations and maintenance requirements that would have an impact on large scale deployments to the full range of ports described in this RFI/SS.
6.2 Biometric Matching Processes
US-VISIT currently utilizes fingerprints as the biometric modality for verifying traveler identity, and thus has extensive knowledge and existing capability in this area.  IDENT, the system that provides the DHS biometric identity service, also is capable of extensions for matching on multiple biometric modalities.  If the suggested solution includes the use of biometric data other than fingerprints, the respondent shall provide information to address the following:
-	Content of biometric data stored (e.g. image or mathematical representation of data)
-	Approach for comparison of biometric data
-	Uniqueness of biometrics captured (e.g., provide the probability that two individuals will have biometric data that are identical in a population of several hundred million, as will be contained eventually in IDENT for fingerprints)
-	Results provided for a comparison of biometric data (e.g. is there an absolute match/no match result, or is there a list provided of potential matches?)
-	Approach to resolution if automated equipment can not confirm if there is a complete match between the data captured at exit and the stored biometric data for a single individual
-	The algorithm that is used for the basis of comparison (e.g., is the matching based on a proprietary matching algorithm, or published biometric standards?)
-	Description of the maturity of the biometric matching process (i.e., is the suggested matching process currently in use in an operational environment, in testing, or in the design stage?)
-	Compliance with relevant capture, data formatting, compression, communication, and other standards per the information available via the www.biometrics.gov/Standards Web page.
7.0 General Guidance for Submittal
The Government requests that respondents confine their response to the information requested below; elaborate bindings, illustrations, brochures, company descriptions, past experience, and other material that speaks to qualifications to perform work are not desired.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshals Service (USMS), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  Currently, no solicitation is available.  This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps.  All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

On March 23, 2005, OFDT awarded an Intergovernmental Agreement IGA ODT-I-5-0001, between OFDT and the County of Bernalillo, 415 Roma, NW, Albuquerque,  New Mexico  87102, for housing Federal detainees at the Regional Correctional Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.  OFDT is considering terminating the IGA and awarding a contract to the County of Bernalillo for a period of not less than 10 years, however, not more than 20 years.  OFDT considers these services available only from the original source which is for the continued provision of highly specialized detention services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The anticipated scope of services to be provided and their respective functional areas are detailed below: 

OFDT is in search of existing detention facility located within the geographic boundaries of Albuquerque, New Mexico with a capacity of not less than 800 beds to house persons in custody of USMS with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on their immigration status, or deportation.  Also, on occasion, to house Federal Bureau of Prisons and USMS Short-Term Sentence (STS) prisoners from the Southwest Border Districts, and possibly, Justice Prisoner Alien Transportation STS overflows.  The requirement will include secure transportation services from the facility throughout the Southwest Border.

Construction of a new facility is not a consideration for this request.

Other Interested parties having the required physical plant to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement to include the following: (1) Name and address of firm; (2) Size of business; (3) Average annual revenue for past three years; (4) Number of employees; (5) Ownership of firm; (6) Business size (large, small, disadvantage); (7) Number of years in business; (8) Affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor if potential sub, subcontractors if potential prime; and (9) List of customers cover past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contact with address and phone number).

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.  All responses shall be submitted to Deborah M. Johnson no later than May 22, 2008.

<DESC>This announcement is a request forinformation. The Space and NavalWarfare Systems Center, San Diego(SSC San Diego), is conducting aRequest for Information (RFI) todetermine availability of ForeignComparative Test (FCT) commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) UnmannedSystem Integration Suite.The software suite will be used tointegrate sensors and vehicles into aSystems-of-Systems concept.  Thetarget cost savings for use of the suiteis a 25% reduction of engineeringcosts, either utilizing less expensiveengineering labor or reducing theamount of time required to integratesensors and systems.The suite should address the concernsof managing multiple differentrepresentations of information and theissues of incompatible programminglanguages, operating systems,hardware architectures, and networktopologies within a system and systemof systems framework. The suiteshould allow the developer to specifywhat information can be broadcast,listened to, and how, for allcomponents used in a system, supportmultiple incompatible specificationssimultaneously, be invisible to theapplication developer and end user,and allow a standards-compliantinterface to be available withoutrequiring that the contributingcomponents match the existing JAUSor STANAG standard.Anticipated cost savings goals of thesuite are to reduce training for newdevelopers, reduce critical staffingrequirements, reduce the need for onsite service, and increase flexibility ofcurrent and future systems.  Thesystem should enable true Plug andPlay functionality amongst sensorsand systems and support rapidprototyping of new sensors andsystems.Vendors may be invited to participateat their own cost at this comparativetest.  Respondents should provide as aminimum: (1) functional description(i.e. design drawings, information flow)of the software being offered; (2)performance description andspecifications of the item, and anyanticipated changes (3) if possible,include present cost of item, andanticipated cost in the future withfurther development, and anyanticipated changes; (4) if not yet inproduction, provide the developmentstatus and anticipated schedule forcompletion. Candidate systems mustbe mature, available for procurement,and demonstrated to be operationallysuitable in relevant engineeringenvironments. They should also beavailable for initial operational use nolater than one year from test date.The requested information is forplanning purposes, and does notconstitute a commitment, implied orotherwise, that a procurement actionwill be issued. However, SSC San Diegowill utilize the information for technicaland acquisition planning. It isrecognized that cost informationprovided by the contractor is apreliminary estimate for planningpurposes; the contractor will not bebound to these estimates. Subsequentacquisitions may follow in the ways tobest meet SSC San Diego needs. Thegovernment invites comments relatedto possible purchase or acquisitionstrategies. If there is a GSA or othercontract vehicle already available forthe technology being proposed, pleaseinclude this information in theresponse. All data received in responseto this RFI marked or designated ascorporate, or proprietary will be fullyprotected from release outside thegovernment. It is not the intent of SSCSan Diego to reimburse providers forthe cost of submitting information inresponse to this RFI.Please direct any questions to the SSCSan Diego POC, Mr. Chris Mailey at e-mail chris.mailey@navy.mil. To bebeneficial, interested parties shouldsubmit any applicable information by30 May 2008, via electronictransmission by utilizing the SubmitCompany Info link above.

<DESC>Description:
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only!

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) currently is establishing an online retail bookstore for its Publication and Information Sales (P&IS) program using modules from Oracle Corporation. The modules include, but are not limited, to Oracle inventory and order management modules, iPayment, and iStore. In addition, GPO intends to utilize Oracles OnDemand hosting center in Austin, TX. 
 
GPO is requesting an industry assessment of our documentation and that the vendor community provide capability statements detailing experiences with implementation of the iPayment, iStore and other Oracle inventory and order management modules, overall retail experience, and experience working with the Federal Enterprise Application Suite in the Oracle OnDemand environment. This information will be used to revise, if necessary, our documentation so as to implement a system beginning in the first quarter of the 2009 fiscal year. 

Background:
Today, P&IS manages inventory, performs order fulfillment, processes payments, submits invoices, and supports financial management with existing systems and processes.  P&IS system applications support two operations  Main GPO and Pueblo.  Main GPO primarily focuses on the GPO Sales Program, but also fulfills consigned subscriptions for Federal agencies.  Main GPO includes Headquarters, the Laurel Warehouse, the Bookstore, and the Contact Center.  The Pueblo operation primarily focuses on consignment/reimbursable sales from Federal agencies and also stores inventory and fulfills orders for the GPO Sales Program.  
2             Objectives
The objective of the current systems is to support all GPO Sales and Reimbursable programs with order processing and fulfillment.
1.3          Scope
The scope of the proposed P&IS systems includes all applications and major system components that support both Pueblo and Main GPO operations.  These operations focus on the following:
	Acquisition.  The process by which the GPO makes Federal publications available for purchase through the Superintendent of Documents.
	Marketing.  Assessing customer purchasing patterns for the purpose of suggestive selling, promotional packaging, and discounting.
	Inventory.  The storage and monitoring of publications (sales, consigned-agent, reimbursable, and by-law), including warehouse functions such as inventory movement, auditing, and re-supply. 
	Sales.  The placement of orders by customers and/or third-party vendors.  
	Customer History.  The preservation of customer profiles, including purchases, payment history, and order status. 
	Publications.  Books, maps, serials, videos, CD-ROMs, and subscriptions provided through the Superintendent of Documents or other Federal agencies.
	Item History.  The preservation of publication purchase transactions, including purchaser, sales price, and cost.
	Subscriptions.  A series of publications or periodicals distributed either regularly (monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, etc.) or irregularly (P&IS is advised when new items are available).
	Standing Orders.  Publication orders by which the customer automatically receives updated or new versions when they are published.
	Shipping.  The fulfillment of orders, which includes publication packaging (commonly referred to as picking and packing) and shipment.

Opportunity:
GPO is interested in hiring a vendor to implement the iPayment, iStore and/or other Oracle retail inventory and order management modules in an emerging Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) activity. This implementation is anticipated to take place inside the Federal Zone at Oracles OnDemand Data Center in Austin, TX. The timeframe for implementation anticipates that a large portion of the applications will be operational and live by the end of the first quarter of the 2009 fiscal year.
Background Material
Additional background material is available by contacting the Office of Programs, Strategy and Technology (int@gpo.gov).  It is strongly encouraged that anyone interested in this opportunity be familiar with the following documents:
	P&IS Concept of Operations - The document which provides a high-level conceptual vision. 
	P&IS Requirements Document - The document which identifies user requirements. 

Requested Information:
Keeping P&IS goals in mind, please outline how your organization would implement iPayment and iStore and how your organizations experience with these modules and the Federal Zone at OnDemand will ensure successful implementation in the given timeframes.
 
Vendors are hereby requested to submit a capability statement (10 pages or less and no marketing material) that addresses their ability to perform the implementation of  iPayment, iStore and other Oracle retail inventory and order management modules, working with the Federal Enterprise Application Suite in the Oracle OnDemand environment.

<DESC>NAICS CODE 336413  The Government held an industry brief at the Hope Hotel Conference Center, Area A, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on Friday, 18 April 2008. The purpose of this brief was to provide an overview of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program and its Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) stage, and to specifically highlight the framework of the embedded LRIP Source Familiarization Phase (SFP). Because the governments acquisition strategy has not been finalized, this briefing was for informational purposes only and was not an open forum for questions and answers.  A copy of the briefing is attached.  All questions pertaining to SFP or the briefing were due in writing to the government's point of contact 25 April 2008.  All industry questions received and the resulting government answers can be viewed via the attached Q&A document. The governments point of contact is Maj Shane Watson, (937) 656-9690, Michael.watson@wpafb.af.mil. As stated in our previous notification on PIXS, 29 Feb 08, target release date for our draft request for proposal (RFP) is scheduled for June 2008.  A Pre-Solicitation Conference will be conducted in the July/August 2008 timeframe.  At that time industry feedback will be solicited on Performance Requirements and the Draft RFP.

The period of the BOA is for five years (3 basic and 2 one-year options).   The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement through any other source.  This synopsis is issued to advertise the options and requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a twelve-month period.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Request for Information
Program: 60mm Direct Lay Pointing SystemCategory: Legacy SustainmentPM Office: PM MortarsARDEC Office: Mortars and Common Fire Control
This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicitated under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information.
Purpose: The government would like to query industry for technological solutions and expertise to address the need to improve accuracy when using the U.S. 60mm mortar in handheld, direct-lay mode.
Overview: Handheld Direct Lay mode is the method of engagement utilized when a target objective is in close visual proximity of the mortar and it is necessary for rapid engagement. The gunner kneels directly behind the barrel, supporting the tube with one hand and holding the trigger with the other. An assistant gunner preps the round and inserts it into the tube. The gunner lays the weapon using the range indicator assembly and sights over the muzzle for azimuth before trigger firing the weapon.
The current range indicator assembly utilizes a simple slip indicator in which a ball moves up and down in a vial as the mortar is elevated and de-elevated. There are reference markings along the slip indicator which indicate to the gunner the approximate distance his rounds will impact based on the elevation the tube is being held at. The drawbacks of the current system are: the use of tritium, inability to upgrade/update with new mortar ammunition, and the location of the range indicator which does not allow a soldier/marine to simultaneously determine range and azimuth.
Objective:
The Direct Lay Pointing System (DLP) is envisioned as a replacement for the existing range indicator system currently employed on the 60mm mortar. The primary objectives are to improve accuracy, provide multiple round capability, and the ability of the soldier or marine to use the system while maintaining alignment on target.
Key Parameters:
	The DLP should be small, rugged, lightweight, and cost-effective.	The DLP should be able to determine impact distance for a variety of mortar rounds and charges based upon the inclination of the mortar tube.	The DLP should be mountable on a U.S. 60mm mortar system in such a manner it the gunner can determine his range while maintaining alignment on target.	The DLP must be able to meet all MIL-810F environmental standards as well as survive under the standard operational conditions of a U.S. 60mm mortar. (E.G. high shock, high temperature environment)	The DLP should be day/night readable.
RFI responses will be accepted in electronic submission.  All proprietary and restricted information provided in response to this synopsis should be clearly marked.  Responses should indicate if the vendor is a large or small business.  Please ensure you have included your e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number in the body of the response.  All responses shall be in the Englishh language.  Responses must be submitted to Marcus Edmundson at Marcus.Edmundson@us.army.mil.  Responses are due on or before May 21, 2008.

<p>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The
Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States
Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Affymetrix,
Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051. This is a sole
source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one
responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy
agency requirements. This is a requirement of the Cereal Disease Laboratory, MWA, ARS, USDA at St Paul, MN for an
Affymetrix GeneChip. The services required are the design and manufacture of a
custom DNA microarray having over 6.3
million features per array. Affymetrix microarrays with 5 micron features and a
49 format design can accommodate 6.5 million probe locations within 1.28 square
centimeters.:<span>&nbsp; </span>The above specified
supplies are required to conduct the research that has been funded by the USDA
ARS NRI and which has passed peer-review. No other microarray platform can
accommodate the number and density of features required for this project on a
single microarray. Our previous work has been conducted with Affymetrix
GeneChip expression microarrays.<span>&nbsp; </span>Continuing work on arrays with the same platform design will allow for
data to be directly comparable without introducing additional unknown
variables. Affymetrix sells from inventory, more than 20 different GeneChip
expression arrays including those designed for hosts of the fungal
phytopathogens to be included on the microarray: Arabidopsis, tomato, wheat,
barley and rice. The range of organisms, information density for arrays and
broad selection of microarray products is unique to Affymetrix.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having the same expression platform for
pathogen and host will allow for simultaneous expression studies in both
organisms with directly compatible results. All equipment and infrastructure is
in place in St. Paul for processing Affymetrix arrays including the GeneChip
Scanner 3000, Fluidics Station 450, 640 Hybridization Oven, GCOS/ GeneChip
command console, GTC, expression console, GCOS Server and GCOS Development
Server Software, External Developers&rsquo; Packages, NetAffx and other supporting
software packages, service and technical support.<span>&nbsp; </span>Purchase of microarrays of different design
may require purchase of additional equipment or software for analysis.This requirement is part of&nbsp; ongoing research and the capabilities to hybridize and scan these chips have been previously set
up by Affymetrix as part of their core service. No telephone inquiries
will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written responses
including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability
to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office
within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be
noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received
in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a
comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If
no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be
held with Affymetrix without further notice. This acquisition is being
conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified
Acquisition Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide consultation services, as specified below.  The Center for Disability (CD), Social Security Administration (SSA), utilizes the services of medical staff under contract to adjudicate disability cases (as a member of a team), as well as to review disability claims.  Reviews are critical to the successful operation of the program.  Most case reviews are for the purpose of determining whether disability decisions made by the State Agencies (Disability Determination Services) are in accordance with SSA guidelines.

SSA components may also occasionally seek other services such as medical training or medical advice on disability program-related issues.

Contract work does not require direct contact with claimants.  

The contractor will provide the Government written consultations and/or evaluations resulting from the contractor review of SSA disability case files.  Services required are as follows:

	Review of medical evidence in ones specialty (or specialties) as identified in the contract;
	Review of medical evidence in other specialties in which the contractor is qualified; 
	Provide for combined or overall evaluation of a case, which encompasses the contractors medical review and that of other MCs;
	Consultation with the full-time medical staff as it relates to the development of SSA disability policies, including the development of SSA quality control procedures;

 Participation in the training of other MC contractors and other personnel from SSA Central Offices, SSA Regional Offices, and/or the State Disability Determination Services; and work with Government and non-Government agencies and/or medical or non-medical personnel that have a related interest to provide input regarding SSA programs and its objectives.

Consultants must be capable of providing an acceptable, understandable, written document addressing the medical issues relative to the disability program that arise as a result of the contractors case reviews.  Consultants are expected to maintain a high level of expertise in their specialty or related areas.  Seminars and other Continuing Medical Education (CME) are essential and must be scheduled on non-work time.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in Block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

    Washington, DC 20590
    Telephone: (202) 475-3454  
     Fax:  (202) 475-3904

Anticipated award date is on or about MAY 25, 2008.  Contact Deborah Glass at Deborah.J.Glass@uscg.mil  or 252-334-5472 for questions regarding this solicitation.

Question:

I am seeking clarification on the due date of deliverable.  The description indicates all deliverable are due at the COTR on or about July 18, 2008, but also indicates the Period of Performance for the Contract is one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's signature on the Contract.  Please clarify the deliverable due on July 18, 2008 versus those due one year from the date of contracting.

Answer:

The USTDA Regional Team would like to work towards completing the DM by July 18, 2008 but this is a soft deadline.  The one-year requirement of the contract is something that the USTDA Contracts Department requires as a deadline for the fulfillment of the contract.

<DESC>Please be advised that Modifications 1 and 2 that were done to this posting were in error. We are re-posting the original description for clarification. Original description as follows:

The purpose of this effort is to assess suitability of specific commercial and governmental space orbit determination and propagation astrodynamic algorithms for the space surveillance catalog maintenance function. The Space and Missile Center is conducting an assessment of specific orbital astrodynamic algorithms in support of the space catalog maintenance function of the Integrated Space Situational Awareness (ISSA) Program.  In particular, the two types of algorithms that will be evaluated are: orbit determination and orbit propagation.  At a minimum these algorithms must meet the following criteria:

1) Accept inputs for processing radar and optical sensor metric observations.
2) Calculate an initial satellite orbit and update the state of an existing satellite orbit that complies with a classified secret accuracy requirement.
3) Propagate a satellite's orbital position into the future (typically 24-72 hours) that complies with a classified secret accuracy requirement
4) Perform the above calculations equal to or faster than current capabilities.  

For this evaluation, the Government will provide: a) initial satellite positional state, b) observations to perform the orbit determination, and c) specified propagation interval, for a number of test cases.  The contractor will run the cases themselves and provide the results to the Government in a format to be specified.  The Government will hold those results in escrow before providing the "truth data" (reference orbits) back to the contractor for their analysis.

The contractor may then analyze the output to determine the difference between their results and the Government- provided "truth data" (reference orbits), as well as analyze computer speed/performance results.  The contractor may share a copy of these data with the Government in a format to be specified.  

Finally, the contractor must be able to receive and appropriately handle DoD Secret, FOUO, and CUMI data to participate in this assessment. Applicable NAICS Code is 541712  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units Parts, and their Auxiliary Equipment and Parts (size standard is 1,000 employees). Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged. The primary point of contact is Capt Brian Vesey, Brian.Vesey@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310) 535-2635 and the secondary point of contact is Maj Todd Wiest, Todd.Wiest@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310) 416-1759


This notification and the opportunity for evaluation of company products/capabilities is not a solicitation for bids or for proposals.  Participation in this evaluation is voluntary and at the expense of the companies that choose to participate. There will be no resulting contract or request for proposals. The Government will use the data to assess capabilities that exist in the market that could possibly meet a Government requirement. If the Government chooses to acquire the above described capability in the future a separate announcement in FedBizOps will be made. 

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from contractors. The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of data.  Interested parties may call the Ombudsman at SMC, Mr. James Gill.  You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (amendment 0001) is to distribute the revised Section 1.4, Program Goals, provided in the attachment to the original synopsis (N6893607R0061). Also provided is the questions and answers which were discussed at Industry Day held at NAWCWD, China Lake on 15 August 2007, and the Industry Day Attendance Log. The following specifications have been designated as program goals and were defined in order to indicate the target characteristics and operating environments that are extremely important.  The overall goal is to develop a weapon 0/0 sensor that is capable of attacking the following target types in the environments listed. 1. Provide a sensor that can detect and track, and report (to the DASH core processor) moving, relocateable, and stationary targets in adverse weather conditions. Sample Target Descriptions:  ships, technicals (armed civilian vehicles), armor, air defense units, small boats, structures, and specific aim points on targets greater than 9 m2 (stationary or moving). Typical target radar cross sections for analysis can be: Ford Pickup: 10 dBsm; 7 meter boat: 15 dBsm; Armor: 13 dBsm; and a Frigate at 50 dBsm. For infrared analysis use an Effective Target Contrast of 2 C and an NE&#61508;T &#8804; 130 milliKelvin. 2. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track moving targets with a minimum discernable velocity of no more than 5 knots, with 1 knot desired, and a maximum velocity not less than 80 knots. 3. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track moving targets executing weaving maneuvers up to 0.3 g's. 4. Demonstrate the ability to detect and guide to stationary targets in adverse weather conditions. 5. Demonstrate the ability to detect and track the targets in a variety of weather and environmental conditions defined as: a. Clear Weather: 23 km visibility b. Haze/Smoke/Dust: 5 km visibility c. Rain < 5mm/hour  d. Fog < 0.5 km visibility e. High Humidity:  21 g/m3 f. 0/0 Conditions: Zero  meters visibility, zero meters ceiling g. Day and Night h. Military Operations in Urban Terrain Environment i. Desert Environment (China Lake range representative) j. Rural Environment k. Mountainous Environment l. Forest Environment m. Jungle Environment n. Ice and Snow Environment o. Maritime Environment (littorals included, NAWCWPNS Sea Range Pt. Mugu representative) i. Maximum Sea State of 6 (winds to 33 knots) 6. Demonstrate a detection range in excess of 6 nmi against a 10 dBsm target.  Available prime power is a function of the weapon and power source. Weapons with batteries can be assumed to have 100W available. Other weapons with generators can have up to 400 W available. If more power is required that will be a trade study at the weapon system level. 7. Demonstrate a sensor field of regard in excess of 50 degrees in elevation and azimuth ( 25 from boresight) 8. Demonstrate the sensor relative target location error supports a weapon system CEP of less than 3 meters. 9. Demonstrate the sensor has sufficient resolution to support Automatic Target Recognition algorithms and aim point selection on targets with a physical extent greater than 9 m2. Lock On After Launch (LOAL) requirement. 10. Demonstrate a sensor tracker than can maintain tracks on the five targets nearest the cue location until they fall out of the sensor field of regard. this tracking capability must be part of the sensor processor, not part of the DASH Core Processor. 11. Demonstrate the sensor in a 5" diameter form factor such as the DSU-33 volume. The goal is for the production DASH to fit entirely in the DSU-33 volume. For demonstration hardware, the "back end" components can exceed the DSU volume; however the aperture should remain in the DSU-33 form factor to simplify flight certification. 12. Demonstrate the sensor supports both lock on after launch (LOAL) and lock on before launch (LOBL) functionality for fire and forget operation. 13. Demonstrate off axis launch capability up to at least 25 degrees. A Zuni type application where the target is at least 25 degrees off the missile axis in primarily a lock on before launch application. 14. Demonstrate that the 0/0 sensor tracker can provide track update rates in excess of 5 Hz to the DASH core processor for the final ten seconds of flight. 15. Demonstrate that the sensor provides enough information to perform target identification or that the sensor design accommodates the inclusion of an imaging sensor into the DASH form factor. a. Target identification will include distinguishing combatant water and land craft from noncombatant water and land craft. b. Target identification includes distinguishing a machine gun equipped pick up truck from a noncombatant pick up truck. 16. Provide analysis that the 0/0 sensor can be produced affordably to support a DASH production cost of $15,000.00 per round for a 6,000 unit production rate for 5 years. The $10K portion for the 0/0 sensor is a rough estimate with the core processor and imaging sensor, if required, additional, but staying under the $15K total. 17. Demonstrate the sensor design does not require significant launcher and launch platform interface modifications. For the initial demonstration show the sensor test operation is compatible with existing aircraft and weapon interfaces. 18. Demonstrate the sensor subcomponent design is compatible with a variety of weapon airframes including Zuni, JDAM (DSU-33), JSOW, and Tomahawk. 19. Demonstrate the tracker output is compatible with the DASH core processor and sensor fusion algorithms, use of a STANAG or NATO format is desired. a. The DASH Core Processor design is to be determined b. The DASH Sensor Fusion algorithms are an out year development. c. Flexibility in message format and utilizing standard communication interfaces between subcomponents is desired. 20. Demonstrate the sensor is compatible with a captive carry environment on an F/A-18 C/D including flight elevations of 30,000 feet. 21. Demonstrate the ability of the sensor to detect and signal the core processor when the weapon is a specified distance from target impact.

<DESC>The Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC) intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the services of a qualified electrical/mechanical contractor to upgrade the emergency power system at the Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) of the PVAMC located at 3461 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.  The contractor will be required to provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment and supervision for the proposed work, which will include the installation of two 800 KW generators for the NHCU.  Because the NHCU will be providing continuous, 24-hour patient care while construction is taking place, the contractor will need to conduct the work with minimal disturbance to NHCU operations with only a few, late-night electric shutdowns.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES.  Contractors will be required to provide as part of their bid package at least three references that can verify that the contractor has successfully undertaken work similar in type and scope to that required by PVAMC at a 24-hour medical facility (hospital, nursing home) within the past five years.  Further details of all required submissions will be provided in the IFB.  There will be a pre-bid site inspection May 13, 2008 at 10 AM at the NHCU, for which potential bidders should register in advance by contacting the Contracting Officer at the e-mail address listed below.  Distribution of the IFB will be limited to electronic medium and the PVAMC will not provide hard copies of any documentation.  The IFB, including all bid documents, specifications, forms and drawings, will be available for download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps.gov) on or about May 15, 2008.  It is the responsibility of bidders to access that website and obtain copies of all relevant documents.  The deadline for submission of bids and the date of bid opening is expected to be June 16, 2008.  All inquiries regarding this opportunity must be made in writing to the Contracting Officer, preferably by e-mail to the e-mail address specified below.  The estimated construction cost range is between $500,000 and $1,000,000 and the estimated period of construction is one year.

<DESC>Change:  The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is deleted from this requirement and will be procured under a separate procurement.<BR><BR>All references to SATOC (Single Award Task Order Contract) are deleted and replaced with MATOC (Multiple A ward Task Order Contract).  The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity an d re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial tasks as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experienc e for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented uns atisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.  Other solicitations for  similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.<BR><BR>Duration:  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial base period of twelve (12) months with up to four (4) option perio ds of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.<BR>
