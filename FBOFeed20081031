<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB FL is requesting information concerning concepts for selectable or variable effects weapons. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses on existing and future weapons capable of being deployed from current and future manned and unmanned platforms to perform required missions
<p>The Air Force is working to develop weapons that give the warfighter the flexibility to select the type of effect a weapon will place on a specific target. Current asymmetric warfare scenarios dictate that some targets be immediately neutralized with minimal effect to the surrounding area (minimize collateral damage) yet not a concern for many other targets. Targets vary from buildings, to personnel in the open, and to personnel located in complex urban settings including moving vehicles. Current cylindrical steel-cased blast fragmentation warheads distribute fragmentation radially in all directions from the detonation point in order to maximize a statistical hit probability and probability of lethality for a given area. Many fragments travel far beyond the intended target creating collateral damage hazards, especially in urban engagements and close air support. Thus, operations involving close air support and "pop up" targets in urban settings frequently require restricted rules of engagement which dictate minimization of collateral damage.</p>
<p>Currently there is no capability available in a single weapon that can deliver a selectable effect from focused lethality with very low collateral damage (VLCD) to high lethality on unconstrained targets of interest. VLCD lethality is described to be a tightly constrained area of lethality around a restricted radius of effect. Placing this selectable effect weapon on aircraft would improve combatant commanders' flexibility and effectiveness by maximizing the efficiency of air asset utilization and reducing the kill chain timeline necessary to prosecute a spectrum of targets (personnel, structures, and moving targets) in a variety of settings (close air support, urban, and unconstrained open).</p>
<p>The information submitted should include these general characteristics of a selectable effect weapon:</p>
<p>-- The weapon should be of an air to ground configuration. The weapon should be capable of being deployed primarily by fighter aircraft with a desired capability of being deployed off of bombers, Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), and special mission aircraft <br />-- The total weight of the warhead should not exceed 500lbs (Mk-82 Class)<br />-- The weapon should be precision guided with a capability to prosecute a spectrum of targets (personnel, structures, and moving targets) in a variety of settings (close air support, urban, and unconstrained open)<br />-- The weapon should have at least two (2) selectable effect modes (min/max), focused lethality with VLCD (tightly constrained area of lethality); and enhanced/maximum lethality for unconstrained targets<br />-- Provide any estimates for lethal and collateral damage radii of effect for proposed weapon(s)<br />-- A third mode (medium) or a variable scale is desired but not required<br />-- Provide a weapon integration scheme for each type of aircraft<br />-- The weapon could be a rail, rack, or tube launched/dropped<br />-- Near-term (program of record 2012) and mid-term (program of record 2016) solutions are being considered. Please indicate when each concept would be mature enough and available for a Milestone B and Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development &amp; Demonstration.<br />-- Provide notional programmatic information including top level schedules and order of magnitude costs necessary to achieve a mature system to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Demonstration phase by 2012 or 2016 timeframe</p>
<p>In addition to information requested above, please provide information on any other proposed solutions to the warfighter problem. These could include:</p>
<p>-- Modifications of existing weapons/weapon systems to achieve selectable effects<br />-- The combination of multiple small weapons for a synergized effect<br />-- Weapon loadout combinations for achieving selectable effects<br />-- Utilization of VLCD-capable small weapons without adversely affecting the typical loadout of current fighter aircraft<br />Example: Utilize F-16 Stations 2 &amp; 8 to deploy small weapon while not affecting stations 3 &amp; 7 (Mil-Std-1760 capable) typically used for inventory weapons</p>
<p>Industry is encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Additionally, further information/details may be requested based on initial submittals. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not plan to award a contract based on the responses from this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government.</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST), 2 December 2008. Please use subject line: Selectable Effects Weapon Concepts for electronic replies. Information submitted via mail should be addressed to AAC/PKES, Attn: Ms. Patricia Hicks, 205 West D Ave, Suite 433, Eglin AFB, 32542-6864. For technical questions, please contact 1st Lt Jeremy Boire at (850) 883-1378 or by email at jeremy.boire@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>This announcement is a follow up to prior Request for Information (RFI)/Market Surveys.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO).  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
Background
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released three prior Requests for Information (RFI); one seeking information on the air-ground network and related infrastructure (#5470), one related to the ground system, en route automation, and related processing functions (#6034) and one on industry perspectives regarding options for a potential service that integrates the components of the air-ground system into an overall Data Communication service. (#6513). After the third RFI, the FAA conducted a series of one-on-one sessions with industry.  The FAA has determined that prior to issuing further Requests for Comment, it would be beneficial to summarize the FAA's understanding of the environment in which Data Communications will operate and provide some information on decisions that have been made.  
Current Status
The FAA has completed the initial investment analysis process for the Data Communications Program, and plans to pursue an alternative to acquire Air/Ground air traffic data communication services.  Data Communications Services are a critical element in achieving the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) vision for air traffic control. The FAA is now entering the final investment analysis phase, and beginning to develop the acquisition strategy and related documentation.
Approach
The Data Communications Program will develop its strategy while considering the input of industry. In that light this communication with Industry is the first of three planned over the next several months. Subsequent communications requesting Industry comment will include a draft acquisition strategy paper, and may include the draft subnet specification or equivalent Subnet Description Document.  Separate announcements will be used to forward each of those documents for industry comment.     Overview 
The Data Communications Program is considering a single contractor to provide the air/ground VHF data link service between the FAA automation systems and the NAS users.  The exact scope of the service and contract are still under development.  The FAA intends to communicate with Industry on the details of the service acquisition in another communication as mentioned above.
This service will have a significant impact on both the FAA and NAS users, including operational, infrastructure, standards, equipage, and financial impacts.  The challenge facing the Data Communications Network Service (DCNS) contractor will be to deliver a capability in the near-term, yet evolve this capability over time. This challenge is compounded by the potential requirement for NAS users to equip in order to receive this new service.  Since Data Communications benefits for the FAA and NAS users can only be achieved when all elements of the service are in place, the challenge of the Service Provider will be to assist the FAA in balancing and harmonizing the implementation of the automation, air-ground, avionics, and applications elements of the program.  
The Data Communications Program wishes to establish a true partnership with the DCNS contractor in which the DCNS contractor would assist the FAA in meeting the Data Communications Program goals in addition to providing the FAA with a high quality air/ground VHF data service. The Data Communications program is looking for innovative, yet practical approaches to providing this partnership 
This document is provided for information. It outlines the FAA's views in several key areas, including some important considerations that any Data Communication Network Service solution must address to be successful. This paper provides the context which the envisioned service will be offered.  Industry comments are welcome, as are other thoughts on workarounds or alternatives. Please provide any input in writing to the Contracting Officer, Sue Handy, by November 21, 2008, email address Sue.Handy@faa.gov.   
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a firm, fixed-price order to procure forty-eight (48) engine oil tanks, P/N A15P3518-2, for the CH-46 series helicopter, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.  The CH-46E engine oil tank assemblies, A15P3518-1, have been experiencing high failure rates due to handling damage and repeated repairs.  The oil tank is constructed from welded aluminum, covered in a self-sealing material used to prevent the loss of engine oil, because of hostile fire.  The new tanks will replace the existing A15P3518-1 engine oil tanks, which are beyond economical repair.  The production lead-time will be nine (9) months, with a projected delivery rate of eight (8) engine oil tanks per month, with an estimated total period of performance of fifteen (15) months. The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Ridley Park, PA and will be made using Boeing proprietary drawings that define the tanks, the self-sealing covering, and all critical manufacturing processes.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the H-46 series helicopter and retains exclusive proprietary rights to all technical data.  The Boeing Company is the only firm that possesses the knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and technical data required to perform these efforts.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER.Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person's citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).
Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).Service contractor: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract.
IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENDOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.
If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

WAWF INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS AND PAYMENT FOR SUPPLIES

The subject item requires Government source approval prior tocontract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical dataavailable has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full andopen competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the government forthis item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source isnormally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal,the information detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" NavalInventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. Thisbrochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on yourcompany's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is anitem you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently beingevaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter whichforwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail toprovide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previoussubmission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not beconsidered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of asource approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/orapproval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time tomeet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continuebased on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR), Naval Air Warfare and Weapons Department (ONR 35) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for conduct of basic research in technology areas relevant to rotorcraft. As basic research, proposed projects should develop new scientific knowledge, improve theoretical understanding, and provide a basis for advances in rotorcraft technology. Research topics should focus on basic scientific issues inspired by rotorcraft technology needs and having the potential for making significant contributions towards Navy research thrusts and DoD goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research with the US rotorcraft industry, U.S. Navy, other Government organizations (e.g., U.S. Army, NASA, FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.

The proposed research should emphasize innovative, creative basic research rather than application of existing technologies. Projects should not be directed at specific aircraft or systems, and need not offer immediate or specifically identifiable improvements in rotorcraft technology. Projects that merely apply engineering methods to develop or evaluate unusual vehicle configurations or components are not of interest under this Announcement. Although software development per se is not a goal of this announcement, projects demonstrating new methods via their software implementation will be considered.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Funds Administration Services requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) intends to select a Contractor to assume the roles and responsibilities of the Interstate TRS Fund Administrator (Administrator).   The Administrator shall be responsible for all functions associated with administering the Interstate TRS Fund (Fund) including (1) collecting monies from covered interstate common carriers and VoIP providers to create the Fund; (2)  developing annual compensation rates, in accordance with Commission guidance, for the various forms of TRS; (3) determining the annual Fund size and carrier contribution factor based on the compensation rates and projected minutes of use for each form of TRS; (4) paying monies from the Fund to eligible TRS providers to compensate them for their reasonable costs of providing TRS; (5) advising the Commission on cost-recovery issues and managing and safeguarding the Fund; and (6)  Implementing effective internal controls in accordance with the standards and guidelines established in OMB Circular A-123.  The Administrator is responsible for administering and managing the Fund in an efficient, effective manner to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of the program as Congress intended.  The Contractor shall assume the Administrator functions from the entity currently performing these functions.

Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which added section 225 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), requires the Commission to ensure that TRS is available to persons with hearing and speech disabilities.  Specifically, section 225 of the Act instructs the Commission to ensure that TRS is available, “to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner,” to persons with hearing or speech disabilities in the United States.  The statute requires each common carrier offering “telephone voice transmission services” to offer TRS to persons with hearing and speech disabilities that is “functionally equivalent” to voice telephone service.

TRS is available nationwide, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, so that persons with hearing and speech disabilities can make calls to, and receive calls from, voice telephone users.  In some circumstances, TRS equipment also permits persons with hearing disabilities to communicate directly with each other (although such calls are not TRS calls).  Initially, only interstate TTY-based TRS (“traditional TRS”) minutes were reimbursed from the Fund; however, today the Fund reimburses relay service providers for several forms of TRS.  These are:  (1) interstate traditional TRS; (2) interstate Speech-to-Speech (STS); (3) interstate captioned telephone service (CTS); (4) interstate and intrastate IP Relay; (5) interstate and intrastate Video Relay Service (VRS); and (6) interstate and intrastate Internet Protocol (IP) captioned telephone service (IP CTS).

Required services are to cover a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL09000002 within 2 to 3 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis.  The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 90 days after release of solicitation.  Although it is the Government’s intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contracts Specialist/Contracting Officer, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, at 202-418-0932 or via email at anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) Barracks, Brigade Complex 2, Phase 3, Fort Drum, Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Mr. Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at Errette.J.Slick@usace.army.mil  <BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH):<BR><BR>UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room shall include, but not be limited to:  private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom, kitchenette, laundry facilities, and other amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for this facility will be:  building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I DESIGN TECHNICAL: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design, and Sustainability.  Volume II REMAINING PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY AND SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION:  Remaining Performance Capability; Proposed Task Order Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are approximately equal to price.  <BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 28 Nov 08 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0014.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due approximately on or about 31 Dec 08 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.  This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted.     <BR><BR>MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $350,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $100,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 70.0%; Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%; HUBZone Small Business 9.8%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.0%; and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 0.9%.

<DESC>A 21-acre island will be constructed by placing geotextile containers on the river bottom (in 1 to 5 feet of water) around the perimeter of the proposed island footprint.  The geotextile containers will be filled with fine-grained river bottom sediments utilizing a high-solids dredging technique that will be proposed by the Contractor.  The river bottom material will be excavated in a manner to create a channel of prescribed depth and side slopes around the entire constructed island for fish habitat.  During excavation, the contractor should anticipate encountering debris, and will separate and remove all debris from the project site.  Once the geotextile containers are filled to the prescribed height, additional dredged material will be placed within the island footprint utilizing the same high-solids method.  Erosion protection stone will also be placed adjacent to the geotextile containers in defined areas.  Lastly, a test section is required, which will consist of constructing a second layer of geotextile containers stacked on top of the first layer.  The contract will require up to 125,000 cubic yards of material in one construction season utilizing the approved high-solids dredging technique.  The contractor will also be required to provide a boat and field office for the Government to utilize for quality assurance activities.   The interior of the island will be filled to finished grade under a separate contract (Stage 2).<BR><BR>Estimated Order of Magnitude for this project:	$1,000,000 to $5,000,000<BR><BR>Plans and Specs will be available on or about 17 November 2008.

<DESC>Sources Sought to produce and deliver Mens' Army Dress Coats.

Reference: Men's Dress Coats, US Army.  NSN 8405-01-503-4073; PGC 02843.
To date, there is no solicitation in place.

Government Furnished Material (GFM) will be provided in the form of Cloth, Poly/Wool, Shade: Army Green.

DSCP requests delivery to begin immediately; preferably within the next 60 days or sooner.  An informal estimate of the delivery schedule is 5k/month for the first delivery, then incremental deliveries of 5k/month, every 30 days thereafter the first delivery.  The delivery destinations will be to various Army locations throughout the United States.

Please note that this Sources Sought is an informal solicitation for a United States manufacturer whom can produce and deliver quality Men's Army Dress Coats.  In addition, the total quantity is to be determined, but an informal estimate is 20,000 - 40,000 (ranging in various sizes) and incremental deliveries will be required over the next few months.  

The Berry Amendment will apply as follows:
The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as “The Berry Amendment”) impose restrictions on the DoD’s acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and “specialty metals” (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.  Again, the Berry Amendment will apply.  All material and labor must be 100% domestic (United States and its possessions).  Any material or labor outside of the United States and its possessions will not be eligible for this inquiry.  In addition, all subcomponents of the Dress Coat must be 100% domestic; no foreign material (buttons, labels, cloth, etc) can be used. 

The Specification and Technical Data of the Army Dress Coat is available and will be provided upon request.

2. ISSUANCE DATE:  October 31, 2008
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS:  November  28,  2008
4. POSITION TITLE: Senior Energy Advisor – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 95,390.00 - $ 124,010.00  per annum (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  January  2009 – January 2011
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

Based in Pristina, the Senior Energy Advisor will be assigned to the USAID/Kosovo Economic Growth (EG) Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of the Mission’s energy sector policies and activities.  The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the Mission’s principal technical resource on energy sector development and as the Mission’s primary point of contact on matters relating to energy programming.  As a highly qualified professional, substantial reliance will be placed on the Senior Energy Advisor to independently plan and carry out the specific activities entailed in fulfilling major duties and responsibilities.  Energy is one of the Mission’s most challenging, high-profile and important sectors, requiring constant interaction with Kosovo’s highest level officials.  As the Mission’s senior level advisor on energy, the Senior Energy Advisor will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will be required to independently make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  

The Senior Energy Advisor will also be the Mission’s principal day-to-day liaison with other U.S. Government agencies, in particular the U.S. Embassy in Pristina, and international organizations and foreign donors engaged in providing assistance in Kosovo’s energy sector.  He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management and will advise senior level U.S. Embassy and other senior officials from Department of State, donor organizations, and host government on energy policy and reform and USAID’s strategy to support the energy sector.  He/she will meet regularly with heads of international organizations, including the International Civilian Office, EULEX, the World Bank, IMF, the European Commission and other bilateral donor agencies.

The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the focal point for all USAID assistance relating to the energy sector.  He/she will be responsible for formulating strategies for energy sector reform and development and managing energy activities.  This will include ensuring that the design and implementation of all USAID energy activities are coordinated with the Kosovar Government, international organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors active in the energy sector in Kosovo.

USAID/Kosovo’s energy-sector program is oriented first and foremost towards the pursuit of two high-level objectives: the realization “Kosovo C,” which envisages the construction of new lignite-mining and generation capacities; and the privatization of the distribution functions of the incumbent state-owned power utility, KEK.  Both of these intermediate objectives are crucial to the achievement of the Mission’s overarching objective of creating a sustainable energy industry to serve the needs of Kosovo’s own economy, and the maximization of Kosovo’s inherent comparative advantage as an electric power producer in the southeast Europe region.

BACKGROUND:

Kosovo has large reserves of high-quality lignite which, if properly managed, can be used to transform Kosovo into a major energy exporter in Europe.  However, 15 years of neglect, under-investment, and poor planning have resulted in a deteriorated energy infrastructure.  

KEK (Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës) is Kosovo’s vertically integrated electric utility that includes lignite mining, generation, and distribution (comprised of network and supply divisions.)  It is a publicly owned enterprise, governed under Kosovo’s legal framework by the provisions of the Law on Publicly Owned Enterprises. 

Despite almost seven years of efforts by both Kosovars and the international community, there remain serious deficiencies in KEK’s ability to deliver electricity.  A primary problem is that KEK collects only just over 50% of the value of electricity delivered to its distribution system, a result of high technical and commercial losses.  While the situation has improved considerably over the past eighteen months since the mobilization of a team of USAID-funded management consultants to KEK, the company’s poor revenue performance hampers its ability to make required maintenance and capital investments.

KEK’s customers are subjected to frequent planned and unplanned power outages.  The use of private generators is common at residences and business.  Because unreliable energy is frequently cited as the primary impediment to business expansion, improving the delivery of electricity is critical for accelerating economic growth.  

Kosovo C:
Kosovo’s existing lignite-fired generation capacities are ageing and unreliable.  Additionally, Kosovo’s existing lignite mines are rapidly nearing depletion.  Considerable investment is needed in both mining and generation in order to provide for Kosovo’s energy security, as well as to allow Kosovo to support its broader economic development.

The World Bank currently funds, under its Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project (LPTAP), a team of transaction advisors who are assisting the Government of Kosovo in the development of a tender package for the construction of new generation capacities and development of new lignite mines adjacent to KEK’s existing facilities on the outskirts of the capital, Pristina.  This initiative is presided over by an inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Kosovo Minister of Energy and Mining.  It is anticipated that the outlines of a Request for Proposals (RFP) package will be released for circulation and comment among the four pre-qualified bidding consortia by the end of 2008, with the release of a formal RFP package at the beginning of 2009.  It is anticipated that bidders will be invited to submit proposals for the development of a new lignite field of approximately 1 billion tons and the construction of approximately 2000 MW of new power-generation capacity.  The selected developer will likely also assume operational control (if not full ownership) of Kosovo’s existing mining and generation facilities, Kosovo A and Kosovo B.  The older (and heaviest-polluting) units at Kosovo A will be retired as new capacity at Kosovo C is brought on-line, but not later than the end of  2017.  The total value of the Kosovo C development is estimated at in excess of €3 billion.

KEK Distribution Privatization:
In October 2008, the Government of Kosovo formally adopted a decision to proceed with the privatization of KEK’s distribution functions through an open, competitive international tender.  The Government has appointed a Privatization Committee to steer the process, and preparations are now underway to appoint a transaction advisor (investment bank) to serve as the Government’s agent for the sale of KEK distribution.  USAID’s advisors are working with the Privatization Committee to facilitate timely actions and decisions, as well as to ensure actions for KEK distribution privatization are consistent with the Government’s strategic priorities for the sector, including the parallel Kosovo C development.

Ongoing USAID Activities
USAID’s advisors embedded within the Ministry of Energy and Mining provide direct and frequent counsel to the Minister and her staff on important sector development issues, first and foremost on establishing the Government’s agenda vis-à-vis continuation of Kosovo C’s development and the adoption of the objective of privatizing KEK’s distribution functions.  USAID’s advisors also work closely as advisors to the Ministry on energy sector legislation development, and as technical and management advisors to the Kosovo C project office that oversees the management of inputs provided by the World Bank-funded transaction advisors to the Government.  

USAID’s advisors have been instrumental in persuading the Government of the need to rapidly resume the Kosovo C process and achieve completion as soon as possible.  Likewise, USAID’s advisors have guided the adoption of the Government’s current position on the need to move forward with a KEK distribution privatization alongside the Kosovo C process.  Both of these processes are now on-track to be concluded by the end of 2009 or early 2010.

Since project inception in January 2007, USAID’s advisors to KEK’s management have identified pervasive systemic managerial weaknesses throughout the entire organization that are the root of KEK’s poor financial performance and abysmal service reliability.  USAID determined that for performance to improve, and to ensure the objective of a timely and successful privatization of KEK’s distribution functions, USAID’s advisors to KEK needed expanded authorities to guide management decisions affecting company strategy, operational matters, and preparation of KEK’s distribution function for privatization.  This enhanced role for USAID’s advisors within KEK has been agreed with the Kosovo Government as a condition for continued USAID support to Kosovo’s energy sector.  

USAID’s support to KEK and the privatization of its distribution functions will benefit Kosovo’s end-users through an increase in service quality, while paving the way for the sector’s sustainability through private-sector investment, including in new generation capacities (i.e., the Kosovo C power plant.)

In addition USAID/Kosovo’s energy-sector program is bolstered through participation in several regional energy reform initiatives, managed by USAID/Washington, implemented by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), the United States Energy Association (USEA), and the Higher Education for Development (HED) program.

MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 

As an overarching requirement, the Senior Energy Advisor must understand and analyze all of the complex interdependent pre-conditions, requirements and approaches for development of the energy sector in Kosovo.  The complexity and difficulty of the preconditions and needs cannot be overstated.  

It will be the task of the Senior Energy Advisor to ensure that USAID assistance is well-placed and well-implemented to support USAID’s dual high-level objectives of a successful and timely completion of a Kosovo C transaction and the privatization of KEK’s distribution functions.  This will entail significant attention to the development of Kosovo’s legal and regulatory framework in the energy sector that affects both objectives.  

The Senior Energy Advisor's major duties and responsibilities will include:

In reviewing the responses, the Government may request a meeting or teleconference with responding firms to gain further insight into their capabilities.  The Government is not obligated to hold these meetings with all or any firm.  If the Government decides to meet with a firm(s), it will only meet with firms that respond to this notice.  The Government will not reimburse costs to any firm for their participation in these meetings or teleconferences.  Firms are discouraged from including marketing informational material that does not relate to the services described in this RFI as it will be discarded by the reviewers. 

C. SCOPE:

HHS OHR is seeking solutions that consolidate, transform, and integrate the hiring process, thus addressing the current lack of an integrated hiring management. More specifically, key areas where the government seeks improvements include: 

–	Improved process efficiencies
–	Enhanced reporting and data analysis capabilities
–	Improved flexibility for unique business unit requirements
–	Increased visibility for applicants to track their status
–	Reduced time to build an announcement or classified position description
–	Decreased potential for errors caused by duplicate data entry
–	Improved user experiences.  

Solutions should address the requirements of the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) “End-to-End Hiring Roadmap” (https://www.opm.gov/staffingportal/EndToEndRoadmap.asp). HHS OHR is particularly interested in solutions that specifically address the “Hiring” and “Orientation” processes of the roadmap, including:

1.	Position Classification
2.	Vacancy Announcement Management
3.	Applicant Assessment
4.	Workflow Tracking
5.	Entrance on Duty/New Employee Provisioning

Solutions should automate and streamline these processes while complying with Federal laws and regulations. Solutions that address one or more of the processes listed above are encouraged to respond. However HHS OHR is trying to integrate these processes as much as possible so an emphasis on consolidation, integration, and interconnectivity is desired.

D. DESIRED INFORMATION:

The Government requests information on:

•	How a vendor’s solution impacts each of the five processes listed above with regards to:
–	Efficiency improvements to HHS’ current environment
–	Automation capabilities
–	Applicant visibility into tracking status

•	How a vendor’s solution can be adapted and customized, including the following components:
–	Integration with other products
–	Flexibility for unique business unit requirements
–	Performance scalability
–	International hiring support

•	How a vendor’s solution complies with laws and regulations, including:
–	Federal position classification
–	Federal employment
–	Adapting to changing OPM standards

•	A vendor’s solution’s support and reporting capabilities, including the following components:
–	Continuity planning/disaster recovery
–	KPIs and self reporting capabilities
–	Proprietary data ownership
–	Customer service support

•	A vendor’s approach for transition and implementation, including the following components:
–	Pricing models
–	Change management plan
–	Training requirements and capabilities
–	Ability to implement in groups of functionality over time
–	Implementation time
–	Implementation accelerators
	
•	Opportunities for Growth:
–	Future innovations and direction of potential solutions

•	A ROM or range in dollars to implement the firm’s solution and/or a price list of the firm’s solutions/products.

•	Contract type and contract vehicles.

In addition to seeking information from all sources, the Government would like to determine if these services can be set-aside for small business.  Small businesses are encouraged to provide their capabilities for these types of services, whether prime contractor and/or subcontractor.  All small businesses (small disadvantaged, woman owned, disabled veteran or veteran owned, 8A and hub zones) are encouraged to submit their interests, relative experience and advice on this RFI.

The capability statements are not to exceed 30 pages (not including relevant attachments and exhibits) and may be submitted via e-mail no later than November 25, 2008 to marc.long@psc.hhs.gov. The Capability Statements shall include the vendor's point(s) of contact name, address, telephone number, and email address; the company's business size, including applicable NAICS code(s). The Capabilities Statement shall include a description of similar work performed within the past 5 years including the name and number of the contract, the contract scope, type of contract, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer. 

The Government appreciates any and all information received.  All information will be kept confidential and not shared with any one outside of the government.  Any information submitted and considered proprietary shall be appropriately marked by the submitter.  Information received in response to this RFI will be used to determine the acquisition strategy for any resultant RFP.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. Background.  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>2. Scope.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain potential solutions to provide real time global positioning identification and tracking of individual soldiers on foot patrol or other dismounted combat operations in all terrains.  Platoon leaders have a requirement to remain operationally aware of individual platoon members physical location at all times. Identical information is needed above the platoon level.  Current Blue Force Tracking systems do not provide simple, lightweight, easily man-wearable individualized systems.<BR><BR>3. Requirements.  The REF is looking for a man-wearable identification system that will automatically update and transmit its coordinates to a remote receiver. Receiver must be capable of overlaying the coordinates on a hand carried electronic map display and connecting to common radio system for transmission to Blue Force Tracking via common Army communications systems. <BR><BR>3.1 The system should be installable and maintainable by the individual user, i.e. by Soldiers and must be an install and forget system, i.e. once installed it must operate without Soldier input.<BR><BR>3.2. The system must be capable of allowing a soldier i.e. platoon leader to view a display and immediately recognize the positions of members of his platoon in regard to positions referenced on a electronic map. <BR><BR>3.3. The system must be constructed in such a manner that prevents or mitigates damage from the elements normally encountered in harsh environments to include heat, dust, moisture, electrical surge and hazards related to dropping.<BR><BR>3.4  The system must be compatible with U.S. Army common battery sources such as CR-123, BA-5590 etc and communications coupling normally associated with standard Army communications equipment such as the AN/PRC-148, 117F and SINCGARS radios. <BR><BR>3.5  The system must not negatively affect or be impacted by the effectiveness of visibility, communications, or jamming capabilities.<BR><BR>3.6  The system must operate, as a minimum, 24 hours on batteries. Batteries must be changeable by individual soldiers without use of tools.<BR><BR>3.7  The man wearable individual identification system should not exceed 15 ounces in weight. The remote receiver and display system should not exceed two-pound in weight.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies which meet the above requirements and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at gregory.wagenknecht@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  The government will review RFI submissions as they are received.  The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This announcement is a sources sought for the Replacement Control and Communications System (AN/FSC-160(v) Patch and Test Facility (PTF).  All potential offerors shall notify the Government POC, Mr. Marvin Kass at (732)532-4691 or email at Marvin.Kass@us.army.mil.  In addition, if available, each offeror shall provide a generic white paper setting forth their current or future capabilities for this effort, as well as any existing contract that they may have for this work. A drawing is associated with this effort which cannot be posted.  Interested parties should contact Vernay.Salas@us.army.mil to receive the drawing. The Govenrment will not reimburse potential offerors for this information. A detailed description of the effort is as follows:<BR>1.	SCOPE<BR><BR>This document was generated to describe the engineering performance plan for the Replacement Control and Communications System AN/FSC 160 (V) Patch and Test Facility (PTF).<BR><BR>1.1	General<BR><BR>The Wideband Control Program Office of PM DCATS has a requirement for the Replacement Control, Communications System AN/FSC 160 (V) PTF for FY12.  The equipment must be in-place for operation starting in FY 13 and the installation approach must utilize minimum user circuit disruption and still allow for complete site installation. During the PTF replacement/upgrade for the Terrestrial Critical Control Circuit (TCCC) and Objective DSCS Operational Control Subsystem (ODOCS) Network circuits extended downtime is not an option. It should be noted that this document will refer to the ODOCS Network, but in the future the name will change to Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) Network. <BR><BR>The Contractor shall assemble, integrate, configure, administer to, and deliver the hardware, software, and other materials necessary to provide the capabilities of the PTF as described herein.  The Contractor shall provide equipment installation at the specified eight locations (i.e., Ft. Detrick, Ft. Meade, CP Roberts, Ft. Buckner, Landstuhl, Joint SATCOM Engineering Center (JSEC), Ft. Gordon and DCF DOCS Certification Facility).<BR><BR>Any technology recommended by an Engineering Performance Plan must be valid for the five (5) year life span of 2012-17.<BR><BR>1.2	Background<BR><BR>The Wideband Satellite Operations Center (WSOC) is a Satellite Command and Control Center (SC2C) that performs satellite transmission and payload control of wideband military satellites for the Department of Defense (DoD).  The WSOC oversees and directs the actions of terminals accessing its assigned satellite.  It activates and controls terminal transmissions, constantly monitoring the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum as seen by its collocated Satellite Communication (SATCOM) earth terminals.  The WSOC uses satellite Telemetry, Tracking, and Control (TT&C) signals to configure the communication payload and monitor the health of the satellite assigned to it.<BR><BR>Presently there are five (5) WSOCS worldwide that contain a PTF (i.e., Ft. Meade, Ft. Detrick, CP Roberts, Landstuhl and Ft. Buckner). In addition there is a PTF at JSEC (Ft Monmouth), Ft. Gordon and the DCF DOCS Certification Facility. DoD will build two new WSOCS over next several years. Each WSOC uses Terrestrial Critical Control Circuit (TCCC) systems for Command and Control (C2) of the SATCOM terminals and coordination with planning and management sites.  Low-speed serial TCCC circuits connect the WSOCs and SATCOM terminals for C2.  In addition to the TCCC, other high-speed ODOCS Network circuits interconnect satellite planning and monitoring systems between the WSOCs and their management sites.<BR><BR>The configuration of each PTF is unique to the site layout for each WSOC and the circuits it supports, but all PTFs must meet some common requirements and use common types of equipment.  The location of the PTF is designed to meet the specific requirements of the WSOC at which the PTF is installed. The PTF has a Black Equipment Area (BEA) and a Red Equipment Area (REA) to separate red signals that are in the clear (unencrypted) from protected black signals (encrypted). The existing PTF contains KG-84s and KIV-7s encryption devices, which the Government intends to replace with KIV-7M devices and associated encryption rack mount enclosures. Although the exact equipment complement and location may vary from site to site, the basic layout will consist of the BEA and the REA. These two areas will be apart from each other regardless of the site IAW National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Advisory Memorandum (NSTISSAM) TEMPEST/2-95, Red/Black installation guidance. Although each rack has the same commercial construction features, dimensions and types of components, regardless of the site location, the number of racks may vary according to the circuit requirements at each WSOC.<BR><BR>Within each WSOC, the TCCC and other ODOCS Network circuits terminate within the PTF.  The PTF is integral to each WSOC and consists of equipment racks containing equipment such as distribution frames, isolation units, modems, multiplexers, patch panels, conditioning equipment, encryption devices, and test equipment. This equipment allows PTF operators at the WSOC to exercise the essential control over circuits interconnecting the WSOCs internal subsystems with each other and external facilities. This control provides the capability to make quality assessments of circuit conditions, monitor input/output signals during operation and maintenance, resolve distributed service (caused within the PTF), and generally take any action that may be necessary to ensure fast, reliable, and secure exchange of information between those circuits routed through the PTF.<BR><BR><BR>2.	CURRENT PTF DESCRIPTION<BR><BR>The Control, Communications System AN/FSC-160 (V) (PTF) provides the various components/cabling required to interface the ODOCS Wide Area Network (WAN) circuits, the Communications Subsystem AN/FSC-130 GTC3S, the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set AN/USC-28(V), and the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Electronic Counter Counter Measure (ECCM) Control Subsystem (DECS) communications interface AN/FSC-115.<BR><BR>The PTF currently provides:<BR>"	Up to 32 low-speed GTC3S user data ports that are routed to remote user destinations (KG-84/ VERSAMUX)<BR>"	8 T1 ODOCS WAN circuits (KIV-7HS /CORNET PCU)<BR>"	10 DECS/USC-28 circuits (KG-84s/KIV-7s)<BR><BR>The PTF also provides the necessary distribution racks, isolation units, patch panels, and associated test equipment to allow PTF operators at each WSOC to monitor, analyze, diagnose and troubleshoot the circuits interconnecting the WSOCs internal subsystems i.e., (DOSS, DFCS, GTC3S, USC-28, RSCCE, DECS, WSOMs, etc.) and external facilities.<BR><BR>It provides the operator the capability to make assessments of circuit conditions, monitor input/output signals during operations and maintenance, restore disrupted service (within the PTF), and generally take any action that may be necessary to ensure fast, reliable and secure exchange of information between those circuits routed through the PTF.<BR><BR>The current PTF configuration is illustrated in Figure 1 with the exception of Ft. Detrick.  Ft Detricks configuration is illustrated in Figure 2. This configuration was installed in the WSOC in 1987 and has undergone three limited upgrades.  It should be noted that these upgrades concerned only the PTF circuit paths used by the TCCC and ODOCS Network circuits.  <BR><BR>The first upgrade, the ODOCS WAN Upgrade, replaced the Red side wiring with an RS-530 standard.  It also included replacement of the KG-84 encryption devices with the KIV-7 encryption devices and replacing some of the Versamux fiber-optic multiplexers with the Cornet Fiber Port Concentrator Units (PCU) in the WSOCs and the collocated Technical Control Facility (TCF). This Upgrade was precipitated by the requirement to increase the ODOCS Network circuit paths through the PTF to data rates of up to 1.544 Mbps.<BR><BR>The second upgrade performed added redundancy to the Cornet Fiber PCUs by adding an A/B switch on the copper side of the PCU and adding an additional PCU with a separate fiber optic cable path between the WSOC and the TCF. <BR><BR>The third upgrade was to ODOCS Network T1 data rates were required and it was discovered that the existing cabling and the patch panel modules in the ADC PatchMate Patch panels could not reliably pass T1 data rates.  As a result, the ODOCS Network circuit paths were replaced with new RS530 cables and RS530 patch modules. These changes were applied to both the Red (unencrypted) and the Black (encrypted) sides of the PTF. The patch modules (Red) for the ODOCS Network circuits were installed into the KIV-7 rack and the cables where rerouted to use the shortest path possible. In addition the existing Bantam patch (Black) panels were bypassed and replaced with RS530 patch modules that were installed in the multiplexer rack. <BR><BR>The Patch Panel rack units (RED) contain a bulkhead assembly; cross connect blocks, a RS232 breakout panel and two 18 module Patch Panel chassis. The encryption racks, units 4,5,6,7,8, contain the cables and mounting hardware for the KG-84s and the KIV-7s. <BR><BR>The Black Patch Panel racks are populated with Quick Connect Panel (QCP) blocks and bantam (tip/ring) type patch panels.  Although the intent of the QCP cross connect blocks is to provide a means for the custom configuration of each circuit, there are no known instances where this functionality has ever been employed in the WSOC.  As of this moment these QCP blocks have no real application and are superfluous to the PTF operation; therefore, the QCP blocks will most likely be eliminated from the circuits.<BR><BR>The Black Patch Panel racks are connected to the Multiplexer racks where the WAN/RU circuits are combined (multiplexed) and forwarded to the corresponding units housed in the TCF. <BR><BR>The limited PTF upgrades have not solved the underlying challenges/limitations of the current PTF configuration.  The challenges and limitations of the current PTF are:<BR><BR>a.	Obsolete/unsupportable equipment (i.e., Versamux multiplexers)<BR>b.	Incompatible equipment Versamux and PCUs<BR>c.	Non industry-standard wiring throughout the PTF<BR>d.	No expandability or modularity<BR>e.	Dated rack design (bulkhead connectors and QCP) that provide unnecessary complexity and no expandability<BR>f.	Limited documentation/drawings<BR>g.	Old patch panel technology<BR>h.	Single threaded fiber-optic connectivity for the GTC3S (Versamux)<BR>i.	Maintaining a standard configuration at all sites<BR>    <BR>Figure 1. Current PTF Configuration in the WSOC and Co-located TCF<BR>   <BR>Figure 2. Ft. Detrick PTF and TCF Configuration after the Army TCF Upgrade<BR><BR><BR>3.	PROPOSED REPLACEMENT PTF<BR><BR>The current PTF is functional but is severely limited in its ability to pass high speed data (230 Kbps and Higher) reliably.  In addition, most of the wire/cabling is non-conventional and over twenty (20) years old. The PTF for the most part is without spare signal paths which negate the functionality of the Patch Panels. Also because the encryption devices (i.e., KG-84s and KIV-7s) have or will in the near future become unsupportable, the PTF needs immediate redesign and replacement; as a minimum, for the TCCC and ODOCS Network circuits for the locations (five (5) WSOCs and three (3) sites) identified in Paragraph 1.2 (Option A). <BR><BR>STRATCOM, ARSTRAT and DISA management sites (RSSC CONUS (RSO), STRATCOM (GSC), ARSTRAT (CWS), RSSC PAC (RPA), DISA HQ (DISA), SITE R (SIR), (TNG), EUROPE (EUR) and (TNC), PACIFIC (PAC), and CROUGHTON (CRO)) may also be upgraded if funds become available in the future. The Contractor would be required to replace existing ODOCS Network and TCCC circuit encryption devices (KG-84's or KIV-7's) with KIV-7M GFE encryption devices and assemble, integrate, configure and provide other materials necessary to provide the capabilities within the existing management sites (Option B).<BR><BR>The Replacement Patch and Test Facility AN/FSC-160 (V) (RPTF) specifications are listed in Table 1.  It should be noted that operational requirements may change; therefore, the new design must be patchable, modular and expandable. Also the design must utilize standard commercial racks and the cables for the TCCC and ODOCS Network. It should be noted that the KIV-7Ms and the proposed Model# 3036 KIV-7M rack enclosures will be supplied as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the contractor who will install the equipment into existing racks on-site for both Option A and B. Also it is imperative that the contractors work be minimally invasive (example, install one circuit at a time) and ensure that the individual circuit is fully operational per site requirements before proceeding to the next circuit for install.  See Figure 3 for Proposed RPTF Block Diagram.<BR><BR>Table 1 - Proposed RPTF Specifications<BR><BR>Data rate	75bps to 57.334Mbps<BR>Protocol	RS530 Synchronous (Balanced Data), RS232 (Synchronous balanced and Asynchronous)<BR>Connectors	DB-25 male/female<BR>Breakout Panels	Breakout type (tip jack for oscilloscope)<BR>Red and Black Patch Panels	Matrix Switch (RED & BLACK)<BR>Encryption Hardware	KIV-7M (2 channels per unit) (GFE)<BR>Encryption Rack Mount Enclosures	One for each two KIV-7Ms (Model 3036) (GFE)<BR>Power Distribution	12 outlets 115 VAC 60 Hz Surge Protector (2 per Rack)<BR>Clocks	External (provided from the TCF)<BR>Cable Type	Twisted pair, PVC jacket<BR>a.

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to UNC Healthcare, Chapel Huill, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, UNC Healthcare is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, FMC Butner will proceed with the sole source negotiated with UNC Healthcare.</p>

<SUBJECT>STATION KEEPING BUOY ENERGY HARVESTING/HARNESSING
<SOLNBR>DARPASN08-45
<RESPDATE>082108
<ARCHDATE>08222008
<CONTACT>SN08-45@darpa.mil SN08-45@darpa.mil, Email SN08-45@darpa.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) SN08-45: STATION KEEPING BUOY ENERGY HARVESTING/HARNESSING
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) Persistent Ocean Surveillance – Station Keeping program (POS-SK) is developing advanced concepts for a new tactical ocean surveillance buoy capable of extracting energy from the local environment for station keeping and long-term persistence.  

Based on program at-sea testing, two primary challenges for small station keeping buoys (SKBs) that require novel technologies and concepts are:  
•	Maintaining a positive energy balance and operating for long periods of time on the open ocean.  Technologies that improve the SKB energy balance problem can be categorized as:  (1) technologies that more effectively enable the SKB to harvest / harness the available energy; (2) technologies that allow the SKB to operate more efficiently (use less energy); and (3) technologies that allow the SKB to store more energy.  
•	Surviving high wind and high sea state conditions. Technologies that could improve the SKB operational survivability can be categorized as:  (1) technologies for short-term weather event survivability that could improve the chance of the SKB surviving extreme weather events that might otherwise damage or capsize the SKB; and (2) technologies for long term operational reliability.

DARPA desires to investigate component technologies that enable a positive energy balance over an extended period and can survive variable and extreme maritime environments; or system concepts with alternative energy harvesting technologies that maintain a positive energy balance, are robust enough to sustain  when ocean conditions are not favorable for an energy harvesting modality (limited solar radiation, no wind, or no waves), and can survive extreme environments.  SKB system attributes include:
•	SKB endurance: minimum 4 weeks
•	Station keeping watch circle: smallest possible while maintaining positive energy balance
•	Operate up to Beaufort scale 6 (22 – 27 kts wind; 10 ft waves)
•	Survive up to Beaufort scale 10 (48 – 55 kts wind; 30 ft waves)
•	Size when stored:  Not greater than 1-foot diameter and 8.5 feet long)
•	Ocean sensing at depths of 100-400 feet 
	
DARPA is interested in assessing new ideas and concepts in the above areas to support persistence ocean surveillance with station-keeping buoys in anticipation of future investments.  Technologies should represent a fundamental change vice incremental improvements over the status quo, based on an appropriate figure of merit.  Organizations are invited to submit a white paper (including 1 page with Executive Summary and Key Idea, 1-slide briefing chart with concept graphic, and 3-4 pages with supporting technical discussion) to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than 21 August 2008.  Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and development schedule estimates are also suggested.  

The government shall use the information provided by the white papers to determine the ultimate scope of the program.  White papers will not be returned and no feedback will be provided.  White papers should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings and will be maintained for review and then destroyed.   The information contained herein is for planning purposes and does not constitute an invitation for bids or a request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this notification or otherwise pay for the information provided.

The government is contemplating holding a workshop to present the progress to date on the current program and provide an opportunity for participants to present technologies that may potentially contribute to addressing the challenges expressed in this RFI.  Please indicate in your response if you might be interested in participating in a workshop.

<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Phone 703-875-6629, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov
<DESC>Effective February 1, 2009, the United States Department of State (DOS) will no longer be certifying anti-ram barriers under it's current Anti-ram barrier standard, STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003. Beginning February 1, 2009, DOS will evaluate only new anti-ram barriers tested under ASTM F2656-07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of Perimeter Barriers for the selection and approval for use at DOS facilities. The only barriers considered will be those with an ASTM F2656-07 rating of M30 P1, M40 P1, and M50 P1. Furthermore, DOS will only consider barriers in which the impact point has been chosen or agreed to by the DOS. As stated in ASTM F2656-07, failure to consult with DOS regarding the impact point may jeopardize the eligibility of the barrier to be installed at DOS facilities.

DOS will no longer issue anti-ram barrier certification letters for tests performed after February 28, 2008. Any tests successfully performed on or before January 31, 2008 will be considered eligible for the issuance of a DOS certification letter. Upon issuance of the last certification letter, DOS will publish the last List of DOS Certified Anti-Ram barriers sometime in early 2009. 

DOS is currently transitioning to an internal approved barrier list. This list will be a subset of all current and future barriers that meet the ASTM F2656-07 and/or STD-02.01 Revision A dated March 2003 test criteria. Barriers placed on this new list will be selected specifically for DOS facilities based on newly developed in-house critieria. Barriers will be added and removed from this new internal approved list as facility needs warrant. 

DOS wishes to thank the testing facilities, barrier manufacturers, and members of ASTM in their successful efforts in transitioning the DOS anti-ram test procedure into a self-regulated International Standard.

Potential offerors shall see attached items and below for further details regarding this acquisition.

Evaluation Factors
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government shall make an award to the offeror that submits the LOWEST PRICED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) proposal.  Technical acceptability shall be determined against the minimum specifications set forth in the attached Statement of Work entitled, "National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Enterprise Operations Directorate, Statement of Work for ISO 9000:2008, ISO 20000-1:2005 and ISO 27001:2005 ISO Certification Services."

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The following questions were asked in response to this solicitation that requires clarification.

1.	Will personnel past performance be allowed as corporate past performance?   The reason for asking this is that SDVOSB’s are many times emerging companies.
 
Answer:  This solicitation is set aside for a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) company and as such we are looking to see what past perfromance your company as a SDVOSB company has that relates to the solicitation.

2.	What will be the total number of personnel required for this opportunity?  The opportunity currently states 40 personnel for translators, but is this the total requirement for the entire contract? 

Answer:  The total requirement is not expected to exceed forty (40) personnel, however there is no ceiling.

3.	Is there an incumbent currently conducting the work now?  If so what is the company? 

Answer:  This is a new requirement.  However, the Department of State does have other Linguist contracts already in place in Iraq.

4.	If there is an incumbent we would like to request a copy of the current contract?  What are the US State Departments procedures to request a copy through the Freedom of Information Act? 

Answer:  There is no incumbent for this requirement.

5.	Can more than one SDVOSB team member make up the required 50% of the cost and work of the contract? 

Answer:  The one (1) primary contractor for each award must provide fifty one (51%) percent of the workforce.  As the solicitation references, the remaining forty nine (49% percent can be staffed by cleared, knowledgeable and tested subcontractors.

6.	 What is the expected timeline from time of award to the time executing the contract in Iraq?  

Answer:  Contract award is anticipated in January, 2009.  Task orders will be issued against the contract.  Time requirements will be determined when each task order is issued.

7.	Will there be a need for a transition period or workup?  If so, how much time will be allotted? 

Answer:  The solicitation did not address this.  There is no expected or planned transition period.  That being said, there will be some period of time staffing has to be tested and deployed before work can commence.

8.	The reference to travel indicates pricing for 20 travelers, while the stated personnel count is 40.  Is pricing required for the stated 20 travelers,or the Statement of Work (SOW)  number of personnel, or is the travel pricing a placeholder for an amount to be directed by the government? 

Answer:  Please price your proposal as the solicitation has requested.  Twenty personnel are a placeholder inserted for competitors to price travel based on a common baseline for evaluation purposes.

9.	Is the Site Supervisor a full time role or will it be adjunct to other assigned linguist duties? If adjunct, how much time per day will be allocated for supervisory and administrative functions? 

Answer:  There is no Site Supervisor Labor Category.  The Program Manager and the Project Manager roles are addressed in the Solicitation in Section B.6.2, page 11 of the solicitation.  The Program Manager and the Project Manager includes Linguist duties and includes supervisory and administrative functions.  The amount of time per day is based on the immediate needs of requested services and available personnel. 

10.	Are the Program Manager and Project Manager positions anticipated to be full time or some other allocation of time? 

Answer:  The Program Manager and Project Manager are anticipated to be full time.

<DESC>AETC has a need to convert approximately 3300 hours (28+ courses) of classroom based courseware to Distance Learning in less than two years.  The objective of this program is to be able to reduce TDY to school costs while providing the training to our Airmen anytime, anywhere.  This supports the AFSO 21 program and is in line with both AFSO 21 and AETC goals.

Converting the required courses to Computer Based Training (CBT) is considered commercial in nature since it is the same service that is provided to the general public.  The final delivered product must be 100% operable with the AETC Advanced Distribution Learning System (ADLS).

The anticipated Solicitation release date is on or about 11 November 2008.  The solicitation will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside that will result in up to four indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awards.

All anticipated task orders for converting classes will be placed by 30 September 2009, with final deliveries and acceptance of converted classes occurring NLT 30 September 2010. 

Hard copies of documentation will not be made available.  All communication concerning this presolicitation notice should be addressed to 1st Lt Bryce Fiacco and Mr. Kevin Shackleford via E-mail.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), will be seeking proposals from all interested developers/manufacturers for performing activities necessary to receive Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) from the FDA for investigational circulatory assist devices for infants and/or small children. The required activities include pre-clinical tests and analyses, development and documentation of manufacturing processes and procedures, and collaboration to develop an IDE clinical study. The IDEs are needed so that the appropriate clinical study can be conducted to provide the evidence needed to support approval of Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) applications so that the devices may be marketed as Humanitarian Use Devices (HUDs). 

The contractors will conduct all pre-clinical testing and analysis and develop all manufacturing documentation necessary for the IDE in the first three years of the contract. During the third year, they will develop the clinical study in partnership with a to-be-awarded Data Coordinating Center and other pre-clinical contractors, submit the IDE, and complete the necessary activities to receive FDA approval of the IDE. Following the IDE approval, the contractors will provide regulatory, technical, and clinical support for the investigational device during the clinical study. 

Devices eligible for consideration in the PumpKIN program are limited to investigational devices that are appropriately designed and can provide suitable circulatory support for neonates, infants, and small children (<25 kg) with congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease who experience cardiopulmonary failure and circulatory collapse. Eligible devices should be designed and developed to address the unique clinical performance issues which are relevant to this patient population. Any eligible device should be substantially developed and should have undergone and successfully demonstrated reasonable performance in a relevant animal study.

This acquisition has not been designated a type of set aside, this information will be available upon solicitation posting. It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made for a period of 4 years. THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals will be available on or about October 18, 2008.  The estimated due date for proposals is January 14, 2009.

<CONTACT>Khaled Gohar, Contract Specialist, Phone 240-276-1512, Fax 240-276-1510, Email Khaled.Gohar@samhsa.hhs.gov - James G Whitt, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-276-1503, Fax 240-276-1510, Email james.whitt@samhsa.hhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is soliciting proposals on an 8(a)-Competitive basis to provide technical, administrative and logistical support services for contract technical merit peer review and objective review meetings, and contract administrative support services for SAMHSA’s Division of Contracts Management (DCM).

SAMHSA’s Office of Program Services (OPS), DCM, is required by Congress to conduct technical review of contracts through an extramural peer review process.  This requirement insures that all technical reviews are conducted impartially by a panel of highly qualified persons.  The primary peer review functions include, but are not limited to, the following activities: (1) selecting qualified expert reviewers for the technical merit review panel; (2) screening reviewers for conflict of interests; (3) selecting hotel accommodations for reviewers to perform technical merit review; (4) administering through a contractor to provide payments for accommodations and honoraria and other related expenses to reviewers; and (5) writing evaluation reports of all reviewed proposals.  The contract review team administers and conducts technical merit/peer review meetings for proposals submitted in response to SAMHSA-wide Request for Proposal (RFP) announcements.  

To perform these specific functions, SAMHSA requires a contractor to provide administrative, technical, and logistical support services for support of contract technical merit reviews, which is administered by SAMHSA/DCM.  This includes the organization, planning, and administration of SAMHSA’s extramural activities and peer review program.

In addition, DCM is required to review those projects that are announced through SAMHSA’s Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  These projects are reviewed through an objective review process.  Logistical support is required for those reviews in the form of writing services, including note-taking during the objective review meetings and writing the evaluation summary reports.  

Finally, the primary function for contract administrative support services for DCM is to provide not only the contract technical assistant for the peer reviews, but also to provide full-time, on-site staff to fill and perform contract administrative assistant and closeout administrative support services.

Because contractor personnel will be on-site at SAMHSA headquarters, the contractor will be required to have a facility located within 49 miles of the SAMHSA building, which is located at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville, MD 20857.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to have a fire wall in place that will take effect if the situation arises in which, during contract performance, the contractor competes for a SAMHSA contract that is being peer reviewed.  

The contractor will be required to:  (1) Provide administrative, technical, and logistical support services in the organization, planning, and administration of SAMHSA’s extramural activities and peer review program, including (a) conducting technical review and technical review meetings, (b) recruiting and retaining technical (peer) reviewers from a wide range of disciplines, (c) making all hotel arrangements for lodging and meeting rooms for the meetings, (d) providing a contract technical assistant for peer review activities, (e) providing on-site logistical support for the meetings, (f) providing technical writers and professional review administrators (RA’s) for the meetings, (g) developing and implementing a system/procedure for paying reviewers, (h) establishing and maintaining a reviewer, RA, and technical writer database, (i) preparing and submitting technical review summary reports for each peer review meeting, (j) developing and writing a reviewer/RA instructional packet, and (k) providing administrative support services and summary writing support services for the Objective reviews; and (2) Provide full-time, on-site staff to perform wide-ranging contract administrative assistant, closeout, and technical support functions.

The anticipated contract period of performance is a base period of 12 months, plus four (4) 12-month option periods.  The solicitation may be obtained by either of two ways: by mail, or electronically by downloading a file from FedBizOpps or the SAMHSA Web Site at http://www.samhsa.gov/contracts/contracts.html.

Files will not be made available on either web site until on or after the estimated issuance date.  Once downloaded, you should determine if you have a continuing interest in the RFP. If so, you must either write the individual identified above and request that a copy of the amendments (if any) to the RFP be sent to you by mail, or check the Web regularly for the amendments, which will be posted at FedBizOpps and the SAMHSA Web Site and can be downloaded electronically. You may choose either of the two methods for obtaining the RFP and amendments.  Note, however, that if you rely on the Web for obtaining the RFP and amendments, at this time we have no way to assure, and will therefore assume no responsibility for assuring, that you have downloaded these documents.  All RFP requests must cite the RFP Number.

Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Fax requests will be accepted at (240) 276-1510, but please confirm by phone that your fax request has been received. Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted. Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.  Pickups will not be permitted.  Reference RFP No. 283-09-0274.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) Barracks, Brigade Complex 3, Phase 3, Fort Drum, Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Mr. Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at Errette.J.Slick@usace.army.mil  <BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH):<BR><BR>UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room shall include, but not be limited to:  private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom, kitchenette, laundry facilities, and other amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for this facility will be:  building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I DESIGN TECHNICAL: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design, and Sustainability.  Volume II REMAINING PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY AND SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION:  Remaining Performance Capability; Proposed Task Order Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are approximately equal to price.  <BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 26 Nov 08 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0013.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due approximately on or about 30 Dec 08 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.  This solicitation will be issued as unrestricted.     <BR><BR>MATOC: The Government intends to award up to 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.  In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $350,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $100,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.

<DESC>By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intentions to award a sole source contract to V3 Companies of Illinois, LTD. (V3) of 7325 Janes Avenue, Woodridge, Illinois, for the purpose of providing site restoration services.  Under the contract, V3 will be primarily responsible for placing three different seeding mixtures, installing erosion control blankets (ECB), installing turf reinforcing mats (TRM) and planting the design mix of live plants.  Two environmentally significant ravines exist in parallel locations north (Janes Ravine) and south (Hutchinson Ravine) of the project site. The Fort Sheridan Estuary Restoration Project, which is authorized by Section 104 of the Estuary Protection Act of 2000, is the final piece of constructing a swale/channel to divert storm water runoff away from these two ravines.  The first part of the project was awarded by the Lake County Forest Preserve.  The USACE portion of the project is critically linked to the work currently being performed by V3 under the aforementioned contract.   The work being performed under this impending contract requires that the work be completed concurrently so that the project management of hydrological modifications does not further damage the project site.  The period of performance is for approximately 1,444 calendar days.  It is anticipated that the resultant contact will be a firm-fixed price service contract.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  STATEMENTS OF QUALIFICATIONS/RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON NOVEMBER 10, 2008.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Anita Simpkins at anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil; ENSURE THAT THE SUBJECT LINE OF YOUR EMAIL INCLUDES THE TITLE/DESCRIPTION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Award is anticipated on or about December 26, 2008. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact is Anita Simpkins at (312) 846-5372.
