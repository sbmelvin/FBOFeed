<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with several state health departments, conducts population-based, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus (GAS), and group B streptococcus (GBS) through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program of CDC’s Emerging Infections Program Network. ABCs is used to follow trends in disease rates, to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (e.g., vaccination), and to conduct special epidemiologic and laboratory studies. As a result, timely susceptibility testing and shipping to CDC of these pathogens is an integral function of ABCs.

CDC has a requirement for a contractor to conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing on all isolates confirmed to be S. pneumoniae, GAS, GBS and isolates from persons residing in states that participate in CDC’s ABCs program. The contractor will then ship in a timely fashion all isolates to CDC for additional testing. Because ABCs conducts numerous special studies of antimicrobial resistance and vaccine impact, testing and shipping of isolates and electronic submission of susceptibility data at least monthly is critical. ABCs data are used by investigators external to CDC as well as international partners, including ministries of health, to formulate policies regarding treatment recommendations and vaccine programs. Therefore, strict adherence to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines is expected.

The contractor is required to:  (1) confirm identification of isolates as Streptococcus pneumoniae, GAS, or GBS; (2) store all isolates in a manner that will ensure future viability. The isolates will be received from the CDC Streptococcal laboratory or directly from surveillance sites collaborating with CDC. Isolates received from surveillance sites then need to be shipped to CDC for additional characterization, e.g., serotyping;  (3) ship additional subcultures of each isolate to the CDC and ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory and Repository (CASPIR) for permanent storage; (4) Perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae, GAS, and GBS.

This is a full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 621511. A firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR part 15 is contemplated.  There will be a base period of performance of twelve (12) months and four 12-month option periods.  

 CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number 2005-N-02013 will be available on or about June 30, 2005.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after posting of the RFP.  All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via email trouthmurphy@cdc.gov.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at fedbizopps website for downloading when issued.  No telephone request of the solicitation will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Agency for International Development, Overseas Missions, Egypt USAID-Cairo, Unit 64902, APO, AE, 09839

Description:

This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-01-00028-04 under which Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. (M&E) provides Construction Management Consultant (CMC) services to the USAID Alexandria Wastewater System Expansion II Project. The modification will be made using the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures allowed under USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) Subpart 706.302-70 (b) 5 which states: “An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays.”  There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The government will consider all expressions of interest received within forty five days (45) after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
 
M&E is providing CMC services for the current Host Country Contract (HCC) between the construction contractor, ABB Susa, Inc. and the Alexandria Company for Sanitary Drainage ((ACSD). The HCC, valued at $74,220,310 and LE 85,680,890 (Egyptian Pounds), includes the construction for the expansion of two major treatment plants and six pump stations. The HCC which started on May 18, 2000, is 99% complete and is scheduled to finish on December 31, 2005. M&E’s Contract expires on September 30, 2005. The purpose of the contract modification is to extend the M&E Contract for a period of six months from September 30, 2005, to 31 March 2006 in order to allow for the continuation of CMC services through the end of the HCC, to demobilize, and to closeout the HCC and CMC Contracts. The only remaining work in the HCC is the completion of punch list items for which the CMC will monitor with a small staff. The contract modification will add $250,000 to the current M&E Contract amount of $9,282,209.  

The place of CMC performance is in Alexandria, Egypt.

<DESC>NASA, Kennedy Space Center intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Clinical Informatics Associates, Inc. (CIAi), 450 E 96th Street, Suite 500, Indianapolis IN 46240 pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  NASA has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Health Service (HIS) to utilize the existing electronic health record functionality of the HIS health management software system.  The HIS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) software suite was developed by CIAi and is identified as the VueCentric system.  The VueCentric system was originally developed by CIAi for the Veteran’s Health Administration.  CIAi has continued as the Sole Source vendor to implement and refine the HIS system.  CIAi’s effort for NASA is in essence a follow-on contract for adaptation of a highly specialized system for NASA that CIAi previously developed and adapted for the Government.	As both HIS and NASA develop upgrades to their respective systems, there will have to be a continuing commonality to assure compatibility and transparency of operations between the NASA and HIS systems.  CIAi has the specialized knowledge, expertise, and infrastructure required to assure success.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. EST on June 14, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

This Program will address current warfighter functionality shortfalls in information integration resulting from limitations in technology and reductions in staffing. The Program will develop advanced or novel approaches for automated integration of information from multiple intelligence sources (multi-INT) of battlespace surveillance and reconnaissance information. Technology articles resulting from this research will be software that is integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maine, George Mitchell Center, for the continued development of a water chemistry plan.  These services are in support of the Protected Resources Division of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Gloucester, Massachusetts.  As part of its responsibility to recover Atlantic salmon, NMFS is considering a project to mitigate the low calcium concentrations of one of the more downeast salmon rivers in Maine.  Low calcium may be a factor for the survival of young salmon.  As part of this effort, the University of Maine has previously conducted water chemistry analysis on three rivers in downeast Maine known as the Calcium Enhancement on Downeast Rivers (CEDAR) project.  Specifically, the University will (1) curtail collection of all samples on the Pleasant River and on the Cathance-Flume on Dodge Road; (2) Continue grab and ISCO sampling on the Cathance-lower site; (3) Continue sampling all three sites on the Dennys River, grab samples at Robinson's Camps, Lower Site, and the Weir; (4) Augment the analyte list to include pH, alkalinity, conductance, Ca, Mg, K, Na, C1, NO3, SO4, DOC, and (5) Set 2 pH levels with Dennys River water and titrate to target pH, and report required base as mg of CaCO3.  The statutory authority for this proposed contract action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The University is uniquely qualified as the principal laboratory to conduct the analysis in the downeast salmon rivers.  The University George Mitchell Center is currently used by the Maine Atlantic Salmon Commission, Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and NOAA Fisheries to conduct all water chemistry analysis as it relates to the Atlantic salmon rivers.  The period of performance is anticipated to be from June 18, 2005 through September 30, 2005.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380, Testing Laboratories.  The total estimated price is anticipated to be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: See Note 22.

<DESC>The Government anticipates awarding a contract to Advanced Interactive Systems (AIS) for development of a Virtual Warrior (VW) Initial Capability Demonstration System.  This system is a dismounted warrior training module designed to train soldiers how to move, shoot, communicate and fight in a full spectrum virtual training environment that includes complex/urban terrain. Currently, Infantry Soldiers are being trained using a DI Immersive System called SVS Squad Synthetic Environment (SSE) produced by AIS and the Virtual Integrated MOUT Training System (V-IMTS), also developed by AIS.   Furthermore, AIS has developed an SVS DI Wearable system that uses a head mounted display.   
This VW initiative will leverage the technology and components currently used in the three AIS systems described above (V-IMTS, SSE & DI SVS Wearable).  The VW initiative will incorporate AIS components used in these systems as well as explore other technologies.   The demo systems will be evaluated by Infantry SMEs who will also demonstrate the two demo systems at conferences and shows in an attempt to reinforce relevance for Soldier CATT.  This action is being processed under FAR 6.302-1,Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice is being published for subcontracting purposes only.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AMENDS THE PREVIOUS SYNOPSIS N68711-05-R-BOA TO INCLUDE ALL FIRMS WITH A BONA FIDE PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN ONE OF THE FOUR SBA DISTRICTS (SAN DIEGO, SANTA ANA, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA AND PHOENIX, ARIZONA).  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) program.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The period of performance for the first year of the BOA will end on April 24, 2006, with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  Only NAICS code sectors 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protege firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 24 June 2005; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS sectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis for Integrated Oncogenomics microarray platform for the analysis of cancer and its model systems with NimbleGen Systems, 1 Science Court, Madison, WI. 53719.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5M. Contractor Requirements:  The contractor shall provide an integrated oncogenomics microarray platform for the analysis of cancer and its model systems. The platform shall include catalog custom microarrays for any genome of interest, hybridization buffers, protocols, ancillary reagents, and microarray reuse kits.  Custom and catalog microarrays shall be provided in an on-demand manner.  The microarray platform shall be capable of performing the following assays in a comprehensive, genome-scale manner; gene expression, exon-specific gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipation on arrays, comparative genomic hybridization for DNA copy number analysis, DNA methylation profiling, representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA) for DNA copy number, and array-based re-sequencing.  NimbleGen’s integrated oncogenomics approach is the only microarray platform to offer validated applications for the study of all of these pathways, including global gene expression, DNA copy number polymorphisms (CNPs), translocations, point mutations, DNA methylation changes, and chromatin remodeling, and to make these applications available in human as well as any other relevant organism such as mouse, rat, drosophila, c. elegans or chicken, and to provide these applications in an open-systems approach. Currently, NimbleGen is the only technology that can produce an array with optimal specifications.  NimbleGen’s whole genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) platform offers a CNP assay that can detect single copy amplifications, and has probes spaced every 6Kb down the entire non-redundant genome.  NimbleGen can rapidly create custom CGH microarrays for even higher resolution analysis of biologically important chromosomal regions identified in whole-genome array CGH studies.  NimbleGen Systems is the only source known to the NCI researcher that can provide arrays that must be readable with Axon 4000b or similar scanner, accommodate up to 390,000 features per array.  Array synthesis has the flexibility to allow synthesis of arrays with probe lengths up to 85mer, has the flexibility to enable rapid protoyping (within days) to provide new array designs.    Arrays have the flexibility to enable researchers to iteratively redesign their microarray experiments rapidly and at low-cost to enable efficient, cost-effective genomics research.  Period of Performance:  This requirement will be awarded as an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a base year July 18, 2005 – July 17, 2006 with two (2), one (1) year options. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on June 9, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the fabrication of communications and GPS antennas for use on the Mini-AERCam Engineering Unit (EU). NASA/JSC intends to fulfill this requirement by contracting with Fineline Circuits. The desired delivery date for each antenna run is approximately 4 weeks from when the final dimensions are delivered. The antenna specifications given are a continuation of what Fineline Circuits has worked on and perfected for 2 years. Fineline Circuits is the only known company that has the capability to produce these antennas to specification in the short timeframe required by NASA. The Aercam is a Return to Flight item and is on a very tight schedule. Due to the current tight scheduling for AERCam, the fact that AERCam is Return to Flight, and the subsequent runs required for this design, there cannot be any delays to the schedule or duplicative costs.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Faith Based and Community Organizations have an equal right to submit competitive proposals for any resulting contract.  The BOP anticipates making a single award; however, the BOP reserves the right to make multiple awards from the solicitation.  The institution may have capacity to house more beds than those proposed, and offerors are not prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institution.  If the proposed institution houses a mixed population of BOP and non-BOP inmates, offers will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness in managing and operating the shared institution.  Institutions proposed shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting contract.  Expansion or renovation of existing institutions will only be considered if completed within 90 calendar days after this notice and may not exceed 20% of the existing square footage proposed.

The BOP intends to award a fixed-price type contract with award-fee incentives.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods.  Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions with a contractor management emphasis on quality control.  The offeror awarded the contract must be ready to accept inmates 90 days after contract award at a rate specified in the resulting contract.  Past performance and experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers.  The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.  Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government.  Information will be requested from offerors regarding past environmental activities and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located.  Prior to contract award, environmental documentation and other related information will be required in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  The BOP anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 6/16/05 with an estimated response date of 8/15/05.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.

Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: José Chávez, Gerente General, PERUPETRO S.A., Av. Luis Aldana 320, San Borja, Lima 41, Peru, Tel.: +51 (1) 617-1800 ext. 1100 and 1101, Fax: +51 (1) 617-1801. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance to collect existing geochemical data and compile a single integrated database, as well as to design and develop maps that depict comprehensive petroleum systems in all eighteen (18) hydrocarbon-bearing sedimentary basins in Peru.

The Technical Assistance will reinforce PERUPETRO S.A. initiatives to develop information tools that are needed by PERUPETRO S.A. and the private sector, and thereby support the efforts in Peru to increase both oil and gas production and foreign investment in the sector.

The Technical Assistance will lead to the development of information tools that will enable PERUPETRO S.A. and the private sector to identify un-explored areas that represent the most promising prospects for private sector investments. The first part of the Technical Assistance focuses on the consolidation of geochemical data into a standardized and accessible database that will enable the making of geochemical maps for the entire territory of Peru.  In turn, geochemical maps display surface and sub-surface evidence of hydrocarbons, which help to define the most promising areas for new exploration activities.

The second part of the Technical Assistance will utilize geochemical, gravity, seismic, and magnetic data to define petroleum systems in the eighteen (18) hydrocarbon-bearing sedimentary basins located in Peru.  Petroleum systems include source rocks, sub-surface oil and gas movements, trapping, and seeps that together support the identification of hydrocarbons reservoirs.  By defining the location of petroleum systems, the risk involved in identifying the most promising areas of commercial interest is reduced.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following tasks:
1) data selection in Peru; 2) geochemical database development; 3) definition of petroleum systems; 4) environmental impact review; 5) development impact assessment; and 6) presentation of results and final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $561,721 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (local time in Lima, Peru), July 1, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), anticipates the award of at least three indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contracts, to professional, licensed architectural/engineering firms, to provide cost estimating services. One of the contracts shall be set aside for small businesses. Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods. The Government guarantees a minimum of $50,000 awarded over the life of each contract. The total amount of services awarded under each contract shall not exceed $700,000 per year. The contract is for professional services including, but not limited to performing cost estimating services for facility and infrastructure assessments, planning studies, requirement analyses, risk assessments, and life cycle costing. The contractor shall perform tasks in generating conceptual, budgetary, and/or detailed cost estimates and life cycle cost analyses. Typical tasks may involve travel to diplomatic posts, conducting facility and/or infrastructure assessments at posts, interviewing post engineering staff, researching local cost data and construction methodologies, and generating studies, and cost estimates. The SUCCESS Integrated Estimating and Cost Management System and OBO custom cost databases shall be the primary estimating tools. The cost estimate shall be produced in both UNIFORMAT II, as outlined in Section 7.0, and in 16 Division CSI format. Knowledge and use of the International Project Risk Assessment tool is required to conduct in depth risk analysis of projects. The contractor is required to provide logistical support in the Washington, DC area.
The following disciplines are required, at a minimum: architectural, structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, physical security, and site work. The contractor’s professional staff should belong to one or more of the following professional societies and organizations: American Society of Professional Estimators; Association of Cost Engineers; International Cost Engineering Council; Society of Cost Estimating and Analysis; AACE International; Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors; Association of South African Quantity Surveyors; Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors; Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors; or demonstrate a minimum of five years experience estimating building construction in all its facets. In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offeror must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DOD) Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel assigned to this contract must also possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Subcontractors who will require access to classified information must also possess a DOD Secret FCL. All offerors shall be required to comply with security requirements as detailed in the NISPOM. If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary FCL, the Department of State shall sponsor the firm for an FCL. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of six calendar months, from selection of the final offeror, shall be allowed for this offeror to obtain the necessary FCL. After this period the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding less than three contracts. Firms, which form joint ventures, must also comply with the above FCL and personnel security clearance requirements. This is not a request for proposals. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses shall be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The DOS Fiscal Year 2005 subcontracting goals are: small business 40%; small disadvantaged business 14%; women-owned business 5%; HUBZone business 3%; and service disabled veteran business 3%.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army- ARDEC, Picatinny, NJ, intends on going sole source to NETZSCH, Fine Particle Technology, LLC, located in Exton, PA, for the purchase of an  agitator bead mill to use in grinding material to the sub-micron level. A small- scale version of the mill was tested at ARDEC due to the DoD's pressing need  for a process to produce nano-energetic materials on a large scale. The results  were beyond expectation and far beyond other processes being developed.  NETZSCH's novel approach to wet grinding material will allow ARDEC to produce  nano-energetic materials in bulk, an achievement that has not been accomplished  to date with conventional methods. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>Robert S. Vance Federal Building and Courthouse
Birmingham, Alabama, Proposed Renovation & Alterations Construction, Design Phase

Networking Session

On Tuesday, June 7, 2005, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Networking Session for Small and Large Business Architect/Engineer firms which may be interested in exploring teaming opportunities with the selected Short-Listed Lead Design A/E firms on the design phase of the renovation of the Vance FB / Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at The Vance Federal Building/Courthouse, 1800 Fifth Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama.  Signage will be posted at the Building entrance directing all attendees to the selected meeting area.

The facility to be renovated will consist of 174,000 gross square feet and will provide space for The U.S. District Court, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court with associated chambers and the Bankruptcy Clerks Office.  Space will also be included for the U.S. Marshal Service, the U.S. Attorney,  the U.S. Probation, GSA and other Federal Agencies.  There will be a maximum of 39 outside parking spaces.  The Courthouse is located within the Central Business District of Birmingham, Alabama.

The Estimated Construction Cost (ECC) is between $12,000,000 and $15,000,000 and most, if not all, design and construction disciplines are expected to be represented.  The Short-Listed Lead Design A/E firms desire to discuss teaming opportunities with qualified A/E firms to meet the GSA requirement that a minimum of 35% of the level of contract effort be performed in the State of Alabama.  These firms must have an active production office established within the State of Alabama within 90 days prior to March 7, 2005.

The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and is committed to opening a dialogue between qualified Architect/Engineer Firms in the community and State who may desire to become a part of the project with the Design Teams.

Large and Small Business Architect/Engineer firms will be given an opportunity to meet the GSA Project Team and representatives from each of the Short Listed Lead Design A/E firms, listen to a GSA presentation on the scope of the project, and to participate in question and answer session.  It is expected that at the conclusion of the Networking Session participants will be a better position to determine whether or not to further pursue teaming opportunities for this project.

Questions about the Vance Networking Session should directed to  David Gibson, GSA’s Small Business Advocate for The Public Buildings Service in The Southeast Sunbelt Region (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA>GOV.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation amendment notice is to: 1. Change the response date for the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation W15QKN-05-T- 137 from 3 June 2006 to 18 June 2005. 2. Change the following requirements:     a.  FROM: Acceleration/Decelertion-rate Progrmmable (Min: 900,000 deg/s2 TO: Deceleration rate Programmable (Min: 900,000 deg/s2) â€“ Acceleration rate Programmable (Min: 10,000 deg/s2)      b.  FROM:  Max Load Capacity (fuze only) 45 lbs TO:  Max Load Capacity 10 lbs      c.  FROM Slip Rings 20 each@3 amps TO Slip Rings 4 @ 3 amps each â€“ 16 at 0.5 amps each 3.  Provide the following answers to questions received in response to this synopsis/solicitation: Question #1:  We believe that this acceleration rate is not correct.  To achieve this level would require an explosively driven device, such as in a cannon shell.  It may be appropriate for deceleration, but at a much reduced value. Answer:  The 900,000 deg/s2 is correct. Question #2:  Max Load Capacity (fuze only) 45 lbs â€“ We believe this value is much too high and is incorrect.  The fuze, even if made from solid lead, would only weigh about 10 lbs.  We would suggest a max load of 6-8 lbs. Answer:  This is not the fuze weight itself.  Other items besides fuzes will be attached to this. Question #3:  Slip Rings 20 each @ 3 amps â€“ We believe that a max current rating of 2 amps is more appropriate.  Also, not every ring needs the full current value.  We would suggest 4 each at 2 amps; 16 each at .5 amps. Answer:  4 slip rings at 3 amps each are required.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has provided more than $157 million in FY 2003 and 2004 to support humanitarian needs in Iraq, including delivering essential medicines to healthcare facilities, providing emergency health services, and rehabilitating water treatment and sewage plants, clinics, hospitals, and schools.  

OFDA has obligated nearly $70 million in Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds (IRRF) through FY 2006 to respond to the needs of up to one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, as well as vulnerable populations in communities hosting IDPs.  Interventions aimed at reducing mortality, morbidity, and economic impact associated with displacement will help meet immediate needs, support the longer-term goal of enhancing stability within Iraq and facilitate the return of IDPs to non-contentious areas.  OFDA currently has four international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and International Organization (IO) partners.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).
The Assistant Program Officer (APO) will be a part of OFDA’s Europe, Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA) regional team within the DRM Division, as well as the part of the USAID/DCHA team in Baghdad.

OBJECTIVE

The Assistant Program Officer (APO) provides critical support to the OFDA Program Officer and ensures accurate documentation and reporting on OFDA programs.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The APO is based in Baghdad and is responsible for supporting the Program Officer position, monitoring existing programs, coordinating disaster response activities and identifying and formulating new programs in conjunction with current and possible future OFDA partners in order to fulfill OFDA’s objectives in Iraq.

Raising the profile of OFDA programs within the USAID Mission, the Embassy and the U.S. Government at large is a critical function of this position.  In this role, the APO is responsible for the following:

- Collecting, analyzing, documenting and distributing information on OFDA activities and activities of OFDA partners;
- Coordinating with cooperating agencies;
- Preparing “bullets” for inclusion in USAID daily reports; and
- Assisting with the preparation of briefing papers, operational plans, maps and talking points.

Support for Program Management and Liaison

- Continually collect, verify, analyze, and update information on the general situation, progress of relief activities, areas of concern, and maps from DCHA members and other sources.
- Provide talking points and other briefing materials as requested for various entities.
- Prepare and clear reporting requirements as appropriate according to identified procedures.  Currently the primary channel for reporting is through development “bullets” for USAID daily reports.  The primary focus of reporting should be on OFDA programs.
- In coordination with the OFDA Program Officer, and through appropriate channels, ensure the Press Officer has access to the most accurate and updated information regarding OFDA programs.

Security
- OFDA Field Personnel must adhere strictly to Embassy and Mission security guidelines and will coordinate any travel outside the “Green Zone” with the DCHA Team Leader, the USAID EXO, and other relevant parties.  All travel outside Baghdad must be cleared with OFDA’s Washington office as well.

<DESC>Any information submitted is strictly voluntary and will not be returned to the vendor.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is being released by the Department of the Air Force, Headquarters Operations Sustainment Support (HQ OSSG), Deployment System Branch, Program Office, Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex, AL. HQ OSSG is seeking potential sources interested in providing maintenance, sustainment, and modernization services for Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) Increment 2b.   DCAPES Increment 2a will be referred to in this document as DCAPES.  This sources sought synopsis is not restricted.  All interested vendors are encouraged to respond.  DCAPES is a set of software applications providing capabilities the Air Force requires to support their planners and commanders in performing tasks for contingency operations and military operations.  It provides HQ USAF, Major Command (MAJCOM), Numbered Air Force (NAF)/Air Component, Field Operating Agency (FOA), Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), Air Force reserve component, and wing/base planners support to plan, source, mobilize, deploy, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute forces supporting contingency and crisis operations inside joint and warfighting commanders' projected decision cycles. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will be both in-garrison and deployable; it will be an integral part of the Global Command and Control System- Air Force (GCCS-AF) and use the GCCS communications infrastructure. Air Force Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC) is the sponsoring command for DCAPES INCREMENT 2B requirements. Current systems have not kept pace with recent changes to planning and execution functional processes.  These systems are slow in response, inaccurate, inflexible, non-interoperable, and are unable to assimilate necessary data to support activities.  Approved, Final Multi-Command Mission Need Statement CAF-AMC-AFMC-AETC-AFSPC-AFSOC 616-94 for DCAPES applies. DCAPES also supports the AFC2ISRC Integrated Command and Control (IC2) Capability Mission Needs Statement (MNS) 04-98, 22 Sep 99 which identifies the need to field Command and Control (C2) capabilities to support the full spectrum of air and space operations. In concert with these goals, DCAPES integrates previously developed and fielded deployment management systems to exchange information and function in a more efficient and logical manner. Integration is achieved by implementing refined architectures and standards and migrating current and/or new systems to comply with the Global Information Grid-enterprise (GIG) system. Successful integration will result in required levels of interoperability and information exchange with appropriate agencies and C2&ISR systems as expressed in the DCAPES 2b draft Capability Development Document (CDD).  DCAPES supports deliberate and crisis action planning by providing users the capability to receive and analyze taskings; develop, compare, and prioritize alternative Courses of Action (COAs); and prepare documents which support Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), Unified Command, and Air Force requirements and taskings. Specifically, DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will help planners to electronically access USAF planning and execution data; create and maintain War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)-3/4/5 data; exchange data with other command and control systems; create and manage Unit Type Codes (UTCs); produce Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD); compare planning data in different databases; perform feasibility and capability analysis in support of logistics, manpower, personnel, and transportation requirements; and develop planning and execution documents. DCAPES supports the preparation and dissemination of alert, warning, mobilization, execution, and operation orders. It assists with Air Force reserve component activation tasks. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will support deployment operations by providing users the capability to electronically direct, monitor, and document authorized movement of forces and materiel to areas of operations, and manage changes to established movement schedules. It will support the planning and execution of sustainment/replenishment operations. It will also support termination/redeployment operations with the same capabilities used for deployment operations. Lastly, DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will produce standard and ad hoc reports, and process feedback reports for input into the Joint Uniform Lessons Learned System (JULLS). DCAPES requires extensive use of external system resources and information to be effective. A secure on-demand communications infrastructure with sufficient capacity is required for all operations. This infrastructure is increasingly critical as operations are distributed and the volume of priority information increases. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems provide most of the information that DCAPES uses to perform its war/deployment planning and execution mission. Information operations support is required to protect networks and communications infrastructure and provide the freedom to operate. GIG enterprise services must mature and be fully implemented across the DoD to capitalize on the investment that the Air Force will make in Interworking & Interoperability (I&I) using GIG enterprise services.  DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will use the modernization efforts of disparate systems to integrate applications and tools and extend the interoperability of these systems. As Joint Command and Control (JC2) mature and is fielded, DCAPES INCREMENT 2B, as part of GCCS-AF, will migrate to and help GCCS-AF become the Force Employment-Air and Space Operations Mission Capability Package (MCP) of JC2.  Proposed Approach:  DCAPES, as part of the C2 and ISR systems that support Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE), will be integrated Machine to Machine (M2M) with C2 processes and automation tools to execute effects-based operations in a Net-Centric environment that meet time and effectiveness criteria. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will use an integrated, interoperable, common, standard, open-system architecture GIG enterprise service to provide global integrated C2 horizontally and vertically at all levels of operations. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will use common and consistent functional and technical capabilities across mission boundaries and eliminate duplication in functionality, support requirements, acquisition management, and integration. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B  integrates automated decision support applications and information exchange capabilities. In doing so, as part of GCCS-AF, it will position itself to fold into JC2 as an integral MCP through design. The approach is to transition current systems to a fully I&I single application-titled Force Employment-Air and Space MCP as a section of JC2. Key to the transition is integration and increased interoperability with the ten Air Force C2 application sets (DCAPES, WMP, ECSS, LOGMOD, LOGCAT, LOGFAC, MANPER-B, AEF Libraries, ASPEN and HAF-MDS) that currently support the Air and Space mission. This is an evolving assimilation of current capabilities into an interoperable suite to enable greater efficiencies and reduce operator workload through enhanced software utility. Initially, the most significant and measurable increase in capability will be in information sharing, followed by collaborative planning, shared awareness, and finally self-synchronization.  DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will be maintained by a combination of Air Force and contractor personnel. Organization and depot levels of maintenance are planned. System instructions, operating procedures, and information presentations will be standardized across the commands. Training will be required for system administrators, database administrators, functional users, maintenance personnel, and systems, network and security managers. The system will process UNCLASSIFIED through SECRET level data with an objective of TOP SECRET processing. It will meet the Department of Defense (DOD) Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM) interoperability requirements. DCAPES INCREMENT 2B must be interoperable with DOD's Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), the Air Force Command and Control Network (AFC2N), and Air Force open systems architecture command and control systems.   DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will be implemented at HQ USAF, MAJCOM, NAF/Air Component, FOA, DRU, Air Force reserve component, and wing/base designated locations. HQ USAF will declare Air Force-wide system Initial Operational Capability based on MAJCOM commander inputs. Once DCAPES is fully operational at all participating locations, HQ USAF will declare Full Operational Capability for the Air Force-wide system.  DCAPES INCREMENT 2B will allow seamless integration of new capabilities to meet time constraints and footprint objectives and accomplish robust and efficient information processing, storage, transport, and dissemination management with guaranteed information assurance. The system is in full compliance with the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) 22 August 03 as a transition step to an Air and Space Mission Capability Package (MCP). JC2 MCPs are sets of Service/agency-provided software applications supporting joint mission capabilities:  Force Projection, Force Readiness, Intelligence, Situational Awareness, Force Employment-Air/Space Operations, Force Employment-Joint Fires/Maneuver, and Force Protection.

<DESC>"Technical Support for Toxicology, Chemistry, Human Exposure, Environmental Fate and Ecological Assessments of Pesticides" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any Small Businesses (SBs), Non 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), SBA 8(a) Program Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and/or Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs)  that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide technical support as described in the draft Statement of Work for the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs/Antimicrobials  Division (OPP/AD).   EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) as required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996, institutes procedures for the registration of pesticides.  OPP develops data requirements and study guidelines that are used to assess the potential impact pesticides may have on human health and the environment.  Before using these data for regulatory purposes, OPP must evaluate the studies to determine their adequacy and to guarantee that appropriate quality assurance (QA) procedures were carried out.   OPP also convenes workshops and seminars to discuss and resolve scientific issues related to the registration and re-registration of pesticides. Under Section 33 of FIFRA (as added by subsection (f)(2) of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003), the EPA will collect fees from registrants to register their pesticide chemical for review.  The benefit of this Fee is to guarantee the registrant that the time frame for registering their chemical will be reduced. 		As a result of the new FIFRA amendments the Antimicrobials Division was created in 1997.  The division was assigned the task of assisting in the reduction of antimicrobial pesticide registration and re-registration backlog.  With the new amendments the AD was given the authority to regulate the sale, distribution and use of antimicrobial pesticides.  All antimicrobial pesticides must be registered by EPA before they may be imported, sold or distributed in the U.S. Registered uses include disinfectants, slimicides, algaecides and sanitizers.        	Re-registration Eligibility Documents (RED's) are the mechanisms through which EPA announces a pesticide's eligibility for re-registration.  All pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be initially registered by the EPA prior to sale or distribution.  The re-registration process is necessary to ensure that older pesticides meet today's standards for ensuring human and environmental health.  The EPA issues its decision about re-registration in RED documents and summarizes the decisions in RED Fact Sheets.  The RED documents for each pesticide or pesticide group describes EPA's risk-assessment and risk management decisions, product-specific data and required product-labeling changes, and requirements for continued use of the pesticide in the United States The objectives of this potential contract are to: -	Review toxicology (including acute, chronic and sub-chronic), chemistry, 	human exposure, environmental fate, residue and product chemistry, and 	ecological data packages to enable the Office of Pesticide Programs'  	Antimicrobials Division (AD) to complete registration and re-registration 	initiatives.   -	Conduct data search and retrieval of toxicology, chemistry, ecological 	effects, environmental fate and exposure, and human exposure data from 	internal Agency databases, as well as external scientific databases in 	support of AD's re-registration effort.  -	Provide support in the preparation of the final RED drafts under the 	guidance of AD.  Support may include contractor participation in AD 	training geared toward instructing the contractor on the six-phase RED 	process.  OPP/AD will use the results of these contractor reviews and 	evaluations to support environmental and human exposure assessments 	used in making regulatory decisions, specifically those related to  	re-registration and special review of antimicrobial pesticides Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) which will be posted to the following web-page on or about June 01, 2005: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0511833/index.htm The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.0 million for potential socioeconomic program businesses.  The current contract is 68-W-01-036 with an approximate maximum value of $7.2 million for five years period ending 09 April 2006 with Versar, Inc. (a large business under the applicable NAICS code) as the incumbent.   The potential contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort type with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods with a maximum estimated cost of approximately $7,500,000.   Any interested small business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section I Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested socioeconomic program concerns who believe they have the capability of providing services as defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within the 10 page limitation.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information (RFI) for Host-Based Security Manager Support

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR HOST-BASED SECURITY MANAGER SUPPORT.


SUBJECT:

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for host-based security tools and centralized manager applications that could be deployed on host-machines across the DoD.  Traditional efforts to secure Department of Defense (DoD) networks have been focused on placing defenses at the network boundary with less emphasis on end-point or host-based security.  While such defenses as network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have proven effective at countering identifiable threats originating from outside the network boundary, they do not address the insider threat or defend against external threats that are able to penetrate boundary defenses or enter through backdoors.  Such threats include viruses, worms or other attacks that target known or previously unknown operating system and application-specific vulnerabilities.  In order to address the insider threat, increase end-point security, reduce end-point management requirements, and provide defense in depth, DoD is considering integrating existing capabilities and fielding enhanced host-based security products and associated integrated managers across the enterprise. 

Under the host-based security concept, security products are installed directly on network end-points.  In general, this means installing agent-based tools on host machines (e.g., workstations, laptops, servers).  In order to be effective across enterprise networks, host-based capabilities must be centrally managed to support installation, monitoring, updating, and configuration however, existing security product management requires an independent manager for each of the multiple products, in effect, reducing time available for detection and response efforts as a result of the excessive redundant management requirements.

DoD intends to integrate existing security products and capabilities, eliminate redundant management processes, and enhance end-point security through a unified security product and management suite.  The intent is to reduce the impact of management traffic and redundancy of end-point security agents.  For this RFI, the following descriptions will be used: 

Central Manager: The portion of the host-based security manager suite that provides the central management functionality is called the central manager.  The central manager provides centralized installation, management, monitoring, and configuration of host-based Information Assurance (IA) capabilities.  This central manager will reside at Tier 3, however it must be able to accept policy and configuration changes from higher-level tiers. Security information collected by Tier 3 central managers will report to higher tiers as well as an external security information manager (SIM). 

Host Agent/Modules(s):  Those tools (or portions of tools), which actually perform the tasks associated with protecting host machines, are referred to as modules in this RFI.  The local host capability to communicate with the central manager and control modules is referred as the host-based agent or just agent.  The capabilities listed in Section 3.0 could be provided either by a single agent with multiple modules, the use of multiple agents/modules, or a combination of the two.  Each module will implement the security policies to be enforced using a set of rules that may be modified by the central manager. 

Additional definitions regarding the functions and designations of host-based security components are given in Attachment 3.  A copy of Attachment 3 can be obtained from either Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


DESCRIPTION:

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of host-based security capabilities to enhance the CND posture of the DoD computer network systems. 
The DoD host-based security concept for acquiring and implementing capabilities on DoD computers and computing platforms follows the Network Operations (NetOps) Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the Global Information Grid.  Under the NetOps CONOPS, the DoD is organized into three tiers to conduct CND.  Tier 1 provides DoD-wide CND operational direction and support to all DoD components.  Tier 2 provides DoD component-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1.  Tier 3 provides local operational direction and support and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity.  Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and supporting entities, such as the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO), CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and the National Security Agency [NSA]), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center.  Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND and associated major command entities.  Tier 3 includes all entities responding to direction from DoD Component Tier 2 CND Service Providers, e.g., local control centers that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either deployed or fixed at DoD installations.  A copy of Attachment 1 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr. Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.


REQUIREMENTS:

This section describes the desired capabilities for the Host-based Security Manager.  The DoD does not expect that any one product will have all of the capabilities listed however, a goal of the Host-based Security Manager is to provide as many of these capabilities as possible under a single management architecture.  A solution with multiple products under a single manager is acceptable for the purpose of this RFI.  Individual products with a subset of these capabilities are also of interest, and vendors and/or government organizations with these solutions are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  A copy of Attachment 2 can be obtained from the either Capt Strakos or Mr. Carr.  Phone numbers and e-mail addresses to contact Capt. Strakos or Mr. Carr are specified under paragraph 5.

<DESC>DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the shelf and commercial-off-the shelf products that can meet the requirements for the Air Force Enterprise Information Technology Service (AF EITS) Storage initiative. 

The DESIRED END STATE is a Global Air Force Storage Capability that is in alignment with the end state described in the AF EITS Strategy, Version 1.0, 25 March 2005 as follows:
·	A protected storage environment that supports day-to-day and long-term data and information.
·	Access, archiving, retrieval, staging, and delivery of on-demand information to support AF and joint information requirements.
·	Build upon and fully leverage the existing computing and transmission layer information technology.
·	Leverage the power now resident in storage management software functionality that the USAF has already invested in.
·	Complement existing IT with tools that allow AF IT professionals to remotely monitor and manage storage as an enterprise asset.

The end state shall be in accordance with Information Life-cycle policies and procedures (AF Information Management/Data Management Policy, DoD Net-centric Data Strategy etc.). Furthermore, the software/hardware to provide the capability to meet the desired end state must satisfy all mandatory NCES, GIG requirements and be compliant with DISR-Online.

Our current initiative calls for:
•	Consolidation of core (Web, E-mail, File, & Print) services and mission critical applications at the regional level
•	Consolidate local/Base level data into a MAJCOM centric storage nodes
•	Development of ILM policies and procedures
•	Standardized Record Management practices
•	Indexing coupled with discovery services
•	Centrally managed, physically distributed storage
•	Tactical storage infrastructure (based on warfighter requirements)
•	Content delivery networks
•	Tiered Storage (HSM, data mobility / migration) 
•	Inclusion of other existing components such as Air Force Knowledge System (AFKS) and Enterprise Information Management (EIM) storage infrastructure
•	Metadata storage 
•	Federation with NCES storage service
•	Utilization of DISA DECC
•	Distribution/Centralization of Storage as a web service
•	Storage Management Software to support remote monitoring and management
•	Continuity of Operation
•	Shared Spaces to support COIs
•	Day to Day & Long-term data storage (structured, unstructured, multimedia, file systems)
•	Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) enabled
•	Authoritative data sources
•	Service level Agreements
•	Secured
•	Interfaces with other AF EITS services & legacy environments
•	Mechanisms supported
•	Time stamping
•	Replication
•	Controlled Duplication if necessary
•	Concurrent access
•	Caching
•	etc.

At a minimum the vendor’s RFI submissions should answer the following questions:
1.	How does the vendor’s capability/concept support the AF EITS end-state?
2.	Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards to meet any of the Air Force’s or Department of Defense’s requirements?
·	This is a major interoperability concern; in our future enterprise storage solution all data must be available regardless of hardware vendor or operating systems.
3.	Does the proposed capability/concept allow for storage virtualization, including
·	Storing and recalling data regardless of file system, operating system, data format, storage hardware vendor or physical location.
·	Rapid availability of data to all levels of command.
4.	Is the capability easy to deploy, maintain, learn and use?

<DESC>CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FLEET MAINTENANCE PARTS ACQUISITION INITIATIVE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information on a requirement for the acquisition, storage, security, and management of automotive parts to support the CBP Fleet Management Branch (FMB). The Government seeks information from industry to assess the feasibility of having a vendor or vendors assume the responsibility for the operation and management or automotive repair parts operations at CBP fleet garage facilities.

The Government seeks alternative approaches to establish and maintain this source or sources of repair parts supply management. In keeping with this goal, the Government seeks industry input to:

·	discover additional sources for our expanding program
·	discover and implement best practices for procuring these services and supplies

Part Acquisition:  Planning for parts acquisition on the part of the vendor rests on the premise that vendor owns all parts within the stockroom or parts still under the control of the vendor until the issuance of a work-order and associated parts request to service a vehicle or other item that is being serviced. With the receipt of the work order and issuance of the requested part(s), the vendor completes an invoice and submits it to the Government. In the event that a part is returned to the stockroom, the vendor issues a corresponding credit to the garage. Provide information concerning the honoring all warranties issued by the manufacturer or according to the part supplier. 

Buy Back Program: Include a provision in the response for procedures to inventory and assess the viability of all parts on hand that the Government has purchased in the past. Vendors will purchase these parts when they assume responsibility for them. The only exception to this requirement is for those parts deemed obsolete. The “buy back” program will be valued at the fair market value as defined as Cents on the Dollar. This can be offered as a one-time rebate or as an outstanding credit account to use in lieu of present cost. It is assumed the vendor may perform an audit of a facility to obtain an idea of the parts structure and the financial investment of the program.


Warehouse (stockroom) Management Information System (WMIS):  Provide the plan to establish and  maintain an inventory management system . Government Information Technology requirements mandate that the vendor-provided WMIS must be compatible with the CBP system of record to exchange all transactions and  ensure compliance with “Standard Accounting Practices” and the Federal Management Record” (FMR).

Stocking Requirements:   For planning purposes, the vendor must maintain an inventory accuracy [measured by random cycle counts] of no less than 99% to ensure that parts are available as the WMIS states. Additionally, the level of inventory shall not exceed 7 turns per year to help ensure current and “fresh” inventory of all parts. The parts inventory must provide for all vehicle types stationed (domiciled) at the location or as part of a satellite facility of the primary facility.

Stockroom Standards:  Vendors must establish the stockroom within the confines of the facility as allocated by CBP. The vendor must provide for structure such as a door or wall, fencing, locked cabinets to ensure the security of the parts inventory. It is also the vendors responsibility to ensure compliance with all OSHA, EPA and any local/state/federal building codes including electrical, fire suppression, structure integrity and any other codes that are required. To facilitate planning, the stockroom will initially occupy the current footprint with in the garage, however as part of the request for information a vendor can perform further analysis to identify the need for a reduction or an increase in square footage.

Technology: The vendor must plan to provide all infrastructures to operate the parts warehouse/stockroom. The infrastructure may/will include any cable, wireless, radio frequency or other technological items that support, the sharing and exchanging inventory and transactions within the facility and tied to the vendor’s main/ or satellite parts locations [another vendor or distribution facility]. 

Hazardous Materials: Provide the management plan to address the storage of any hazardous material stored within the stockroom or still owned and controlled by the vendor. The plan must comply with  all federal/local regulations. Additionally any relevant training and recorded data associated with the hazardous material must be current in the Material Safety Data Sheets book as mandated by law. It is the role of the vendor to ensure that the MSDS is current and that the training is compliant and that the vendor retains training records. However, the facility management has the option to randomly audit any training records to ensure that they are current.

Staffing:  Provide the plan for staffing of the stockroom during all regular hours of operation and any scheduled overtime or additional shifts that are added on a permanent basis or a short-term basis.

There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.
This Request For Information is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will issue a procurement action. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. The Government will safeguard proprietary information in accordance with applicable Government regulations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is EDOCIO-05-000171 and is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.  The NAICS Code is 541511 with a small business size standard of $21.0M.

The Department of Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer (ED/OCIO) intends to solicit and award a brand name or equal contract for consolidation of Tripwire Licenses maintenance.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Tripwire and or Tripwire authorized distributors under the authority of FAR 6.302.  However, the Government will consider all "equal to" capability statements received by the closing date for quotes.   The Tripwire software is currently installed across the Department's computer network and the need for it is ongoing.  ED/OCIO provides an integrity management and file tracking software application which enables the Department to reduce operational risk and gain control over its information technology system files stored on servers and network devices.  Tripwire is the only product that specifically addresses data file integrity by detecting and exposing unintended changes, circumvention of change management processes and compromises of security on files through a centrally managed console.  This information is vital in ensuring ED possesses the best possible file tracking software application.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item, prepared in accordance with FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Direct all questions or inquiries referencing this RFQ to Mona C. Selden, Contract Specialist (301) 415-7907, or e-mail mcs1@nrc.gov.  All offers shall be submitted by mail NO LATER THAN 12:00 noon, NRC local time on 06/14/05, and addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Division of Contracts, Attn. M.C. Selden, RFQ No. NRR-05-029, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852. Solicitation No. NRR-05-029 herein is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under FAR Part 13. Proposals received after the date and time specified for receipt of proposals shall be considered late in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. This RFQ is a small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System Code is 541330.  The small business size standard is annual receipts for the preceding 3 fiscal years not-to-exceed $4.0M. BACKGROUND---The NRC staff is reviewing a license amendment request from Entergy to operate the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station (VYNPS) at extended power uprate (EPU) conditions (20% above the original licensed thermal power).  Recently, some nuclear power plants have experienced problems with certain components following implementation of approved power uprates. For example, steam dryers at certain boiling water reactor (BWR)plants have developed cracks and, in some cases, fractured metal parts from the steam dryer have entered the reactor coolant system and steam lines leading to the turbine generator. The steam dryer in the upper section of the reactor vessel of a BWR nuclear power plant removes moisture from steam generated from feedwater in the reactor core before the steam is directed through piping to the plant turbine generator to produce electricity. The steam dryer is constructed of metal plates that force the steam to change directions abruptly to remove moisture, which is then returned to mix with the incoming feedwater. The steam dryer is intended to remove essentially all of the remaining moisture from the steam to prevent damage to the turbine. Industry representatives have indicated that cracking in steam dryers occurred during the early operational phase of some BWR plants.  During recently approved operation under EPU conditions above the Original Licensed Thermal Power (OLTP), steam dryers designed with a square hood and internal braces at certain BWR plants have developed cracks along with an increase in moisture carryover to the main steam lines. Steam dryers designed with square hoods but without internal braces, or designed with slanted or curved hoods, have not experienced significant cracking during plant operation under EPU conditions to date. Plant-specific equipment problems during operation under power uprate conditions have been discussed in NRC information notices and during public meetings.  For example, in NRC Information Notice (IN) 2002-26, “Failure of Steam Dryer Cover Plate After a Recent Power Uprate” (ML022530291), the NRC staff describes the failure of a cover plate on the outside of the steam dryer at Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2, which broke loose in June 2002 under 17.8% EPU conditions, and caused pieces of the dryer to be swept down the main steamline. This degradation of the steam dryer at Quad Cities Unit 2 was revealed by an increase in moisture carryover and minor perturbations in reactor pressure, water level, and steam flow. The licensee evaluated the cause of the steam dryer cover plate failure and determined that the failure was due to high-cycle fatigue. The NRC staff discussed another failure of the steam dryer at Quad Cities Unit 2 in IN 2002-26, Supplement 1, “Additional Failure of Steam Dryer After a Recent Power Uprate” (ML031980434).  In that instance, the licensee’s inspection of the steam dryer at Quad Cities Unit 2 in June 2003 revealed an extensive fracture in the steam dryer outer bank hood, detached or severed internal braces, and cracked tie bars.The NRC staff prepared IN 2002-26, Supplement 2, “Additional Flow-Induced Vibration Failures After a Recent Power Uprate,” to alert licensees to equipment performance problems under EPU conditions at Quad Cities Unit 1. After identifying high moisture carryover levels at Quad Cities Unit 1 such as that which occurred at Unit 2, the licensee shut down Quad Cities Unit 1 in November 2003 and found significant damage to the steam dryer.  In addition to lengthy cracks in the steam dryer, the licensee determined that a piece of metal approximately 6.5 by 9.0 inches in size and 0.5 inches thick was missing from the steam dryer at Quad Cities Unit 1. From the early stages of the review of the VYNPS EPU submittal dated 9/10/03, the NRC staff has emphasized that steam dryer integrity was an area receiving a very high level of attention by the NRC due to industry operating experience with steam dryer failures following EPU implementation. Although steam dryers do not perform a safety-related function, they must maintain their structural integrity to prevent the occurrence of loose parts in the reactor vessel or steam lines that could adversely affect plant operation. The NRC staff considers the structural failure of steam dryers and other plant components to be safety significant when their failure adversely affects the ability of safety-related components to perform their safety function or when the generation of a large number of loose parts from their failure has the potential to affect safe shutdown of a reactor using safety-related systems. On 01/31/04, Entergy submitted Supplement 4 to its original submittal to address and provide analysis of the VYNPS steam dryer issue. During the course of the review of this supplement, in order to resolve the steam dryer concerns, the NRC staff requested additional information, held three public meetings with Entergy, and performed an audit of the steam dryer analysis at the General Electric office in San Jose, California. Based on review of the information provided by the licensee in its submittals during public meetings on 7/23/04 and 7/24/04, and as part of the audit at GE Nuclear Energy, the NRC staff concluded that the licensee’s analysis of record was inadequate to demonstrate that the steam dryer at Vermont Yankee would be capable of maintaining its structural integrity under EPU conditions. Specifically, the licensee’s analysis of the Vermont Yankee steam dryer as then submitted in support of its EPU request (1) had not adequately identified and verified the excitation sources for flow-induced vibration mechanisms that resulted in significant degradation of similar steam dryers at other BWR nuclear power plants operating at EPU conditions; (2) had not provided a complete load definition for the Vermont Yankee steam dryer for EPU conditions in light of several assumptions that have not been adequately justified; (3) had not justified the applied methodology as realistic in light of assumptions to account for uncertainties that resulted in apparent significant overestimation of predicted steam dryer stresses; (4) might be non-conservative based on assumptions for reducing the stress experienced by steam dryer parts and the movement of the potential fatigue failure location as a result of modifications to the Vermont Yankee steam dryer; and (5) had not validated the extrapolation of pressure peaks from original power levels at the three reference BWR plants to EPU conditions for the steam dryer at Vermont Yankee. During the audit and a public meeting on 9/29/04, at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, MD, Entergy indicated that further information would be submitted to address the NRC staff concerns related to steam dryer integrity. On 3/3/05 and 4/5/05, Entergy submitted a revised steam dryer analysis that includes an acoustic circuit analysis, computational fluid dynamics analysis, scale model testing and validation of the acoustic model and the computer code that generates the final forcing functions used in the dryer analysis. Technical expertise is required by the staff to assist in the review of the  licensee’s revised analysis of the structural capability of the steam dryer at Vermont Yankee for EPU conditions.  OBJECTIVE--The objective of this purchase order is to obtain technical expertise to assist the staff in determining the adequacy of Entergy’s analysis to ensure the structural integrity of the Vermont Yankee steam dryer during EPU operation. SCOPE OF WORK AND SCHEDULE--TASK 1--. Become familiar with the technical issue by

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 12.6 – STREAMLINED PROCEDUES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS – AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTATIONS ARE HEREBY REQUESTED AND NO FURTHER WRITTEN SOLITATIONS WILL BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR FIRM FIXED PRICE QUOTATIONS. The Solicitation Number is NE-EK0000-5-00274.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition
Circular 2001-23. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541618.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS), Requirements, Planning and System Integration Program (RPSI), has a requirement for studies to be produced developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.

BEST VALUE SOLUTIONS FOR SOLAR WIND AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS

Introduction: Studies conducted over several years have demonstrated that several government agencies have requirements that could or must be met in earth-Lagrange 1 (L1) or Artificial Lagrange Orbits.  (See Attachment F) These requirements include acquisition of solar wind data, and telecommunications access to the Earth’s South Pole, and to the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) satellites.   NOAA,  the National Science Foundation (NSF) , and the Integrated Program Office (IPO) are issuing this joint Broad Agency Announcement in the belief that many of these requirements can be met with a common architecture with resultant economies for all customers.  Other studies have indicated that a commercial solution may offer additional economies. We are particularly interested in commercial solutions that would allow us to buy our needed data and telecom services in a manner similar to current commercial communications services.  

Purpose:  
Task I.  To produce studies developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.   Responders have broad latitude in proposing solutions that may cover a range of strategies from a government owned satellite system to the commercial satellite provision of data and telecom services, or any other strategy that meets the requirements referenced herein. The government intends to award multiple study contracts in 2005 for up to $300,000.  

Task II. To develop innovative concepts for meeting some or all of NOAA’s requirements for Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Imagery.  The government may award multiple study contracts up $100,000.

Responders may submit proposals for either #1 or #2 or both. 

Intent and Schedule:  Input from these studies will be used to guide the government in the strategy it employs to satisfy the requirements referenced herein.  Preliminary funding for a solar wind data acquisition might begin as early as 2008.  Proposals are sought from responders who legally eligible to be providers of the services that are the subject of this BAA.

Responders should be aware of a relevant program under consideration at NASA:

 NASA’s Centennial Challenges Program has announced a Partnership Opportunity that includes prizes for stationkeeping solar sail missions.   The government’s choice for solution of the requirements referenced in this BAA might include commercial services from an orbit that requires solar sail propulsion.  In that case, the government might include in its consideration for contract award any results from possible solar sail prizes awarded under NASA’s Centennial Challenges program.    Parties interested in competing for any Centennial Challenges solar sail prizes are advised to monitor the Centennial Challenges web site at www.CentennialChallenges.nasa.gov for further information.

Business Models for Requirement Solutions:  Develop a business model, preliminary costs, and supporting technical and architectural designs for meeting any or all of the current agency requirements listed herein. Business models should be supported with the fullest possible level of detail.  Responders are encouraged to include corporate plans, statement of assets, and any other relevant information.  Proposals may include any reasonable assumptions regarding ground systems for data reception and relay, and for satellite command and control e.g. commercially provided ground facilities, government owned facilities, commercial use of government assets etc.  However all cost assumptions must be clearly specified.  

Additional Customer Requirements:  Proposals to this BAA should be developed primarily for the Current Requirements referenced herein.  However responders may choose to propose a business model that includes additional customers, either commercial or other government requirements.  For instance, NOAA and NASA have been jointly considering architectures that meet NOAA’s requirements and provide communication and/or navigation services to the Earth and/or Moon to meet a portion of NASA’s future Space Exploration and Science needs.  The market research supporting the inclusion of any additional customers’ requirements should be included.


I.	Current Agency Requirements:

1. NOAA   Solar Wind Data Requirement:  NOAA operates the Space Environment Center in Boulder, CO, which has a requirement for specified solar wind measurements every minute from a defined area of space.  Responders are asked to provide yearly costs for provision of such service, and to propose any length of contract that provides best value to the government.  All solar wind measurement requirements must be met by any proposed solution.

Solar Wind Measurements:  Attachment A
Solar Wind Measurement Location:  Attachment B

2. NSF Telecommunications Service Requirements:  
The National Science Foundation manages United States Research Programs in Antarctica.  NSF is facing an acute data communications problem with regards to its rapidly growing scientific base at the South Pole.  Attachment C contains a Request for Information advertised in Commerce Business Daily in 1999 summarizing this deficit.  Responses to the 1999 RFI have not resulted in a solution of the problem listed therein.

NSF would optimally prefer to have a continuous (24-hr/day) Internet capability with data rates in excess of 50Mbps for interconnection to the U.S. Next Generation Internet infrastructure.  There is a growth potential to 100 GB/day in the post 2010 timeframe.
Cost is additionally a major concern, with a desire to remain within or better than current government rates from commercial service. 

Responders are encouraged to consider whether all or a portion of the NSF requirement could be satisfied in a logical and cost effective manner from a platform that is also monitoring solar wind data.  You may suggest any trade or number of trades between current South Pole ground assets and/or changes to South Pole assets, and the communication subsystem on the solar wind platform.  You should propose end-to-end service that delivers the data to Raytheon Polar Services Company in Centennial, CO.  

Responders should assume that uplink and downlink capability from a solar wind platform would have been demonstrated prior to contract service.  They should develop costs and a business approach for yearly prices for contracts of whatever length provides best value to the government. 

3.  Integrated Program Office (IPO) Telecommunications and Observations Service Requirements:  

a.  Telecommunications - The Integrated Program Office manages the procurement of the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).  This satellite series will perform environmental monitoring for a joint NOAA/USAF program.   Its current proposed ground system architecture consists of 15 ground sites (Safetynet Attachment D) linked mainly by fiber connections with limited commercial communication satellite relay.  Earlier studies have indicated that the NPOESS High Rate Data (HRD), approximately 17 Mbps per satellite, could be cross-linked through two satellites placed out of the ecliptic, north and south, and such a strategy could result in large gross savings through the closure of most of the Safetynet ground sites, as well as an improved data latency for the NPOESS system.  

Responders are invited to further develop this concept in light of the potential opportunity presented by a solar wind platform.  Responders may propose any practical solution for the data cross-link between the solar wind platform and the NPOESS satellites.  
Responders should develop a scenario under which the cross-link capability is demonstrated; and then used in a secondary, back up mode to the baseline RF downlink on NPOESS satellites C1-3.  NPOESS C4-6 would use the solar wind platform cross-link as their primary data relay, while keeping their RF system for backup.  Responders may also suggest other transition schedules if merited.

b. Observations - NPOESS will also carry a suite of sensors that will allow the production of a set of Environmental Data Records (EDRs) defined in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).  Several studies have examined the desirability of meeting EDR requirements in an orbit similar to the proposed solar wind platform. (See Relevant Studies at end of document.)  Responders are invited to assess the IORD and identify any NPOESS EDRs that could be met with at better-value-for-the-government from the solar wind platform.

Costs and business approach should be developed for:
      1.   The cross-link experiment between an NPOESS satellite and the solar wind platform
2.	A programmatic scenario for transitioning the NPOESS data relay system toward cross-linking data through the solar wind platform while diminishing reliance on the Safetynet ground sites.  
3.	NPOESS EDRs to be delivered from the solar wind platform


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENT

Task II. NOAA Coronal Mass Ejection Imagery:  NOAA has a requirement to track the progress of Coronal Mass Ejections as they transit from the sun.  Our prior assumed technical solution used a telescope with an occulting disk (coronagraph), mounted on the solar platform of the GOES satellites.  Some preliminary results have also recently been reported using the technique of all-sky imaging on the SMEI satellite.  A preliminary assessment has also suggested that it might be possible to meet some portion of the NOAA requirement for CME imaging by upgrading imagers flown on a solar wind platform for other purposes.  

We are interested in what new technical approaches might meet our requirements on any space platform.  We are also interested in innovative solutions that could meet some or all of our requirements from the solar wind platform if that is a good value solution.  Cost and mass are significant considerations.  Our requirements are reflected in Attachment E1 and E2.



SERVICE RELIABILITY

In general government services are required at be continuous and reliable at the 96-98% level with no breaks in service longer than 15 minutes tolerated.  We recognize both the novelty and complexity of providing operational services from a station located at as great a distance as the L1 orbit. Therefore in the development of costs we request that two sets (or more if desired) of cost figures be presented:
a.	The best value solution cost to the government and the estimated reliability that cost number supports
b.	Any suggested solutions and incentives that could make progress toward the 98% reliability level

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 12.6 – STREAMLINED PROCEDUES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS – AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTATIONS ARE HEREBY REQUESTED AND NO FURTHER WRITTEN SOLITATIONS WILL BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR FIRM FIXED PRICE QUOTATIONS. The Solicitation Number is NE-EK0000-5-00274.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition
Circular 2001-23. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541618.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS), Requirements, Planning and System Integration Program (RPSI), has a requirement for studies to be produced developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.

BEST VALUE SOLUTIONS FOR SOLAR WIND AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS

Introduction: Studies conducted over several years have demonstrated that several government agencies have requirements that could or must be met in earth-Lagrange 1 (L1) or Artificial Lagrange Orbits.  (See Attachment F) These requirements include acquisition of solar wind data, and telecommunications access to the Earth’s South Pole, and to the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) satellites.   NOAA,  the National Science Foundation (NSF) , and the Integrated Program Office (IPO) are issuing this joint Broad Agency Announcement in the belief that many of these requirements can be met with a common architecture with resultant economies for all customers.  Other studies have indicated that a commercial solution may offer additional economies. We are particularly interested in commercial solutions that would allow us to buy our needed data and telecom services in a manner similar to current commercial communications services.  

Purpose:  
Task I.  To produce studies developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.   Responders have broad latitude in proposing solutions that may cover a range of strategies from a government owned satellite system to the commercial satellite provision of data and telecom services, or any other strategy that meets the requirements referenced herein. The government intends to award multiple study contracts in 2005 for up to $300,000.  

Task II. To develop innovative concepts for meeting some or all of NOAA’s requirements for Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Imagery.  The government may award multiple study contracts up $100,000.

Responders may submit proposals for either #1 or #2 or both. 

Intent and Schedule:  Input from these studies will be used to guide the government in the strategy it employs to satisfy the requirements referenced herein.  Preliminary funding for a solar wind data acquisition might begin as early as 2008.  Proposals are sought from responders who legally eligible to be providers of the services that are the subject of this BAA.

Responders should be aware of a relevant program under consideration at NASA:

 NASA’s Centennial Challenges Program has announced a Partnership Opportunity that includes prizes for stationkeeping solar sail missions.   The government’s choice for solution of the requirements referenced in this BAA might include commercial services from an orbit that requires solar sail propulsion.  In that case, the government might include in its consideration for contract award any results from possible solar sail prizes awarded under NASA’s Centennial Challenges program.    Parties interested in competing for any Centennial Challenges solar sail prizes are advised to monitor the Centennial Challenges web site at www.CentennialChallenges.nasa.gov for further information.

Business Models for Requirement Solutions:  Develop a business model, preliminary costs, and supporting technical and architectural designs for meeting any or all of the current agency requirements listed herein. Business models should be supported with the fullest possible level of detail.  Responders are encouraged to include corporate plans, statement of assets, and any other relevant information.  Proposals may include any reasonable assumptions regarding ground systems for data reception and relay, and for satellite command and control e.g. commercially provided ground facilities, government owned facilities, commercial use of government assets etc.  However all cost assumptions must be clearly specified.  

Additional Customer Requirements:  Proposals to this BAA should be developed primarily for the Current Requirements referenced herein.  However responders may choose to propose a business model that includes additional customers, either commercial or other government requirements.  For instance, NOAA and NASA have been jointly considering architectures that meet NOAA’s requirements and provide communication and/or navigation services to the Earth and/or Moon to meet a portion of NASA’s future Space Exploration and Science needs.  The market research supporting the inclusion of any additional customers’ requirements should be included.


I.	Current Agency Requirements:

1. NOAA   Solar Wind Data Requirement:  NOAA operates the Space Environment Center in Boulder, CO, which has a requirement for specified solar wind measurements every minute from a defined area of space.  Responders are asked to provide yearly costs for provision of such service, and to propose any length of contract that provides best value to the government.  All solar wind measurement requirements must be met by any proposed solution.

Solar Wind Measurements:  Attachment A
Solar Wind Measurement Location:  Attachment B

2. NSF Telecommunications Service Requirements:  
The National Science Foundation manages United States Research Programs in Antarctica.  NSF is facing an acute data communications problem with regards to its rapidly growing scientific base at the South Pole.  Attachment C contains a Request for Information advertised in Commerce Business Daily in 1999 summarizing this deficit.  Responses to the 1999 RFI have not resulted in a solution of the problem listed therein.

NSF would optimally prefer to have a continuous (24-hr/day) Internet capability with data rates in excess of 50Mbps for interconnection to the U.S. Next Generation Internet infrastructure.  There is a growth potential to 100 GB/day in the post 2010 timeframe.
Cost is additionally a major concern, with a desire to remain within or better than current government rates from commercial service. 

Responders are encouraged to consider whether all or a portion of the NSF requirement could be satisfied in a logical and cost effective manner from a platform that is also monitoring solar wind data.  You may suggest any trade or number of trades between current South Pole ground assets and/or changes to South Pole assets, and the communication subsystem on the solar wind platform.  You should propose end-to-end service that delivers the data to Raytheon Polar Services Company in Centennial, CO.  

Responders should assume that uplink and downlink capability from a solar wind platform would have been demonstrated prior to contract service.  They should develop costs and a business approach for yearly prices for contracts of whatever length provides best value to the government. 

3.  Integrated Program Office (IPO) Telecommunications and Observations Service Requirements:  

a.  Telecommunications - The Integrated Program Office manages the procurement of the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).  This satellite series will perform environmental monitoring for a joint NOAA/USAF program.   Its current proposed ground system architecture consists of 15 ground sites (Safetynet Attachment D) linked mainly by fiber connections with limited commercial communication satellite relay.  Earlier studies have indicated that the NPOESS High Rate Data (HRD), approximately 17 Mbps per satellite, could be cross-linked through two satellites placed out of the ecliptic, north and south, and such a strategy could result in large gross savings through the closure of most of the Safetynet ground sites, as well as an improved data latency for the NPOESS system.  

Responders are invited to further develop this concept in light of the potential opportunity presented by a solar wind platform.  Responders may propose any practical solution for the data cross-link between the solar wind platform and the NPOESS satellites.  
Responders should develop a scenario under which the cross-link capability is demonstrated; and then used in a secondary, back up mode to the baseline RF downlink on NPOESS satellites C1-3.  NPOESS C4-6 would use the solar wind platform cross-link as their primary data relay, while keeping their RF system for backup.  Responders may also suggest other transition schedules if merited.

b. Observations - NPOESS will also carry a suite of sensors that will allow the production of a set of Environmental Data Records (EDRs) defined in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).  Several studies have examined the desirability of meeting EDR requirements in an orbit similar to the proposed solar wind platform. (See Relevant Studies at end of document.)  Responders are invited to assess the IORD and identify any NPOESS EDRs that could be met with at better-value-for-the-government from the solar wind platform.

Costs and business approach should be developed for:
      1.   The cross-link experiment between an NPOESS satellite and the solar wind platform
2.	A programmatic scenario for transitioning the NPOESS data relay system toward cross-linking data through the solar wind platform while diminishing reliance on the Safetynet ground sites.  
3.	NPOESS EDRs to be delivered from the solar wind platform


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENT

Task II. NOAA Coronal Mass Ejection Imagery:  NOAA has a requirement to track the progress of Coronal Mass Ejections as they transit from the sun.  Our prior assumed technical solution used a telescope with an occulting disk (coronagraph), mounted on the solar platform of the GOES satellites.  Some preliminary results have also recently been reported using the technique of all-sky imaging on the SMEI satellite.  A preliminary assessment has also suggested that it might be possible to meet some portion of the NOAA requirement for CME imaging by upgrading imagers flown on a solar wind platform for other purposes.  

We are interested in what new technical approaches might meet our requirements on any space platform.  We are also interested in innovative solutions that could meet some or all of our requirements from the solar wind platform if that is a good value solution.  Cost and mass are significant considerations.  Our requirements are reflected in Attachment E1 and E2.



SERVICE RELIABILITY

In general government services are required at be continuous and reliable at the 96-98% level with no breaks in service longer than 15 minutes tolerated.  We recognize both the novelty and complexity of providing operational services from a station located at as great a distance as the L1 orbit. Therefore in the development of costs we request that two sets (or more if desired) of cost figures be presented:
a.	The best value solution cost to the government and the estimated reliability that cost number supports
b.	Any suggested solutions and incentives that could make progress toward the 98% reliability level
