The final rule, which is codified in 21 CFR 118, will be implemented in a staggered fashion with larger producers (greater than 50,000 layers) required to be in compliance by July 9, 2010 and smaller producers (3,000-49,999 layers) being in compliance by July 9, 2012. It is anticipated that awards will be made for a 12 month contract period and four (4) 12 month option periods to all the producers.

<SOLNBR>WC133M-15-RP-0011
<CONTACT>Jeanie M. Jennings, Phone 8164267458, Email jeanie.m.jennings@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to issue Request for Proposal number WC133M-16-RP-0011 for expendable dropwindsondes for the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill AFB, FL. The AOC maintains and operates aircraft in support of a variety of meteorological and oceanographic research projects. One of the primary requirements in a variety of missions involves measuring and recording the atmospheric conditions below the aircraft. The method used to obtain these atmospheric profiles utilizes an expendable dropwindsonde which is launched from the aircraft and then transmits meteorological data back to a radio receiver and processing system onboard the aircraft. The system used by the AOC and other U.S. Government agencies is called the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS). The Government intends to award a fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for a period of sixty (60) months.  The estimated quantity per year is 3000 each, however, there is no guarantee that this quantity will be required or ordered. The dropwindsonde deliverables must meet the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) drawing set requirements.  Alternate designs may be considered, however, any proposed design modifications shall include: an acceptance test procedure sufficient to verify the revised design is equivalent or improves upon the NCAR drawing set design; estimated cost to the Government to perform this design verification; and analysis of the benefit to the Government for selecting an alternate design. Best commercial practices shall be employed throughout the manufacturing process. All deliverables shall successfully pass NCAR drawing specifications prior to delivery. The Met Sensor Module of the dropwindsonde is a key component which is proprietary to Vaisala, Inc. Alternate Met Sensor Modules or discrete sensor components shall be considered only if the Contractor produces compelling evidence that the alternate design has successfully been proven to meet or exceed the performance capabilities of the Vaisala Met Sensor Module in an equivalent application. At the option of the Government, the Government may perform a test of up to eight dropwindsondes delivered under a delivery order, and up to 10% of each production lot, for compliance with the requirements of the NCAR drawing set incorporated into the contract. The Government will supply the Contractor with a single channel ground (not airworthy) AVAPS system to assist with production testing. The Contractor shall provide all additional test equipment and standards required to validate that the production dropwindsonde meets the NCAR requirements. The Government shall supply engineering assistance including: technical information exchange related to the dropwindsonde; generation of non-disclosure agreements for exchange of proprietary information; providing a source list for all dropwindsonde components; up to three onsite visits to assist with production startup; and remote support (telephone, e-mail, etc.) as required. Engineering assistance will be provided for a period not to exceed one year following contract award by the Government. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government. This acquisition is not set-aside for small business. <br />In accordance with FAR 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process will be utilized.  The solicitation will require a phased approach.  Phase I will require the offeror to submit a proposal that demonstrates they meet the minimum experience requirements.  Phase I will be evaluated under an acceptable or unacceptable (Pass/Fail) rating scheme.  Failure of an offeror to demonstrate that it meets all of the minimum experience requirements will result in the offeror being found to be technically unacceptable and eliminated from further competition.  Offerors shall submit Phase I of the solicitation within thirty (30) calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.  Offerors deemed acceptable will be notified in writing by the contracting officer.  Prior to the release of Phase II acceptable firms will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  This is required since the acceptable firms will be given proprietary information.  A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled approximately seven (7) calendar days after notice of acceptability and receipt of signed non-disclosure agreement.  Currently the solicitation will be issued on or about December 2, 2015.  <br />Any interested party must submit a request in writing to receive a copy of the solicitation to:  Jeanie.m.jennings@noaa.gov Subject Line:  WC133M-16-RP-0011.  <br />To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.  Register via the internet site at http://www.sam.gov.  In order to register with the SAM, all firms must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number.

<DESC>The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 's (NOAA) mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) supports the overall NOAA mission by focusing on stewardship of living marine resources through science-based conservation and management and the promotion of healthy ecosystems.
<p><br />NMFS is responsible for the management, conservation and protection of living marine resources within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. NMFS also plays a supportive and advisory role in the management of living marine resources in coastal areas under state jurisdiction. It provides scientific and policy leadership in the international arena, and implements international conservation and management measures as appropriate.</p>
<p>Under this mission, the goal is to optimize the benefits of living marine resources to the Nation through sound science and management. This requires a balancing of multiple public needs and interests in the sustainable benefits and use of living marine resources, without compromising the long-term biological integrity of coastal and marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Many natural and human-related factors affect the status of fish stocks, protected species and ecosystems. Although these factors cannot all be controlled, available scientific and management tools enable the agency to have a strong influence on many of them. Maintaining and improving the health and productivity of these species is the heart of the NMFS mission. These activities will maintain and enhance current and future opportunities for the sustainable use of living marine resources as well as the health and biodiversity of their ecosystems.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill NMFS' mission, a contractor is required to provide and retain the necessary qualified personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities (except as otherwise specified) to perform quality environmental, biological, and fisheries operations data collection, data analysis, and information dissemination for the West Coast fisheries observed by NMFS West Coast Region (WCR).</p>

<p>NMFS WCR has the obligation to monitor and to obtain estimates of the incidental take of marine mammals and other protected species in U.S. West Coast fisheries. Data are required to assess the potential impact of the fisheries on marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds, specifically sperm whales, humpback whales, short-finned pilot whales, other strategic marine mammal stocks, leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles, and North Pacific albatross. Data are also required to document finfish bycatch.</p>
<p>Observer coverage aboard commercial fishing vessels is mandated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA).</p>
<p>Sea-going Observers work 40 hours or more per week as the sole contract employee aboard privately-owned commercial fishing vessels. Observers are required to collect required information to assess the involvement of marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and finfish bycatch in the fisheries and acquire biological information for population and life studies.</p>
<p>A comprehensive list of actual requirements will be included in the Performance Work Statement within the solicitation package document.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is set aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 and the business size standard for this requirement is $15.0M. It is highly encouraged that any vendor meeting this size standard and desiring to be considered for award be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) using this NAICS code or a NAICS code with an equivalent size standard.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of Mission Computer Spare parts as itemized under Attachment (1) to support the E-2D tactics devices in Norfolk, VA.

The contract is planned for Raytheon (cage code 70SQ8) of Marlborough, MA under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
Raytheon is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to provide this part, since Raytheon is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the E-2D Mission Computer component parts.
 The anticipated award date is May 2016 with delivery in 2017.  The anticipated contract value for this procurement is $280K total.
Raytheon designed these spare parts to aircraft specifications and remains as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) who can meet the form, fit, function requirements necessary for timely delivery.  Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports there does not exist a commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governments requirement.  Additionally, the Small Business Office concurred with the decision to sole source to the OEM (Raytheon). 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice outlining the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Raytheon.
  Interested sources are solicited to provide their written technical capabilities.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Interested sources must submit detailed written technical capabilities to deliver the E-2D Mission Computer spares to support the E-2D tactics trainer devices to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed written capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Romy Roman-Conway (romy.roman-conway@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 applications (MS Word), no later than close of business on Wednesday, 02 December 2015. Verbal submissions via phone will not be honored.
 
All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.
 If no written challenge to this synopsis is received, a justification and approval (J and A) for other than full and open competition in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated. If conducted as a sole source procurement, a separate synopsis will not follow. This synopsis will satisfy the intent of the requirements under FAR 5.201 and 5.204.

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, through full and open competition, technical, analytical, engineering, and project/program management support for The Joint Staff J6 Command, Control, Communications and Computers/Cyber Directorate (C4/Cyber), and more specifically the Deputy Directorate for Cyber and Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Integration (DD C5I).  The mission of the Joint Staff J6 is to serve the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), develop C4/Cyber capability requirements and facilitate on behalf of the Joint Force in order to deliver a sustained information advantage, enable decision and action at the speed of the problem, and to ensure the warfighter receives jointly integrated and effective capabilities necessary to conduct operations.
 The Joint Staff J6 DDC5I provides engineering, assessment, training and analysis support in order to accomplish the mission responsibilities of the CJCS and the Joint Staff. In order to effectively accomplish integration responsibilities, Joint Staff J6 provides technical support to assessments and exercises to identify and resolve joint interoperability gaps, overlaps, and shortfalls that result in deficiencies in joint warfighting capabilities. The development of architectures, data and services, and standards are key enablers and criteria for assessment and integration.

  It will deliver the Joint Force a horizontally integrated portfolio of quality C4/Cyber systems and services that anticipate and satisfy their operational needs.

For planning purposes only, it is estimated that the requirement will call for 1,557,835 hours of effort over the life of the contracts.

The specific actions and/or tasks required will be identified on individual task orders issued under these contracts.

Travel will be required in support of this requirement.

However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this
combined synopsis/solicitation will be considered by the Government. A
determination by the Government not to compete this contract action based upon
responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The subject items
require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the source
previously approved by the Government for repair of these items is being
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in the NAVSUP Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This
brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your
company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can
be obtained at "https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps"
or by e-mailing the NAVSUP Buyer. If your request for source approval is
currently being evaluated at NAVSUP, submit with your offer a copy of the cover
letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which
fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document
previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will
not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation
of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time
and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in
time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may
continue based on Fleet support needs. For any questions concerning this notice,
contact the Buyer, Rachel Sprinkle at Rachel.sprinkle@navy.mil.

essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must
qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures
must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government
source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or
the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support
acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must

<DESC>Region 5 has been one of the front running regions to employ comparative monitoring LDAR investigations at chemical plants, refineries, and natural gas extraction plants.  The core violation found is the improper use of EPA Reference Method 21, and this is primarily determined using Flame Ionization Detectors from our Toxic Vapor Analyzers.  The numerous investigations conducted by Region 5 have yielded significant Hazardous Air Pollutant emission reductions through enforcement actions taken over the past 10 years.  The region is continuing to pursue LDAR enforcement in the energy extraction sector (i.e. natural gas extraction plants), consent decree follow-up inspections for refineries and chemical plants, and Part 63 MACT chemical plants.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice for notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  This is not a solicitation. The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate a sole source IDIQ contract for a 12 month base and (4) annual option years to obtain specialized laboratory services on an as needed basis, both STAT and Non-STAT Time Sensitive for the VA White River Junction (WRJ) located on 215 North Main Street, White River Junction, VT from the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center laboratory, (D-H) One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756.  Due to the remote location of the VA WRJ as well as the affiliate relationship between the VA WRJ and D-H, they are the only vendor that can provide the STAT and other time sensitive specialized laboratory testing services needed in this geographic location.  Since the intent is to procure this on a sole source basis, no solicitation will be posted to FedBizOps (FBO).  A Sources Sought Notice published to FBO on 10/9/2015 under #VA241-16-VD-0001, returned no results other than from the incumbent, D-H.  The solicitation will be provided to D-H, the sole source provider, on or about 11/23/2015. The applicable NAICS code is 621511.  The FSC/PSC is Q301.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302.1-1 Only One Responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.    
Interested persons may contact the Contracting Officer via email at Valerie.DeAngelis@va.gov regarding this procurement.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<p><br /> Charlotte, NC CBD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED:     The Government requires a total of 75,444 usable square feet of space.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, US Census Bureau (USCB) 2020 Census Questionnaire Assistance (CQA) Program, Program Management Office, intends to compete its requirement for the creation, test and operation of a multi-channel contact center in support of the 2020 CQA Program. The acquisition will be conducted using a multi-step process. STEP ONE will be conducted pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202, Advisory multi-step process also referred to as an advisory down-select in this notice. Instructions for STEP ONE are hereby published in this Pre-Solicitation Notice. STEP TWO will include the release of a final solicitation, receipt of full proposals, evaluation of proposals and contract award. <br /><br />STEP ONE
<p><br />This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice and STEP ONE of the multi-step 2020 CQA acquisition process. The USCB requests that potential offerors submit information that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors. A written mini-proposal submission is required in response to this notice. The information that must be submitted in response to this notice and the criteria that will allow the Government to advise offerors of their potential to be viable competitors in the 2020 CQA solicitation process is described further below in this notice.</p>
<p>The Offeror's mini-proposal shall be submitted via email no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on December 1, 2015 to the attention of Donna Cornish, Contract Specialist at acq.2020.CQA@census.gov. The email subject line shall read "[Company Name]-STEP ONE-2020 CQA". Sections of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the 2020 CQA multi-step acquisition are being released as attachments with this notice. The draft RFP sections contain sufficient information to permit potential offerors to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the 2020 CQA acquisition.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall submit their mini-proposals on Standard 8.5 x 11-inch paper using Microsoft Word, Times New Roman, no smaller than 12 point font, and with one inch margins. Potential offerors shall also submit a pdf copy of their mini proposals.</p>
<p>Mini - Proposal Submission: Information that must be submitted</p>
<p>The Government requests that five (5) Similar Experience citations relevant within the past seven (7) years, with the majority of the work being performed within the past five (5) years, be provided using Attachment L.1 Similar Experience Matrix Template. The potential offeror's mini-proposal shall include a two (2) page executive summary in addition to the similar experience citations provided. The executive summary shall contain information about the potential offeror's relevant corporate capabilities and qualifications. Each Similar Experience citation shall be no longer than two (2) pages and shall be submitted using Attachment L.1. The potential offeror's total response to STEP ONE shall not exceed twelve (12) pages.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria for Potential Offeror Viability</p>
<p>A potential offeror's viability will be evaluated based upon the potential offeror's description of Similar Experience that demonstrates an understanding and high level proposed resolution of the challenges associated with the 2020 CQA program. The USCB will ONLY evaluate the Prime Offeror's Similar Experience and performance, whether or not the Prime Offeror has already formed subcontracting partnerships for this effort. Similar experience and performance submitted by any subcontractors or teaming partners will not be evaluated as part of this advisory down-select process. However, the Prime Offeror's past ability to form and manage highly successful partnerships will be evaluated.</p>
<p>The USCB will assess the potential offeror's description of its qualifications and details of its specific similar experience performing work of the same and/or similar size, scope and complexity to the 2020 CQA program requirement.</p>
<p>For the purposes of STEP ONE, the USCB defines similar size, scope and complexity as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Size: Capabilities and experience with standing up and operating facilities, systems and infrastructure for a large scale (10K+ agent) customer service/support operations.<br />&bull; Scope: Capabilities and Experience with operating large scale (10K+ agent) customer service/support organizations including:<br />o Continuity of operations<br />o Functions associated with scheduling, reporting, quality monitoring, performance management<br />o Hiring and training required number of personnel in a time dictated by rapidly changing demand.<br />&bull; Complexity: Experience and ability to execute large scale (10K+ agent) customer service/support operations requiring:<br />o Ability to quickly scale operations up and down with trained and cleared staff<br />o Ability to manage highly variable arrival rates (unexpected surges)<br />o Compliance with the Wage Determination and Service Contract Act<br />o Considerable customizations and development efforts, including interfaces to clients' systems, and use of self-service tools and applications<br />o Management of operations involving multiple subcontractors<br />o Highly flexible management and technical processes and staff capable of adjusting priorities in light of quickly changing operational and regulatory environment<br />o Financial and invoicing systems capable of supporting various contract types (i.e. cost reimbursement, time and materials, labor hour and firm fixed price).</p>
<p>In its evaluation of the similar experience citations, the USCB will consider the totality of the submitted citations to determine the extent to which the potential offeror's experience matches the size, scope and complexity described above and in the attached draft RFP sections. In its evaluation, the USCB will consider a potential offeror's similar experience where the potential offeror performed as either the prime or as a subcontractor. The similar experience does not have to be limited to projects executed in support of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Notice to Potential Offerors</p>
<p>Potential offerors that the Government considers not to be viable competitors in the 2020 CQA solicitation process will receive, in writing, the general basis for the USCB's findings. In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), those potential offerors will also be advised that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition. However, potential offerors that make this business decision should carefully consider the cost, resources and time needed for their firm to continue pursuing the requirements.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of STEP ONE, the USCB will publish on its website (http://www.census.gov/about/business-opportunities/opportunities/vender-opps.html) the names of the Prime Contractors determined to be viable competitors in the 2020 CQA solicitation process as well as any other potential competitors that request that their identities be disclosed. Small businesses are encouraged to contact these companies for subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>STEP TWO</p>
<p>Planning</p>
<p>For STEP TWO, the USCB estimates the release of the final RFP in January 2016, with an award anticipated in June 2016.<br />&emsp;</p>

<p>The use of the MATOC will provide the Government with a construction product delivery method that can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, and can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules. The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) or more qualified Offerors, whose Proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price.</p>
<p>Task Orders will primarily address new construction, design-build or design-bid-build, general building renovation, road and airfield pavement repair, utility work to include water, sewer, electrical, and gas, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, and environmental remedial work. Project work may also include Force Protection type projects. This solicitation will cover the geographical area of Italy, which includes all U. S. Government Facilities throughout Italy.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a two-phase source selection process will be used to evaluate the contractors for award. Those contractors who are considered most qualified during Phase I (not to exceed five (5) contractors) will be requested to submit the proposal requirements for Phase II. Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the MATOC is not-to-exceed US$49,999,995.00 for the life of the contract, which will consist of one (1) base year period and four (4) one(1)-year option periods. The Contract will end upon completion of the five (5) one (1) year periods (if all options are exercised) or upon attainment of the US$49,999,995.00 capacity. Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values. There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year. The minimum guarantee shall be $5,000.00. This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (Base Period and Option Periods).</p>

In addition, there may be facilities or portions of facilities that require medical testing and/or immunization of Contractor employees, beyond basic OSHA requirements, before the employees are authorized to work in the controlled room, area, or facility.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Pre-solicitation Notice of a construction project for a new Hanscom Primary School, Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford, Massachusetts. The NAICS code for the work described below is 236220 with a project cost between $35M and $40M range. Work will begin during the Spring of 2016 and will extend over a 30 month period.
<p>The location of services to be performed under this contract shall be at Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford, Massachusetts. The project will consist of the demolition of the existing primary school and associated building(s), the construction of a new primary school, and associated site work. The new primary building will be constructed as an addition to a newly constructed middle school building. The size of this multi story structure will be approximately 80,000 sf. The project will utilize clear span or similar construction methods to allow easier reconfiguration to meet future educational needs. Near term flexibility and adaptability will be accommodated through the use of fully integrated acoustical-rated, operable wall partitions which contribute to the engineered acoustical performance of the building. The project will include 21st Century School concepts such as: learning neighborhoods, central hubs surrounded by learning studios, flex labs, information center annex, food service area, supply areas, specialist rooms, art room, music room, commons area for dining and social networking, therapy rooms, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage, administrative offices and other required areas for a fully functioning facility. The project also includes related infrastructure such as: parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, covered walkways, playgrounds and site improvements such as signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, exterior lighting and utilities. The facility will require enhanced commissioning upon completion to validate energy performance and must obtain LEED Silver certification. Phased construction will be required to accommodate this project without interrupting school operations. Temporary school facilities will be part of this project, as well as deconstructing and restoring the temporary site after the primary school construction has been completed.</p>
<p>Please note this is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about December 4, 2015. Documents will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>This is a Sources-Sought Notice for market research purposes only. Do not send proposals in response to this notice as it does not constitute a solicitation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Acquisition and Asset Management Division (AAMD), Procurement Branch, seeks information from firms interested in the removal, transport, and disposal of TB-infected, or possibly infected cattle, in Texas.
<p>APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) routinely conducts tuberculosis testing of dairy cattle whenever an animal from a herd has been found to be exposed to or infected with TB. As the disease may be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, once an animal has been confirmed positive by VS, the infected animal must be expediently removed from the herd. As such, we seek information from parties interested in the hauling and/or rendering/disposal of cattle in Texas that have tested positive. Services would include euthanizing, after which VS would collect tissue samples for further diagnostic testing under specific circumstances. Carcasses would then be promptly disposed. These services are required for all ages of cattle.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 311611, Animal (except Poultry) Slaughtering. The small business size standard is 500 employees. All interested parties in Texas are invited to submit a capabilities statement for acquisition planning purposes only. APHIS contemplates an indefinite-quantity contract with a base period and one option year. Firm-fixed-price task orders would be awarded for each requirement against the contract.</p>
<p>Electronic responses are preferred and telephonic requests for information will not be honored. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Information provided will not be used as a part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. Responses are due by 3 p.m., Central Standard Time, on December 18, 2015, to the attention of Jim Roloff, Contracting Officer, via e-mail to james.g.roloff@aphis.usda.gov or by fax to 612-336-3223.</p>

<DESC>AN/APX-118 and AN/PAX-123 Repair Market Survey Synopsis<br />Sources Sought for Procurement of Repair Service for the APX-123A (NSN 5841-01-628-5190) and APX-123 (5895-01-539-9151)<br />Class Code 59, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Components.<br />The sole source solicitation shall be for a firm fixed price 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to repair RT-1912A(C), RT-1912(C) Transponders, various sub-assemblies/modules and upgrade the RT-1912A(C) transponder to the RT -1912(C) transponder. This market survey is to locate additional sources for Depot Repair Support Services for the AN/APX-123A(V) and AN/APX-123(V) Transponder Sets. This will be an effort involving complete Depot Level repair down to the piece part level, and the contractor will have to overcome problems relating to repair parts obsolescence when problems of this nature arise. These tasks include repair of Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRU). The services to be provided to the government will not reflect total government repair needs, but only the repair needs that, which at any given point in time, are discovered to be above and beyond that which government depot facility can accomplish in the timeframe necessary, using government depot facilities and/or other levels of repair (AVIM, AVUM, SRA etc.). The following items have been identified as candidates for repair:
<p>Name/ Part Number/ NSN</p>
<p>Receiver/Transmitter Radar RT-1912A(C)<br />A3349792<br />5895-01-628-5190</p>

<p>The current source for complete Depot Level repair and upgrade requirements is BAE Systems.<br />Detailed Technical Data and drawings are not available from the Army. The LRUs and SRUs above are part of the AN/APX-123A(V) and AN/APX-123(V) Transponder Sets that are manufactured and repaired exclusively by BAE Systems, and therefore, there already exists provisioning, logistics and maintenance support in place. There is currently no detailed Technical Data for the AN/APX-123A(V) and AN/APX-123(V) Transponder Sets and sub-assemblies/modules available from the Army.

<p>If you have an interest in this intended upcoming solicitation, please provide a written response to the questions below and send your response to George Lambert at glambert@bop.gov. You are advised that providing responses to these questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Are you familiar with and does your company qualify for any of the programs identified under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19? If yes, please explain.

<p>2. What experience do you have in providing residential reentry services?</p>

<p>NOTICE:&nbsp; This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought to determine capability of potential sources and is for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of General Supplies &amp; Services (GSS), Retail Operations branch, is seeking sources for expendable tools and material in support of Government-owned Point of Use (POU) equipment utilized by production at three base locations: Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC), Oklahoma City, OK; Ogden Air Logistics Complex Hill Air Force Base (OO-ALC), Ogden, UT; and Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), Warner Robins, GA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The production technicians perform a variety of aircraft, propulsion, and commodities related maintenance and support work.&nbsp; Products, including non-aircraft shop support related items and Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE), common use items (i.e., drills, reamers, cutting tools, abrasives and common construction material) in support of the maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aircraft, engines, commodities and production related equipment.&nbsp; Automated Point of Use (POU) devices are utilized to issue the products.&nbsp; The POU is an automated device using Automated Point of Use Databases (APUDs) to track and update the usage of items contained within the various POU devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The production technicians on OC-ALC (Oklahoma City, OK) are located in thirty (30) different buildings across six square miles.&nbsp; There are currently twenty (20) non-automated storage areas or cribs, 251 automated POU locations, and 518 POU pieces of equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials.&nbsp; The production technicians on OO-ALC (Hill AFB, UT) are currently located throughout OO-ALC, but primarily in Building #225 and #265 and throughout WR-ALC in several different locations.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is issued for information and planning purposes only.&nbsp; This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).&nbsp; It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.&nbsp; Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this Sources Sought.&nbsp; GSA will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request.&nbsp; This FedBizOpps notice is announcement seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the products and or services as described herein.&nbsp; GSA is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.&nbsp; The information requested by this Sources Sought will be used with GSA to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.&nbsp; However, respondents submitting business information pursuant to this Sources Sought should consult 41 C.F.R., part 105-60 and other implementing regulations concerning the release of such information to third parties under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&nbsp; All information submitted by respondents that they consider confidential and not releasable to third parties outside of GSA, its employees, agents, consultants, and representatives, must be clearly and conspicuously so marked.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives:</p>
<p>GSA Retail Operations is requesting potential sources to provide products that fall within several categories that will be made available to GSA Retail Operations' government customers through automated Point of Use (POU) devices, non-automated storage areas or cribs and POU equipment with equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials.&nbsp; Vendors are challenged to provide most cost-effective approach that meets the following overall objectives.</p>
<p>Provide consigned products (stock) to GSA for distribution to its government customer's automated POU equipment, non-automated storage areas or cribs, and POU pieces of equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials.&nbsp; As such, each vendor for a specific product category will provide GSA consigned stock; ownership of the consigned stock will be passed to GSA when the stock is sold to GSA's government customer through GSA's Point of Sale (POS) system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each vendor, for their product category or categories, will be required to consign products to GSA, maintain min/max stock levels, source new products in its assigned category or categories, and provide Just-in-Time (JIT) delivery for products not stocked on-site.&nbsp; All vendors will communicate with GSA through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).&nbsp; As the stock levels in the automated POU, non-automated storage areas or cribs, and POU equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials drop to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor for their product category.&nbsp; GSA, along with its government customers, will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors can win one or multiple product categories; each category of product will cover multiple customer locations, OK-ALC, OO-ALC, and WR-ALC.&nbsp; Vendors are expected to leverage the volume of products across the enterprise locations to enable GSA to offer the GSA customers and the taxpayer significant cost savings.&nbsp; GSA is contemplating awarding separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract for each product category.&nbsp;</p>

Projects primarily include improvements to low-volume and low-speed roadways. Projects may be located in environmentally sensitive areas that necessitate context-sensitive construction techniques and processes. The predominant geographic area includes Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. These projects are primarily part of the Air Force Space Command OMAD program, the Refuge Road Program (RRP),) and to a lesser extent the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads Program (ERFO) and the Forest Land Access Program (FLAP).</p>
<p>The government anticipates individual task orders ranging from $50,000 to $10,000,000.00. Potential contractors will be required to demonstrate bonding capacity of up to $10,000,000 per task order with a yearly aggregate capacity of up to $20,000,000. Bonding will only be required for individual task orders. Request for Task Order Proposals will include Davis Bacon wage determinations and specific plans and specs for the project.</p>
<p>The first Task Order Request for Proposals (TO-RFP) will be issued simultaneously with the MATOC Request for Proposal.

Each contract awarded will consist of one base year and options to extend the contract for four additional one-year periods. The contract will have a maximum not-to-exceed five year total of $50 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders will be predominately for construction activities.</p>
<p>The scope of task orders may include, but are not limited to construction services including mobilization, contractor sampling and testing, production and placement of aggregate, roadway pulverization, roadway excavation, embankment construction, drainage improvements, placement of aggregate surface course, slope stabilization (MSE wall, gabions, etc.) minor asphalt surfacing and minor structural work.</p>
<p>This is a best value negotiated type procurement and evaluation factors for award are fully stated in the RFP which will be available as noted below. Evaluation factors will include Contract Team and Qualifications including organizational qualifications and key personnel, Contractor Past Performance, Financial capability and bonding capacity, location of Contractor headquarters, and QA/QC Program and Operations. The Government may award up to four contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, technical, and other factors considered.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction </span></strong>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, including immune-meditated rejection of transplanted organs and tissues. Translational studies using nonhuman primate models of pancreatic islet and solid organ transplantation are a key component of the Institute's efforts to increase long-term graft survival and life expectancy, and improve health-related quality of life for transplant recipients. NHP transplantation studies are essential to the design of scientifically sound and ethically acceptable clinical trials, due, in part, to the close approximation of the NHP immune system, genetics and physiology to those of humans.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for the maintenance, care, expansion and breeding of Government-owned specific pathogen-free (SPF) cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and Indian-origin rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) colonies. In addition, the requirement includes provision of up to approximately 300 research-aged SPF progeny a year to designated investigators within the NIAID and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Nonhuman Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group (NHPCSG). The goal of NHPCG, a multi-institution consortium, is to develop and test the efficacy of novel immune tolerance strategies in NHP models of islet and organ transplantation. Preclinical research conducted by the NHPCSG provides critical data required to move promising therapeutic agents from the laboratory into clinical trials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span></strong></p>
<p>The SPF research progeny from the rhesus and cynomolgus macaque colonies are primarily used for the NHPCSG consortium's research projects. Dedicated colonies allow for the establishment of directed breeding groups to provide progeny of known pedigree and degrees of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) disparity, which is critical to closely replicate clinical transplantation practices. In addition, knowledge of MHC disparity and relatedness between donors and recipients allows for better evaluation of the specific effects of novel regimens when using small experimental groups, as required with nonhuman primate studies. The majority of the colonies have been fully MHC genotyped or the MHC genotype is inferred by MHC-region microsatellite typing when the dam and sire MHC genotypes are known.</p>
<p>The NIAID plans to continue the support of the operation, maintenance and expansion of the NIAID macaque breeding colonies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project requirements</span></strong></p>
<p>The major scope and functions to be performed by the Contractor are to maintain and provide all aspects of care for Government-owned SPF Indian-origin rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and two country-origin cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) breeding colonies (herein referred to as rhesus macaque and cynomolgus macaque, respectively), including:<br />&bull; Maintenance, care, expansion (if required), and breeding of the colonies, including all aspects of animal husbandry and medical care.<br />&bull; Provision of up to approximately 240-300 research-aged SPF animals a year at full colony strength. (For purposes of this contract research-age is at least two (2) years and three (3) years for rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, respectively.) <br />&bull; Provision of genetic diversity analysis and planning.<br />&bull; Provision of MHC and/or MHC microsatellite typing in consultation with the Project Officer.<br />&bull; Provision of pedigree analysis. <br />&bull; Maintenance of a comprehensive animal and colony records database that shall be downloaded on a regular basis to the NIAID Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) ImmPort database.<br />&bull; Maintenance of continuous full AAALAC accreditation.</p>
<p><em>Additional scope considerations and definitions:</em><br />&bull; Assume an initial colony strength of approximately 1100 Indian-origin rhesus macaques and 420 Indonesian-origin and 330 Mauritius-origin cynomolgus macaques; <br />&bull; Provision of appropriate housing for the approximate 1850 animals, assuming 55 social groups of between 10 - 70 animals each, and the capability to increase housing as the colonies' sizes increase to enable provision of the approximate 240-300 research-aged animals each year. <br />&bull; Provision of sufficient SPF clinical facilities.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall be financially responsible for all mortalities beyond 10% annually in each individual colony. <br />&bull; For the purpose of this contract SPF is defined as negative for the following viruses: Simian Herpes B virus (Cercopithencine herpesvirus-1, hereafter referred to as B virus), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Type D Simian Retroviruses (SRV), and Simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV-1). Fully SPF is defined as a colony negative for, and with no exposure to, all four viruses for greater than or equal to five (5) years.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance</span></strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will begin around June, 2017 and continue for seven years.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Command, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking information regarding Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) to be incorporated in Ground Control Systems (GCS) for the RQ-7B Shadow Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) project. CDS require multiple levels of approvals before they are authorized for use to connect disparate security domains within Department of Defense and Naval Weapons Systems. The process of approval includes the candidate CDS device's addition to the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) Baseline, which requires thorough testing by the National Security Agency (NSA). Second, a UCDMO approved CDS must then be validated and endorsed by the Navy Cross Domain Solutions Office (NCDSO). After validation and endorsement of the CDS by the NCDSO, it must then be accredited by the Defense Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG) per individual use case for a specific use.<br />&nbsp;
<p>CDS connect disparate security domains and stream Full Motion Video (FMV) and metadata from unclassified UASs to classified (SECRET) tactical host networks. The CDS provides functionality for one-way dataflow from an unclassified to a classified domain while transferring FMV and telemetry metadata from a GCS, and provide analytical, trans-coding, storage, and data distribution functionality to other accredited information systems. Furthermore only CDS currently on the UCDMO baseline that is DSAWG approved to stream said data. Due to the current state of development of the RQ-7B, all certification costs would be the responsibility of the potential contractor. However, if you believe you have a CDS that already meets the certifications requirement you are asked to provide that information to NAWCAD.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking industry input to assist in identifying CDS units that might meet the requirements described above. Please note that the Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this RFI. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>In response to this RFI, respondents shall submit written responses, not-to-exceed ten (10) pages in length via electronic mail. Respondents should include product specifications with submission and proof of certifications. Product specification, sketches, or listings of authorized distributors do not to count as part of the page count. The Government is interested in receiving vendors' price lists for items they believe meet the need in this RFI. Supplying price data does not imply a contractual obligation and must be provided as a separate document, marked as PRICE DATA.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. All information received in response to this RFI shall be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207, Handling Proposals and Information. The Government does utilize Contractor Support Staff for assisting in all aspects of its acquisition process, and each of those individuals does have signed non-disclosure statements on file as condition of their employment. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.</p>
<p>Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated solicitation that may be issued. Information provided in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website: www.fbo.gov. It is the potential vendor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.</p>

These three supporting programs provide a balanced approach to achieving overall spectrum management for the DON.  These programs require technical support to review and analyze various Joint, National, Allied, and International policies, regulations and procedures, research and evaluate spectrum requirements, and identify, analyze, and recommend measures to resolve radio frequency interference and encroachment problems.
  Technical support of the spectrum management program, as a whole, requires the resources essential to execute the three program areas.

Your response to this Sources Sought Notice will be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor responses to this announcement.
  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

The expected NAICS code for this procurement is 541690.  Any information submitted is voluntary.
It is requested that interested firms submit:
(1) The name, address, phone number, email address, and CAGE code of the firm;

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
<p>In reaction to prompt total-body ionizing radiation with a dose range of 0.5 to 10 Gy (photons), the typical symptoms of radiation exposure in humans include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion . The duration of initial or prodromal symptoms and the latent phase of radiation syndrome is anywhere from 1 h to 2 weeks. Without appropriate medical care, the median lethal dose of radiation, the LD50/60 (the dose that kills 50% of the exposed population within 60 days after exposure), is estimated to be 4.5 Gy . However, the likelihood of survival can be significantly increased with appropriate aggressive medical intervention and care . <br />The Radiation Biodosimetry Point of Care (POC) Triage Test is designed to be administered by a person with little or no medical training in an assembly center, field hospital, tent, emergency room or triage station and determine whether an individual has absorbed a dose of 2 Gy or greater. The intent of this assay is to separate the individuals with irradiation-related medical needs from the "concerned citizens" who do not need specific treatment. <br />The objective of this proposed request for services and subsequent test acquisition is to:<br />Acquire FDA approved/cleared Radiation Biodosimetry POC Test systems including acquisition of sufficient quantities of the tests, reagents, instruments and associated consumables to ensure a level of national readiness that does not presently exist.<br />As part of delivering the FDA approved/cleared Radiation Biodosimetry POC Test systems the Offeror may include the following efforts:<br />1. Performance of the formal Validation of the Radiation Biodosimetry POC Test system in preparation for regulatory filing.<br />2. Provide services that support filing sufficient data to request Emergency Use Authorization of the Radiation Biodosimetry HT Test system.<br />3.

A dewatering system for the pump station excavation may be required. Unwatering of excavations, surface water control and flood protection measures will be required during construction. In addition, placement of select embankment properly benched and compacted to backfill excavated areas, to widen a portion of the levee and to achieve finish grades on the project will be required.</p>
<p>The pump station will consist of construction of an H-pile founded reinforced concrete structure located near the landside toe of the existing levee. The pump station will contain intake and sump chambers with trash screens, 3 axial flow submersible pumps, and 3 steel discharge pipes exiting the back of the structure, which cross up, over and down the levee and terminate with 3 saxophone shape discharges at the ends of the pipe on the riverside downstream of the existing riverside levee toe. The pump station will contain appurtenances such as handrail, ladders, bollards, curb, steps, grating, etc. A modular electrical building, located at the operating floor, with a motor control center containing including a programmable logic control system and operator interface panel will be required. As previously noted, installation of Contractor-designed mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls which extend from the pump station to the entrance channel will be required.</p>
<p>Construction of gravel access roads and parking area at the pump station will be required. Installation of geotextile, bedding material and riprap will be required at the entrance and exit channels and on bank slopes. Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) for drainage will be required at various locations.</p>
<p>Sampling and field and lab testing of backfill placement for density, moisture, grain size, etc. will be required by the construction contractor. Sampling and field and lab testing of concrete for slump, compressive strength, etc. will be required by the construction contractor.</p>
<p>Extensive coordination with two major utilities, Ameren Missouri and Public Water Supply District No. 2 of St. Charles County will be required throughout the duration of construction.</p>

SURGICAL PACKS: 
VA Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is seeking information on industry best practices for the supply of "Surgical Packs" to VA hospitals enterprise-wide.  There are 153 hospitals and various support facilities, and the configuration of the surgical packs will not only vary from hospital to hospital, but  may vary within each specific hospital based on the type of surgeries performed and in some cases the preference of the medical staff.  Due to the variances in required packs, volume necessary to facilitate all hospitals and support facilities, breadth of coverage, and disposal/replenishment, we are seeking recommendations on best method(s) for achieving our objective.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) awarded a sole source contract to Integrated Security Solutions for urgent security equipment maintenance, repair, and replacement of existing equipment. This was awarded as a sole source due to the urgent nature. Accordingly, due to the proximity to the Mexican border the agency was at risk of vandalism, disaster, and terror attacks. Falcon Dam and Falcon Power Plant are located on the border adjacent to the Mexican town of Nuevo Guerrero which is one of the areas used and frequented by drug cartels. Numerous deadly gun battles have been fought in Nuevo Guerrero within several hundred yards of the facility and have been witnessed from Falcon Dam and the Falcon Power Plant. One danger that IBWC personnel face at Falcon is criminals crossing to the US side on IBWC property as they try to flee from Mexican Federal forces or cartel members. Our security personnel have caught several persons using our property to cross from Mexico into the United States. Some of these persons have been armed with various weapons

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry partnering to accelerate the development of technologies that will enable the Warfighter to be more effective, efficient and lethal.</p>
<p>The Systems Adaptive Red Team /Technical Support and Operational Analysis (ART/TSOA) invites industry, academia, individuals, and laboratories to submit technology demonstration papers addressing innovative technologies and capabilities that can be used in challenging environments:</p>
<p>Physical (Terrain -Natural &amp; Urban) <br />Electronic (Frequency Congestion &amp; Overload) <br />Contested (Electronic Interference, Cyber Attacks, &amp; CBRNE)</p>
<p>The ART team supports the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) to improve Warfighter maneuver, survivability and lethality. The ART team identifies potential vulnerabilities in emerging technologies including performance degradation in contested environments, interoperability, adaptability and training/ease of use through live experiment venues.</p>
<p>After reviewing the technology demonstration paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their capabilities in an ART/TSOA assessment venue in which we evaluate the capability as applied to the Warfighter, its technical limitations and vulnerabilities. These assessments will be held quarterly at various venues to include, but not limited to, Camp Roberts Army National Guard Base, Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA, Ft. Hood, TX, Fort AP Hill, VA, Ft. Lewis, WA, Camp Atterbury, IN, Stennis, MS and Port Canaveral, FL through 31 December 2016. These assessments will provide the submitter an opportunity to interact with the Warfighter, the DoD Science and Technology community, academia, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Theatre Special Operations Commands (TSOCs)and other Federal Agencies for the purpose of assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on missions and capabilities.</p>
<p>Technology Demonstration papers shall be submitted electronically to email address: usarmy.belvoir.rdecom-cerdec.mbx.nvesd-art-tsoa-submissions@mail.mil. The subject line of the email must indicate ART/TSOA, followed by the submitting organization's name. This RFI is effective through 31 December 2016. Technology demonstration papers may be submitted at any time during the effective periods but specific event cut-off dates are listed below.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>(1) Background: The ART/TSOA conducts quarterly assessments funded by ASA(ALT) to support the vulnerability identification and system limitation in contested environments for emerging capabilities in an operationally relevant venue. These assessments are conducted with representatives from Government Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia, and industry. The assessments provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support military capability gaps and high priority mission deficiencies. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between academia, Government, and industry and supports identification, assessment, and dissemination of emerging and mature technology information and the acceleration of delivering capabilities to the Warfighters and those they support. The assessment results are reported back to the program director on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>(2) Assessment Focus and Submission Timeline: Four ART / TSOA assessments will be conducted in February 2016, May 2016, August 2016 and December 2016. Off-cycle assessments (outside of the 4 quarterly TSOA's) may be conducted in April, July and October 2016. Specific focus areas outlined below for ART/TSOA 16-3 and off-cycles events. Specific focus areas listed below for ART/TSOA 16-3, Off-Cycle 1, and Off-Cycle 3 does not mean every technology selected will be required to fit the desired focus area. If a specific focus area is not listed all technologies will be selected based on ART main focus areas listed below in section B4.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - New Jersey intends to award a sole source procurement for Seeburger Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) Adapter Software Renewal and Annual Maintenance, to Seeburger, Inc, 1230 Peachtree Street NE, Suite 1020, Atlanta, GA. Product Director Acquisition, Logistics and Technology Enterprise and Services (PD ALTESS) in support the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) requires renewal support for Seeburger SFTP Adapter Software and annual maintenance which provides uninterrupted 24x7 operation capabilities. These brand name systems are required to ensure maximum compatibility with the LMP infrastructure. An effort to re-tool to a different product would be of significant magnitude and expense. Due to the unique capability set and previous investments in the Seeburger software, the procurement of continuing support is required. The software is required for production, development and test network environments and must match the technologies currently in use in the LMP program. <br />Procurement of this action will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR 13.106(b)(1), for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. <br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541519 with a size standard of $27.5M. This notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive quotations and no Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued for competitive quotes. The Government will not be responsible for any cost associated with responses. Phone calls will not be accepted. The point of contact for this action is Ms. Emelda Long, emelda.long.civ@mail.mil. Interested parties may express their interest and provide capability statements by 4:00 PM EDT on 30 November 2015. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The anticipated award date is December 1, 2015. Award will be negotiated with AUTOMIC SOFTWARE, INC., 14475 NE 24th ST, SUITE 210, BELLEVUE, WA, 98007-3739 for a period of one year with an estimated value of $18,730.00.

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Ft. Myers, FL that will be expiring December 13, 2019. The Government intends to negotiate a lease reduction of 5,937 ANSI BOMA Office Area square feet (ABOA) based on economic, mission, and other factors. The remaining space will be 18,326 ABOA. The Government will consider alternative space only if economical and other factors are supportive. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, occupancy schedule, and quality of space.

<DESC>The Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) is the single logistics center for the Coast Guard surface fleet, providing engineering, maintenance, supply, and technical information services to Coast Guard cutters and boats stationed throughout the United States. The SFLC purchases a wide variety of marine goods and services and we are committed to small business participation in our acquisition programs to support the fleet. The SFLC posts its upcoming forecast of opportunities on the Acquisition Planning Forecast System (AFPS), which is a portal for small business vendors to view projections of all anticipated opportunities estimated to exceed $150,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with the SFLC or perform part of the effort through subcontracts. APFS identifies all upcoming forecasted, but not necessarily funded, opportunities at http://apfs.dhs.gov/.
<p>We hope that APFS will assist you in doing business with SFLC. By helping vendors identify procurement opportunities as early in the acquisition process as possible, we hope to improve communication with industry and assist the small business community with its marketing efforts. Vendors seeking to track upcoming SFLC opportunities may register to be notified when anticipated opportunities are published to APFS. APFS is continually updated and informs the public of our projected requirements estimated to exceed $150,000, early in the process. Information on this site is organized in a manner to permit various data sorts, and the individual items include descriptions of required supplies or services and program points-of-contact (POC's) so that vendors can call and inquire about the specific program needs prior to formal solicitations being released. Marketing efforts are most effectively conducted with the Program Offices, since they originate the requirement and prepare its associated market research report. Vendors are encouraged to have their technical experts communicate with our technical personnel, as their knowledge of advances in technology and the firm's capabilities are much more helpful to us than generic sales presentations.</p>

The SFLC posts its upcoming forecast of opportunities on the Acquisition Planning Forecast System (AFPS), which is a portal for small business vendors to view projections of all anticipated opportunities estimated to exceed $150,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with the SFLC or perform part of the effort through subcontracts. APFS identifies all upcoming forecasted, but not necessarily funded, opportunities at http://apfs.dhs.gov/.
<p>We hope that APFS will assist you in doing business with SFLC. By helping vendors identify procurement opportunities as early in the acquisition process as possible, we hope to improve communication with industry and assist the small business community with its marketing efforts. Vendors seeking to track upcoming SFLC opportunities may register to be notified when anticipated opportunities are published to APFS. APFS is continually updated and informs the public of our projected requirements estimated to exceed $150,000, early in the process. Information on this site is organized in a manner to permit various data sorts, and the individual items include descriptions of required supplies or services and program points-of-contact (POC's) so that vendors can call and inquire about the specific program needs prior to formal solicitations being released. Marketing efforts are most effectively conducted with the Program Offices, since they originate the requirement and prepare its associated market research report. Vendors are encouraged to have their technical experts communicate with our technical personnel, as their knowledge of advances in technology and the firm's capabilities are much more helpful to us than generic sales presentations.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>

Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate "Key Personnel" and "Past Performance" to determine if a quote is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Key Personnel</strong><br />Key personnel are defined as the quoter's proposed employees responsible for providing regular ASL Interpreting Services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters shall submit a one-page resume for all individuals proposed as key personnel.</span></strong> Interpreters shall have a minimum of three years continuous experience in performing similar interpreting services in a diverse office environment.</p>
<p>The Key Personnel factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. In order to receive an "acceptable" rating, Quoters must demonstrate that all key personnel proposed have sufficient relevant experience to indicate they have the knowledge and capability to successfully perform their assigned roles. If proposed key personnel are replaced during the execution of this project, replacement personnel must have equal or better qualifications as those proposed and must be approved by the Contracting Officer before they perform work. (See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>

Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Exam Table Paper. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Exam Table Paper products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Exam Table Paper.  All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered.  If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item.  Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Exam Table Paper will be established approximately December 2015 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately January 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Exam Table Paper. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Table Paper.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Table Paper. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $991,440. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 92.52% ($917,269) of the total volume in sales ($991,440). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission.<br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).&nbsp;<strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Elastic Bandages. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Elastic Bandages products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Elastic Bandages. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Elastic Bandages will be established approximately April 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Elastic Bandages. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Elastic Bandages.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Elastic Bandages. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,115,720.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eight items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 80% ($893,202.00) of the total volume in sales ($1,115,720.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission.<br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).<br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<DESC>THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IS FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />This announcement constitutes the only Synopsis/Solicitation notice; the written solicitation is attached and quotes are being requested. Solicitation number W912LC-16-T-5000 is being issued as a REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-83 effective 1 November 2015. All applicable provisions and clauses are included in the actual solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110, and the small business size standard is $32.5 Million. The Government intends to issue multiple firm fixed priced Blanket Purchase Agreements for reoccurring requirement of lodging during the monthly Unit Training Assembly in accordance with the attached Statement of Need. Please reference solicitation # W912LC-16-T-5000 on all correspondence. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the response date. Funds are currently available. Quotations must provide valid pricing for the fiscal year (1 Oct to 30 September) and pricing shall be within the GSA established per diem rates. (http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/1001200).
<p><br />This lodging requirement consists of establishing BPAs for a period of one (1) year, with up to four (4) additional follow-on years, from the date of award to hotels in the local area via issuance of monthly BPA Call Orders that will be competed among the selected BPA vendors.</p>
<p>Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements and re-negotiation of terms and conditions. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All BPA Call Orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to include documentation that showcases the amenities their property offers.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Commission is an independent agency that has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Initially, that oversight consisted primarily of conducting public, on-the-record hearings concerning proposed rate, mail classification or major service changes, and recommending decisions for action by the postal Governors.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) enacted on December 20, 2006, significantly strengthened the Commission's authority to serve as a counterbalance to new flexibility granted to the Postal Service in setting postal rates. The Act requires the Commission to develop and maintain regulations for a modern system of rate regulation, consult with the Postal Service on delivery service standards and performance measures, consult with the Department of State on international postal policies, prevent cross-subsidization of competitive products by market products or other anticompetitive postal practices, promote transparency and accountability, and adjudicate complaints.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.25in; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The law also assigns new and continuing oversight responsibilities to the PRC, including annual determinations of Postal Service compliance with applicable laws, development of accounting practices and procedures for the Postal Service, review of the cost of the Universal Service Obligation, and assurance of transparency through periodic reports. New enforcement tools include subpoena power, authority to direct the Postal Service to adjust rates and to take other remedial actions, and levying fines in cases of deliberate noncompliance with applicable postal laws.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Exam Table Paper. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Exam Table Paper products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Exam Table Paper.  All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered.  If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item.  Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Exam Table Paper will be established approximately April 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Exam Table Paper. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Table Paper.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Table Paper. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $991,440. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 92.52% ($917,269) of the total volume in sales ($991,440). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission.<br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).&nbsp;<strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><br /></strong>1.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for.

See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br /><br />5.	<strong>Vendor offered products should be TAA compliant.

For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Exam Table Paper.  All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.  In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered.  If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item.  Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA.  Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Exam Table Paper will be established approximately March 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately April 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Exam Table Paper. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Exam Table Paper.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Exam Table Paper. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $991,440. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 92.52% ($917,269) of the total volume in sales ($991,440). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission.<br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).&nbsp;<strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C.

<p><br />Response Required:<br />Any eligible MSI interested in submitting a proposal for financial assistance for applied research and related STEM activities on the Sub-Program Priority Areas and Research Needs listed below must respond with a Letter of Interest by November 30, 2015. All letters must be submitted by email to pamela.boyd@srs.gov. The following must be included in the Letter of Interest:</p>
<p>Institution Name:<br />Institutional Accreditation (Accrediting Agency):<br />Sub-program Priority Area (PA) and Research Need (RN) Category of Proposed Research (List Below):<br />Proposed Title:</p>
<p>Eligible institutions that respond with a Letter of Interest will be provided with a Request for Proposal. Expressions of Interest are to be addressed by email to the Point of Contact identified in this notice.</p>
<p>This EOI is a "Sources Sought" notice only for eligible institutions interested in submitting proposals for financial assistance for applied research and related activities in STEM fields that support defined DOE-EM research and development needs.</p>
<p><br />Description:<br />The following program descriptions are offered to provide more in-depth information on STEM areas of interest to the Office of Environmental Management. Specific areas of research interest are identified in each Sub-Program Priority Areas and Research Needs list.</p>
<p>1. Site Restoration<br />Program Website: http://energy.gov/em/services/site-facility-restoration<br /><br />The mission of the Site Restoration program is to provide integration, planning and analysis for all soil and groundwater remediation, deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) and facility engineering.</p>
<p>The Site Restoration subprograms and their objectives follow: <br /><br />Soil and Groundwater<br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the largest groundwater and soil remediation effort in the world. The inventory at the DOE sites includes 6.5 trillion liters of contaminated groundwater, an amount equal to about four times the daily U.S. water consumption, and 40 million cubic meters of soil and debris contaminated with radionuclides, metals, and organics. At the large sites such as Hanford (Richland, WA), Savannah River (Aiken, SC), and Oak Ridge (Oak Ridge, TN), the Office of Soil and Groundwater Remediation has conducted research and demonstration projects to test new technologies and remediation approaches. These initiatives are developing remediation alternatives ranging from active engineered systems to natural attenuation to address a variety of DOE-EM contaminants. They are being integrated into a systems-based, risk-informed, remediation framework that is being applied across the DOE-EM complex.</p>
<p>R&amp;D can include characterization and monitoring; stabilization, remediation and processing; and modeling, visualization and analysis. The goal of research and technology development activities is to deliver approaches and technologies from highly leveraged and strategic investments that maximize the reduction of risk and life-cycle cleanup costs.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Attenuation Based Remedies for the Subsurface<br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to solutions to address subsurface metal and radionuclide contamination and recalcitrant organics<br />C1: Research should complement or extend the work of the Attenuation Based Remedies (ABRS) for the Subsurface Applied Field Research Initiative (AFRI), located at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina for (http://energy.gov/em/attenuation-based-remedies-subsurface-applied-field-research-initiative-abrs-afri)</p>
<p>PA2: Deep Vadose Zone<br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to improved characterization, remediation, monitoring, and prediction for the deep vadose zone<br />C2: Research should complement or extend the work of the Deep Vadose Zone AFRI, located on the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington (http://www.pnl.gov/arm-em32/)</p>
<p>PA3: Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants<br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the control of the flux of contaminants in soil and water environments<br />C3: Research should complement or extend the work of the Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants (ROMIC) AFRI, based at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that focuses on protecting surface water, groundwater, and ecological receptors (http://www.esd.ornl.gov/romic_afrc/index.shtml)</p>
<p><br />Deactivation &amp; Decommissioning<br />Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) is the process of taking an active/excess/abandoned facility to a final disposition end state. Because of residual radioactivity, other hazardous constituents, and the physical condition of EM's facilities, D&amp;D presents unique hazards that must be addressed from a safety, programmatic, environmental, and technological standpoint. The general D&amp;D process applies to all facilities across the EM complex. The D&amp;D function with the Office of D&amp;D and Facility Engineering focusses on innovative applications and timely insertion of existing commercially available technologies, processes and hardware to identify and address D&amp;D risks and challenges. The program supports the development of informed facility D&amp;D strategy such as In-Situ Decommissioning, enhanced verifiability of the efficacy of D&amp;D operations, increased productivity and personnel safety of D&amp;D operation, facilitation of acceptable facility end-states, and independent verification.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>

<p>2. Tank Waste<br />Program Website: http://energy.gov/em/services/waste-management/tank-waste-and-waste-processing</p>
<p>EM is dedicated to safely disposing of waste and seeks cost effective and environmentally responsible project execution methods. EM offices that focus on waste management provide leadership in planning and executing EM programs for the storage, retrieval, pretreatment, treatment, and final preparation of nuclear materials for disposal and tank closure planning.</p>
<p>Tank Waste and Waste Processing <br />The Department has approximately 88 million gallons of liquid waste stored in underground tanks and approximately 4,000 cubic meters of solid waste derived from the liquids stored in bins. The current DOE estimated cost for retrieval, treatment and disposal of this waste exceeds $50 billion to be spent over several decades. The highly radioactive portion of this waste, located at the Hanford Site, Idaho National Laboratory, and Savannah River Site, must be treated, immobilized, and prepared for shipment to a waste repository. Efforts currently focus on improving pre-treatment to reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed, retrieval technologies, vitrification performance, and breakthrough immobilization technologies.</p>

<p><br />Description:<br />The following program descriptions are offered to provide more in-depth information on STEM areas of interest to the Office of Environmental Management. Specific areas of research interest are identified in each Sub-Program Priority Areas and Research Needs list.</p>
<p>1. Site Restoration<br />Program Website: http://energy.gov/em/services/site-facility-restoration<br /><br />The mission of the Site Restoration program is to provide integration, planning and analysis for all soil and groundwater remediation, deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) and facility engineering.</p>
<p>The Site Restoration subprograms and their objectives follow: <br /><br />Soil and Groundwater<br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the largest groundwater and soil remediation effort in the world. The inventory at the DOE sites includes 6.5 trillion liters of contaminated groundwater, an amount equal to about four times the daily U.S. water consumption, and 40 million cubic meters of soil and debris contaminated with radionuclides, metals, and organics. At the large sites such as Hanford (Richland, WA), Savannah River (Aiken, SC), and Oak Ridge (Oak Ridge, TN), the Office of Soil and Groundwater Remediation has conducted research and demonstration projects to test new technologies and remediation approaches. These initiatives are developing remediation alternatives ranging from active engineered systems to natural attenuation to address a variety of DOE-EM contaminants. They are being integrated into a systems-based, risk-informed, remediation framework that is being applied across the DOE-EM complex.</p>
<p>R&amp;D can include characterization and monitoring; stabilization, remediation and processing; and modeling, visualization and analysis. The goal of research and technology development activities is to deliver approaches and technologies from highly leveraged and strategic investments that maximize the reduction of risk and life-cycle cleanup costs.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Attenuation Based Remedies for the Subsurface<br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to solutions to address subsurface metal and radionuclide contamination and recalcitrant organics<br />C1: Research should complement or extend the work of the Attenuation Based Remedies (ABRS) for the Subsurface Applied Field Research Initiative (AFRI), located at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina for (http://energy.gov/em/attenuation-based-remedies-subsurface-applied-field-research-initiative-abrs-afri)</p>
<p>PA2: Deep Vadose Zone<br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to improved characterization, remediation, monitoring, and prediction for the deep vadose zone<br />C2: Research should complement or extend the work of the Deep Vadose Zone AFRI, located on the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington (http://www.pnl.gov/arm-em32/)</p>
<p>PA3: Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants<br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the control of the flux of contaminants in soil and water environments<br />C3: Research should complement or extend the work of the Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants (ROMIC) AFRI, based at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that focuses on protecting surface water, groundwater, and ecological receptors (http://www.esd.ornl.gov/romic_afrc/index.shtml)</p>
<p><br />Deactivation &amp; Decommissioning<br />Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) is the process of taking an active/excess/abandoned facility to a final disposition end state. Because of residual radioactivity, other hazardous constituents, and the physical condition of EM's facilities, D&amp;D presents unique hazards that must be addressed from a safety, programmatic, environmental, and technological standpoint. The general D&amp;D process applies to all facilities across the EM complex. The D&amp;D function with the Office of D&amp;D and Facility Engineering focusses on innovative applications and timely insertion of existing commercially available technologies, processes and hardware to identify and address D&amp;D risks and challenges. The program supports the development of informed facility D&amp;D strategy such as In-Situ Decommissioning, enhanced verifiability of the efficacy of D&amp;D operations, increased productivity and personnel safety of D&amp;D operation, facilitation of acceptable facility end-states, and independent verification.</p>

<DESC>*This special notice was originally posted on 14 January 2015 it is being modified to correct the solicitation number to W9127815R0013.* <br>  <br>  <br> The solicitation will be available for download on 21 JAN 2015. The estimated cost of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The contracting officer is Mr Carl Wade.  <br>    <br>  Description of Work:  <br>  Complete a small concrete building shell and provide phase renovation of a two-story BSL Laboratory to include partition walls, HVAC, windows, elevator installation, plumbing, stairs, electrical, lighting, demolition and removal of some sidewalks.  Must complete under a very aggressive time schedule and very rigid phasing plan.  Some materials must be procured in the United States.  <br>    <br>  Work will require extensive knowledge of the functional operation of medical research facilities, relating to the efficient use of the facility, equipment, facility support systems especially HVAC and electrical systems for laboratories, and building structures. Since the research facilities will remain in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the laboratories and support facilities, and will be required to comply with regulatory requirements of accrediting bodies such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The facilities to be covered by the intended contract include Bio-safety Levels (BSL)-2 and 3 research laboratories and laboratory support functions related to testing for human bacteriologic, viral, and parasitic pathogens.   <br>    <br>  The performing contractor's personnel will be required to meet security and health screening requirements. In addition, there may be facilities or portions of facilities that require medical testing and/or immunization of Contractor employees, beyond basic OSHA requirements, before the employees are authorized to work in the controlled room, area, or facility. This requirement may be due to the containment requirements in bioresearch laboratories, the potential for exposure of workers to toxins or communicable diseases, etc.   <br>    <br>  Note No. 1:  All prospective contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers must be registered in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) before they will be allowed to download solicitation information.

It is therefore the Contractor's responsibility to monitor the website daily for the solicitation to be posted, and for any posted changes or amendments to this solicitation.  The plans and specifications and all notifications of changes to this solicitation shall only be made through this posting and modifications hereto.
