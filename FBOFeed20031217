<DESC>USAID/India is seeking proposals from qualified, responsible U. S. organizations interested in undertaking a Performance-Based ‘Management Contract’ under the Disaster Management Support (DMS) Project in India. To establish a Management Contractor whose goal is to help the USAID & GOI improve systems of disaster management at the national, state and local levels in India.  These systems will address not only natural disasters, but also man-made emergencies. 

The DMS Project will provide USAID/India with a linked set of mutually supportive activities that address the issues articulated above and contribute toward achieving the targeted results. The purpose of the DMS Project is to increase capacity in the Indian public and private sectors in all phases of the disaster cycle which will reduce vulnerability to disasters in high-risk areas.  Each component of the DMS Project will contribute through a holistic framework to the development of improved systems for disaster management in India. 

Major components of the DMS Project are:
1.Capacity Building in the Public Sector will focus on the enhancement of the capacities of the MHA to support state and local government entities, and other key related governmental units to ensure that disaster managers and decision makers will have the tools needed to prepare for, respond to, and develop plans for long-term mitigation of disasters. Some major sub-components are:

Incident Command System (ICS) for the improvement of on-site disaster response.   The U. S. Forest Service (USFS) is assisting the MHA to incorporate elements of the U. S. Incident Command System into the Indian disaster management system.  
Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) to provide technical assistance for design of EOCs, development of “Standard Operating Procedures” and preparation of appropriate lists of equipment.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide technical assistance for this sub-component. 

	Search and Rescue (SAR) to provide technical assistance and training to strengthen the capabilities of search and rescue (SAR) units and medical first response (MFR) at selected state and local levels.  FEMA will provide some assistance on development of a national urban search and rescue system. Other elements will be elaborated with the MHA.

(2) The Climate Forecasting Systems component is focused on reducing vulnerability to hydro-meteorological disasters resulting from extreme climate events such as floods, cyclones, droughts.  

(3) The Disaster Initiatives (DI) component will provide grant funds to organizations for innovative, cutting-edge, catalytic initiatives that can be used as models for replication by other organizations or expanded to new sites in disaster prone areas of the country.  

Each component of the DMS Project will contribute through a holistic framework to the development of improved systems for disaster management in India.

Management Contractor (MC) shall assist with the design and planning of certain DMS components; directly implement specific DMS activities; administer a grant program; and provide coordination and limited space and logistical support to DMS activities implemented by various USG agencies.

<DESC>Market Survey Federal Aviation Administration  Airman Testing Standards, AFS-630 Development and Revision of Airman Knowledge Training Handbooks QUALIFIED VENDORS LIST NOTE:  If you are getting notice of this requirement any place other than www.asu.faa.gov/Contracting Opportunities you may not have the complete document.  You MUST download information from the www.asu.faa.gov/ to have all information. General Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to issue a Qualified Vendors List  (QVL) for FAA Development and Revision of Airman Knowledge Training Handbooks.  A QVL is a list of service or product providers who have had their products or services examined, or evaluated and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements.  QVLs are intended as a mechanism to establish a pool of qualified vendors, any of which the FAA would be satisfied with the products delivered or services performed.  Pre-screening vendors allows only those most qualified contractors to perform a particular service or provide a particular product during a specific period.  The information contained herein is the Market Survey that will start the process of determining possible sources for this requirement, and will be used to down select to a manageable number of only the top vendors as determined by the evaluation criteria listed below.  It will be followed by the issuance of a formal request for proposal with full QVL qualifications requirements to only those potential offerors that are determined to be the top 6 found to be acceptable after a general review of information and data provided during the market survey phase of the procurement.  This requirement is open to large and small businesses and is not set-aside for Small, or Socially and Economically Disadvantages Businesses (SEDBs), but if two or more SEDBs are found technically acceptable, the final QVL make up will have approximately 25 percent SEDB participation.   The FAA expects to have the QVL in place by February 1, 2004, the initial QVL period will be 5 years.  The task under the QVL will be awarded based upon competition among the list holders using completion scope type tasks.  Tasks may be issued on a best value basis or price competitive basis depending on the requirement.  On price-based requirements, the QVL Contractors will bid the requirement firm-fixed-price completion format. For tasks processed using best value procedures, an evaluation process for each task will be used to determine the best value; technical excellence, delivery, and price will be evaluated to determine the best value. Quality and delivery are critical to the FAA and poor performance on technical issues (having to return deliverables back to the vendor for reworking), late delivery of products, failure to provide level of support and service to meet milestones is justification for removing the vendor from the QVL.   Information that will be Reviewed Please provide information and documentation for review by the FAA that demonstrates that your firm has accomplished any or all of the following factors and sub-factors, and provide the plans, resumes, or other information requested.  The information will be used to make a down select for the source list to be used for issuance of the formal request for proposal for the Qualified Vendors List (QVL) that will be established for this requirement.  Please note that the final make-up of the QVL will be approximately 25 percent Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) only if two or more SEDB firms are found to be technically acceptable.  If only one SEDB is found acceptable, the QVL will be limited to only the top rated firms no matter what their size.  Large businesses will be required to have and submit with their proposal a subcontracting plan that has a goal of at least 25 percent usage of small, woman owned, SEDBs.  The FAA will be looking at all of the factors below in determining the down select to a reasonable number of potential sources.  Offerors that do not address, or just request copies of the solicitation will be determined unacceptable and will not be considered as a possible source.  Down select for the QVL will be to the top 3 technically acceptable evaluated proposals.  Offerors must provide proof of SEDB status or small business status. General Information: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for developing and revising the airmanâ€™s aeronautical handbooks.  These aeronautical handbooks are to provide the necessary information for an applicant to successfully pass the appropriate knowledge and practical tests.  These tests are required for an applicant to obtain an airman certificate.  Several of these publications require updating and revision.  The average number of pages per handbook will generally increase by approximately 25 percent due to new subject matter material and enhanced graphics.  The aeronautical handbooks will be developed or revised in accordance with the current FAA technical requirements, with publishing to be accomplished by the Government Printing Office (GPO).  The services required under this market survey are sources that not only can provide the update, revision, and formatting developed in an approved format (CD-ROM) and files (software program) acceptable to the FAA and the GPO standards for printing but also have the aviation/flying background and experience to understand what it is that the text is describing, and the skills and ability to proof read the revised documents for both context and content.  In this requirement, it is these vendors with aviation background that the FAA is looking for along with the technical skills necessary to develop and produce these aeronautical handbooks.  All items developed for the FAA under this requirement shall not be copyrighted.  The contractor shall obtain releases from the copyright owner for unrestricted use and modification by the FAA, all photos, original works, and artwork incorporated into the handbooks.  Items developed for the FAA under this task cannot be used without expressed written consent from the FAA, AFS-630. These aeronautical handbooks are for both entry and advanced level airmen.  The handbooks are to be developed to provide the specific subject areas needed to support the required training and testing for airman certification.  The contents of the handbook will be written to the ninth grade education level except for required technical terms.  The graphics will be not less than four-color high resolution.  The handbooks will be developed in increments (stages) with the FAA representative reviewing and editing each increment.  The contractor shall be responsible for quality control of the documents being produced and shall be responsible for the proofing of the written text prior to submission to the FAA for review.  Any contract issued in response to this requirement will contain quality incentives based on the contractorâ€™s ability to produce documents for review that contain no grammatical errors or misspelled words, incorrect labeling or errors, or formatting errors of charts, photos, and illustrations.  The time for completing a handbook is anticipated not to exceed 12 months from start to completion for a contractor, or 24 months for a larger handbook (e.g. 500 or more pages).  Handbooks developed and revised may be published in both hard copy print and web-based formats and platforms. Technical Requirements. The Government shall furnish specifications for the publication to include style, reading level, specific emphasis topics, and other requirements for the finished product.

This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The contract will be for services primarily in the State of Texas, Zone III,  which is in the Houston and Southeast Texas area. This area includes, but is not limited to the counties of Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Colorado, Fort Bend, Galveston, Hardin, Harris, Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Matagorda, Montgomery, Newton, Orange, Polk, San Jacinto, Tyler, Waller, and Wharton. The contiguous United States is the Secondary Area. Services shall be provided under this contract within the Secondary Area if ordered by the government. However, the government shall have no obligations to order services to be performed under this contract within the Secondary Area, and its failure to order any such services shall not breach or otherwise violate the contract. In addition, the Secondary Area of this contract may also be Secondary Areas under other contracts. The  A/E firm selected shall primarily provide: design, construction management and inspection, and estimating services for repair and alteration projects, but may be required to provide development, planning, interior design, environmental studies, feasibility studies, problem analysis, design review, consulting/design/construction management for elevator work, geotechnical testing, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/abatement design/air quality monitoring, boundary and topographical surveying, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports and other architectural, engineering and technical services. The work will require primarily architectural, mechanical, electrical, and estimator disciplines, but may also require civil, structural, geotechnical, environmental, certified industrial hygienist, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, historic preservationist, construction manager/inspector, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience.  There will be no limit to the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however, the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $3 million in any one-year contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1,000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised.  Projects, while there will be no limit on size, will generally involve repairs, alterations, and improvements in connection with existing buildings or properties, and may range in size from $25,000 to $20 million in estimated construction cost; however, the typical project range is $2 million. A/E firms will be evaluated in terms of their professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, specialized experience and technical competence in the fields of energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, the use of recovered materials and services regarding asbestos related work.. Evaluation factors for the selection of the firm are as follows: (1) Experience (25%): Experience of the firm and consultants with regard to providing the types of services described above, and with regard to accomplishments of past projects including repair and alteration work. (2) Management and Inspection Capability (25%): Experience and capability of the firm and consultants with respect to complete management and inspection of services and projects of the typed described above during the construction phase. (3)Technical Ability(25%): Professional qualifications, expertise and education level of individuals employed by the firm and consultants who will be directly involved in providing the above described services and their philosophy concerning the design of repair and alteration work. .(4) Management/Organization/Production/Quality Contract (20%): Capability and past performance of the firm and consultants with respect to mobilizing, producing a high quality design, maintaining good working relationships; working with small repair and alteration projects, meeting schedules, providing accurate cost estimates, and tracking and controlling costs. (5)Performance location (5%): FAR 35.602-1 requires that GSA include location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of locality of the project be used as one of the selection criteria. In order to receive the maximum score for this factor, the A/E firm must demonstrate that at least 35 percent of the architect-engineer services (based on total annual contract price) will be accomplished within the primary geographical boundaries of the project (which is Houston and the Southeast Texas area). The A/E firm may have up to 45 calendar days after contract award to establish this production capability within the general geographical area. The Government will not indemnify the firm against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials, that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the contract. A firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead, and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract. The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table which will be a function of project size, type, and complexity. The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations and shall be a mandatory payment provision. Firms, when responding to this announcement, should address their capability with regard to each of the evaluation factors listed above, as the top rated firms recommended for interview will be recommended solely on their written response to this announcement. Architectural or engineering firms wishing to be considered must submit three (3) copies or sets of completed Standard Forms 254 and 255 and other pertinent information.

<DESC>The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract with a base period of two years, an option period of three years, and a maximum contract value of $20 million. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the requirement is 541720. The anticipated release date of the RFP is 01/05/2004 with a 30 day response time, and an award date on or before 04/01/2004. The requirement is unrestricted; all responsible sources that request the CD-ROM of Materials may submit a proposal, which will be considered. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) administers the Human Resources Strategic Assessment Program (HRSAP) to support the manpower and personnel information and analysis needs of the Department of Defense (DoD).  The HRSAP includes Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel an d Readiness (OUSD[P&R]).  These surveys assess attitudes and opinions on a wide range of personnel issues across the entire Department of Defense (DoD) community:  active-duty members, Reserve component members, civilian employees, veterans, and family members.  The Web-based survey program is known as the Status of Forces Surveys (SOFS).  There are nine SOFS a year, three of each administered to cross-sectional samples of active-duty members, Reserve component members, and DoD civilian employees.  In addition, paper-and-pencil surveys are used to obtain data on sensitive topics (e.g., sexual harassment) and from populations who have limited Internet access (e.g., spouses of active and Reserve members).  These paper surveys are typically administered with an option to complete the survey on the Web.  Persons sampled for both Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys are typically  contacted multiple times by postal and e-mail.  A small number of ad hoc surveys can also be expected with custom designed samples and methodologies.  Analyses of these survey data and other manpower and personnel data are required in support of the DoD human resources strategic plan.  Sponsoring DoD offices require personnel policy- and program-relevant information:  attitudes, opinions, behavioral intentions, and self-reported experiences and outcomes.  This information is used to formulate, monitor, and refine policies and programs affecting the morale, health, compensation, benefits, training, selection, assignments, and readiness of DoD personnel and their families.  As new policies and programs are developed, DoD requires research and studies that quickly analyze survey data to assess the expected or actual short-term effectiveness of those policies and programs.  DMDC re quires evaluations, research, and studies related to DoD personnel policies and programs.  Anticipated task deliverables could include any or all of the following types of evaluation, research, or studies and analytic products:  (1) survey research (primarily reporting and analysis but also to include some survey planning and execution) using primarily self-administered questionnaire, representative sample survey methodology but also using data instruments or methodologies such as focus groups, interview protocols, and pretesting protocols;  (2) program evaluation planning and execution using representative sample surveys and/or other social science methodologies (e.g., demographic, econometric, and operations research) to examine manpower and personnel problems, programs, or policies ); (3) statistical consulting and analysis to include sampling and weighting, and computer pro gramming of statistical applications and analyses; (4) statistical consulting and analysis in support of the USD(P&R)’s human resources strategic plan (HRSP), the DoD President’s Management Agenda (PMA) Initiatives, and the DoD Balanced Scorecard; and (5) documenting, reporting, and distributing products in a variety of formats to include technical reports; non-technical overviews and executive summaries; technical recommendations regarding military and civilian personnel management actions, policies, or procedures; briefings in both paper and computer formats including diagrams, charts, tables, graphs; and the design and support of Web sites to present and archive survey results and data related to the HRSP, PMA Initiatives, and Balanced Scorecard. All potential offerors must be registered in the Central Contract Register (CCR) to be eligible for award. Information on CCR regi stration may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.ccr.gov. A CD-ROM of materials consisting of: exhibits for submitting cost and technical proposals, report guidelines, content plans for SOFS, questionnaires, sample work products, and background information on DMDC surveys must be requested by fax or e-mail from the contact listed below. NO PROPOSAL WILL BE CONSIDERED FROM OFFERORS THAT HAVE NOT REQUESTED THE CD-ROM OF MATERIALS. The solicitation will be posted to the NECO web site: http://www.neco.navy.mil. Contractors are responsible for downloading solicitations and monitoring the web site for amendments by selecting Business Opportunities and typing the solicitation number in Search.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure four hundred seventy (470) Transition Switch Modules (TSM) to replace its current Unit Level Circuit Switch (ULCS) equipment.  The Transition Switch Module (TSM) will provide commercially available circuit switching technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment (AN/TTC-42 and SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, data transport, and bandwidth management capabilities.  The TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, intends issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-01-01-G-0128, on a sole source basis with Pioneer UAV Inc., 9 Schilling Rd, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0738 to design a replacement Ground Control Stations (GCS) for Pioneer, integrate Pioneer control software, perform system test and provide logistics support.  The contractor will deliver two Engineering Development Units and a complete Engineering Change Proposal package (ECP) to the Government at the completion of this effort.   

Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design and operating characteristics, since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 18 months. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to Michael.Mcloughlin@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado - Boulder, Joint Institutes for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) to carry out experiments on advanced frequency metrology with infrared femtosecond lasers.  NIST has initiated a program in femtosecond laser-based optical frequency metrology.  Members of the Time and Frequency Division have used femtosecond lasers in combination with laser cooled and trapped atoms/ions to build prototypes of new optical atomic clocks.  Over the past few years, NIST has initiated a program in femtosecond laser-based optical
frequency metrology.  Members of the Time and Frequency Division have used femtosecond
lasers in combination with laser cooled and trapped atoms/ions to build prototypes of new
optical atomic clocks.  While it is generally accepted that atomic standards based on optical
frequencies will be the clocks of the future, there are still a large number of research paths that
need to be explored as NIST attempts to find the best solutions for our future technological
needs.  The Cr:forsterite femtosecond-laser-based optical frequency synthesizer that NIST has
begun to develop is one such promising avenue of research that is important to pursue.   Based
on contacts with all groups in the world that perform this type of work, the Time and Frequency
Division has determined that Dr. Judah Levine (JILA Chairman) and his JILA/University of
Colorado colleagues are uniquely positioned in this field, possessing all the required experience
and skills in femtosecond lasers and precision frequency metrology.  Furthermore, the University
of Colorado, Boulder is in close proximity to NIST, and the two institutes are linked by a high
speed optical fiber network that will be used in this work.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure on a sole source basis for human genome 3.0 oligonucleotide sets with Qiagen Technologies, Inc. 1000 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 108, Alameda, CA 94501.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  One of the ATC's missions is the manufacturing of quality micro-arrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, providing training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences.  These high density DNA micro-arrays have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, and other organisms.  Qiagen is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned oligonucleotides, that can offer large oligonucleotide sets of 70 bases (70 mers) in size that can be used for large scale expression  and complex expression studies.  Since significant work has been done using Qiagen oligonucleotides, they are believed to be the only ones which will maintain compatibility and allow comparison of experimental results without introducing new variables.  This is not a request for competitive request.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  This statement must list all oligonucleotides available and shall specify  quality, size, and encompass the genes that make up the oligo set.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington DC time) on December 29, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with Harris Corporation, Broadcast Communications Division, 3200 Wismann Lane, P.O. Box 4290, Quincy, IL 62305 for the fabrication and shipping of PAL, VHF and/or UHF, Television (TV) broadcasting systems major equipment in Iraq at frequencies and power levels to be determined by the BBG.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  In order to identify sources that are responsive to meeting the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq major equipment fabrication and shipping requirements, the BBG conducted a market survey, that was initiated via a BBG "Sources Sought" Notice published at the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) for Vendors Internet website on November 14, 2003.  This market survey FBO Notice informed interested sources of the BBG's mandatory technical capabilities and experience requirements that such sources must meet to qualify for performing the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq major equipment fabrication and shipping work, including the urgent and compelling capability of being able to fabricate and ship the major equipment for an interim BBG TV broadcasting system that can be installed in Baghdad, Iraq by February 29, 2004.  Interested sources responding to the BBG's November 14, 2003 FBO Notice submitted a written "Capabilities Statement" to the BBG to demonstrate that their technical capabilities and pertinent experience is responsive to the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq major equipment fabrication and shipping requirements, as determined by the BBG's review and validation of the information contained in the submitted Capabilities Statements and any follow-up information requested by the BBG (as also provided for in the November 14, 2003 FBO Notice).  Pursuant to the BBG's review and validation of Harris Corporation's capabilities and experience in TV broadcasting systems engineering and major equipment fabrication and shipping, as documented in Harris Corporation's Capabilities Statement that was submitted to the BBG in response to its market survey, the BBG has determined that Harris Corporation is responsive to the BBG's PAL, VHF and/or UHF, TV broadcasting systems in Iraq major equipment fabrication and shipping requirements.  Therefore, the BBG intends to contract with Harris Corporation to fabricate television transmitter(s) and  to supply other television broadcasting systems major equipment, including but not limited to television antenna(s), transmission line(s), and power regulation equipment, and to export pack and provide for the shipping of the above-stated TV broadcasting systems major equipment by NLT January 31, 2004 to BBG designated location(s) for a requirement of up to two (2)  complete BBG TV broadcasting systems that will be installed by a different contractor in Baghdad and/or Basrah, Iraq.   It is particularily noteworthy that the urgent establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq is a top U.S. Government priority that specifically includes the BBG's launch and operation of the first TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq by NLT February 29, 2004 and a ssecond TV broadcast system in Basrah, Iraq by NLT March 22, 2004.  Not achieving this Baghdad TV broadcasting system operating date would result in the BBG's not meeting the U.S. Congress' compelling mandate for the timely establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems that will provide television programming to the Iraqi people in key cities, per its authorization and appropriation of FY-2004 funding for this specific purpose.  This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively contract with Harris Corporation is not a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  Other firms that are interested in this BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq major equipment fabrication and shipping work may respond to this Public Notice by stating their interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience to meet the BBG's TV broadcasting systems requirements cited in the notice, that specifically includes the February 29, 2004 Baghdad TV broadcasting system installation deadline. The BBG must receive all such "Capabilities Statements" by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST), Wednesday, December 31, 2003.  The BBG's determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the BBG.   Any "Capabilities Statements" and/or other information received by the BBG from interested firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the BBG solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with Astro Systems, Inc., 7979 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, MD 20814 for the installation of PAL, VHF and/or UHF, Television (TV) broadcasting systems in Iraq at frequencies and power levels to be determined by the BBG.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  In order to identify sources that are responsive to meeting the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements, the BBG conducted a market survey, that was initiated via a BBG "Sources Sought" Notice published at the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Business Opportunities (FBO)
for Vendors Internet website on November 14, 2003.  This market survey FBO Notice informed interested sources of the BBG's mandatory technical capabilities and experience requirements that such sources must meet to qualify for performing the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation work, including the urgent and compelling capability of being able to install an interim BBG TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq by February 29, 2004.  Interested sources responding to the BBG's November 14, 2003 FBO Notice submitted a written "Capabilities Statement" to the BBG to demonstrate that their technical capabilities and pertinent experience may be responsive to the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements, as determined by the BBG's review and validation of the information contained in the submitted Capabilities Statements and any follow-up information requested by the BBG (as also provided for in the November 14, 2003 FBO Notice).  Pursuant to the BBG's review and validation of Astro Systems, Inc.'s capabilities and experience in overseas TV broadcasting systems engineering and installation, as documented in Astro Systems, Inc's. Capabilities Statement that was submitted to the BBG in response to its market survey, the BBG has determined that Astro Systems, Inc. is responsive to the BBG's PAL, VHF and/or UHF, TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements.  Therefore, the BBG intends to contract with Astro Systems, Inc. to install (including, but not limited to, site surveys, commissioning, testing, and training) new BBG TV broadcast systems in at least two (2) prominent Iraqi cities, Baghdad and Basrah.  It is particularily noteworthy that the urgent establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq is a top U.S. Government priority that specifically includes the BBG's launch and operation of the first TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq by NLT February 29, 2004 and a second TV broadcast system in Basrah, Iraq by NLT March 22, 2004.  Not achieving this Baghdad TV broadcasting system operating date would result in the BBG's not meeting the U.S. Congress' compelling mandate for the timely establishment of  BBG TV broadcasting systems that will provide television programming to the Iraqi people in key cities, per its authorization and appropriation of FY-2004 funding for this specific purpose.  This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively contract with Astro Systems, Inc. is not a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  Other firms that are interested in this BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation work may respond to this Public Notice by stating their interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience to meet the BBG's TV broadcasting systems requirement cited in the notice, that specifically includes the February 29, 2004 Baghdad TV broadcasting system installation deadline.  The BBG must receive all such "Capabilities Statements" by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST), Wednesday, December 31, 2003.  The BBG's determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the BBG.  Any "Capabilities Statements" and/or other information received by the BBG from interested firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the BBG solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.   Any questions regarding this Public Notice shall be submitted via facsimile to Ms. Marlene Brooks, Office of Contracts (M/CON/CR), at (202) 260-0855.  Written responses to this Public Notice shall be facsimiled to Ms. Brooks at (202) 260-0855.  Telephone responses of a firm's statements of interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience will not be accepted by the BBG.  This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a noncommercial program entitled Lightweight release units for the OH-58D helicopter.  The objective of the program is to acquire the necessary sets of the ALKAN light weight release units and associated technical data and cont ractor support to conduct qualification testing.  It is anticipated that under the resulting contract, ALKAN will deliver three sets of hardware; however, one additional set will be included as a priced option to support the qualification testing.  The Gov ernment intends to conduct the qualification testing as a piggy-back effort during the Control Display System IV (CDS4) testing on the OH-58D in June 2004.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be awarded to ALKAN, who is deemed to be the only respon sible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement. This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Alpha co ntract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to ALKAN.  The specific contract requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and ALKAN, consistent with alpha contracting procedures and applicable cost princi ples, clauses, and provisions in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  ALKAN is the original designer and manufacturer of this lightweight release unit, which provides numerous benefits, including greater safety, better performance ca pability, and reduction in maintenance effort and cost.  The lightweight release units include an electromechanical release system that eliminates the need for pyrotechnic (explosive) jettision system.  This design is favorable due to the increased cost an d safety concerns with using and storing explosive devices.  In addition, the inherent design of the ALKAN rack allows for boresight repeatability and retention, which reduces maintenance effort and cost.  The lightweight release units are a proprietary sy stem developed by ALKAN.  ALKAN is the only firm holding the design, development, and software knowledge necessary to successfully perform the technology integration and test support efforts required by the Government.  Specifications, plans or drawings re lating to this procurement are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. The period of performance for this program is twelve (12) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  The size sta ndard is 1500.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Robin Kemp-Tate), Building 401 Lee Boulevard,  Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Kemp-Tates phone number is 757-878-3874.

Aerovironment is determined  to be the only source for this as they were the manufacturers of the original prototypes, and they are now producing the upgraded prototypes.  The cost of this upgrade will be at or below the simplified acquisition threshold of $100K.  There is no solicit ation document available for this acquisition.  Interested sources shall make any inquiries about this work no later than 24 December 2003.

<DESC>Please note the date change in paragraph 3. The U.S. Air Force Material Command, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Air-To-Surface Munitions Directorate, Hill AFB UT, is seeking potential sources that are currently remanufacturing or have similar experiences in manufacturing or remanufacturing Medium Caliber Ammunition.  Potential sources shall have Radioactive Material License or similar permit to allow for receipt and handling of the Depleted Uranium projectiles.  This project will assess the feasibility of remanufacturing 30MM Combat Mix Ammunition and consist of eight lots (2300 rounds/lot) of suspended or overage ammunition.  The API & HEI projectiles will be removed from the cartridge case, cleaned of sealants, screened for defects, and the serviceable projectiles assembled on new cartridge cases with new propellants.  The remanufactured rounds will be sent to Eglin AFB, FL for testing.  Some of the selected eight lots will have suspected projectile defects, therefore screening must be accomplished and defective projectiles removed before remanufacture. At a minimum, 1150 rounds from each of the eight lots shall be remanufactured and submitted for testing.  The project includes validating manufacturing capacity, cost analysis per round of remanufacture, percentage of each test lot that could be remanufactured and reliability and performance of remanufactured product.  Rebuilt rounds will comply with appropriate Technical Manuals and pass Lot Acceptance Testing before acceptance by the government.

This Sources Sought notice is not a request for proposal and is not considered a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to make any awards on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for any information submitted.  It is the intent of this notice to find sources that have or can remanufacture 30MM Combat Mix (API & HEI) Ammunition.

Interested/capable sources are requested to submit electronic technical capability statements and relevant information by 5 January 2004 to:  Department of the Air Force, Directorate of Contracting, OO-ALC/WMK Bldg 1215, 6050 Gum Lane, Hill AFB UT 84041, Attn:  Olalani Kamakau or email to Olalani.kamakau@hill.af.mil.     

Submittals shall address and consist of:  1) Evidence of Radioactive Material license or similar permit allowing for the receipt and handling of Depleted Uranium projectiles; 2) Current or previous contracts on, manufacture, remanufacture, or demilitarization  of 30MM Combat Mix Ammunition or similar; 3) Product brochures and/or technical data describing existing  ammunition manufacturing/remanufacturing capability  that meets or exceeds the listed project requirements; and 4) Business size and percentage goals for small businesses.

<DESC>The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) has a need to dry lease up to 20 airplanes for ten (10) years, to be used on wildland fire missions for lead plane and other administrative activities.  The aircraft will be flown in mountainous terrain below 500 feet in turbulent conditions.  The aircraft shall be made available for the year-around exclusive use by the Government and flown by U.S Forest Service Pilots.  The Government shall provide fuel and pilots, and the contractor(s) shall provide all maintenance to the aircraft throughout the life of the contracts.  Government-owned facilities are not available for contractors use.  The Government anticipates awarding two contracts for ten (10) aircraft each, which may be of different types and models, on a fixed-price monthly lease and flight hour basis.  Delivery of the aircraft is anticipated to be over a two-year period (2004 through 2005).  The Government intends to use Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 procedures, with full and open competition, and award performance-based contracts on a best-value basis.  The aircraft will be evaluated on its ability to perform low level leadplane and air attack missions, and its ability to perform administrative activities.  This will be accomplished by offerors making available fully equipped aircraft (one of each type/model offered) for test flights to be scheduled during the evaluation process prior to contract awards.  We anticipate posting the solicitation on this website within 30-60 days from the posting of this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMMENDMENT IS TO POST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION AS ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 12/9/03.  Questions and Answers: 1.Is there an incumbent for this requirement? 1. No. 2. Is this a small business set-aside? 2. No. 3. Is there  a dollar ceiling associated with the Base Period and/or the two (2) additional options? 3. See question 9. This requirement will be for a base period of 24 months.   4. It is not clear if Option A is an option within Task 2 (words "Option A" follow a sub-heading of "Step 2", within the text  discussion of Task 2).  Please clarify the relationship of Step 2 and Option A, to Task 2.  Similarly, it is not clear if Option B is an option within Task 2 also. Please clarify. 4.For Task 2 there are two approaches (A and B)described for estimating soil carbon flux that may be implemented based  on the outcome of the February Workshop.  Step 1 is a step that is common to both Options A and B so it is described at the front.  Option A is use of the IPCC methodology and Option B is use of a soil process model.  Following the discussion at the workshop, it may determined that a the countries  want a combination of options A and B, and the contractor needs to be prepared to fulfill this need. 6. Are you looking for separate budgets for the base and each option? May offerors submit quotes based on GSA Schedules? 6. Offerors should submit a budget for the base year. This requirement will  be for a 24 month base year without options.  Offerors may submit price quotes based on GSA Schedules, but are not required to submit a quote in this manner and are not required to be a GSA Schedule contractor.  7. Is it permissible to team with another firm? In this case, do both firms need to  have a federal price schedule in place (e.g., GSA)? 7. Teaming arrangements are acceptable. Since this is not a federal price schedule requirement, neither firm is required to be on schedule.  8. Is the final proposal due December 19th? Ten days does seem to be a short turnaround time to prepare a  quality proposal that addresses all the elements requested. 8. Due to stringent time constraints, the deadline of December 19 WLL NOT be extended.  9.  With regards to the cost proposal/budget, is there a separate budget for travel? 9.  The overall Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for  this requirement is $170,000.00 to include all travel and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) as described in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 45 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, National Ice Core Laboratory, Denver, Colorado, has an ongoing requirement for maintenance of its complex refrigeration system.  It is critical to have immediate response to any problems which may arise with the equipment by technicians who are familiar with every aspect of this complex system, which includes compressors and fluid refrigeration circuits.  Technicians must also have extensive experience with Teletrol systems integration, design, maintenance, and repair, the computer controls which run the entire refrigeration system.  The period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months, with options for two (2) additional years.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Tolin Mechanical Systems,12005 East 46th Avenue, Denver, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See Note 22.

<DESC>2	INTRODUCTION, OVERVIEW, OR BACKGROUND

The U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) is part of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and is collocated with and under operational control of Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC).  The USAISR is dedicated to both laboratory and clinical trauma research.  Its mission is to provide requirements-driven combat casualty care medical solutions and products for injured soldiers from self-aid through definitive care across the full spectrum of military operations; provide state-of-the-art trauma, burn, and critical care to Department of Defense beneficiaries around the world; and provide Burn Special Medical Augmentation Response Teams. 

The Institute’s Burn Center admits approximately 300 patients annually, and provides burn flight teams to ensure safe military aero medical transfer from the initial hospitalization site to Fort Sam Houston.  The staff also conducts clinical burn training programs for physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals and supports clinical trauma research programs.  Recently, the Institute’s Burn Center and BAMC’s Trauma and Critical Care Services were combined to form the Department of Defense’s only Trauma Division.  This service admits over 1,300 trauma patients yearly, and with this combined effort, a unified approach to trauma and trauma research can now be accomplished.

The Institute’s Combat Casualty Care research mission encompasses six basic research areas: Hemostasis, Resuscitation, Bone Tissue Injury, Soft Tissue Injury, Trauma Informatics, and Clinical Trauma.  These six areas focus on saving the soldiers’ lives, preventing viable tissue loss, and returning the soldiers back to duty as soon as medically possible. 
In hemostasis research, the Institute is developing new hemostatic field dressings and tourniquet use for compressible bleeding, intra-cavitary agents to stop non-compressible bleeding, injectable drugs to enhance or restore hemostatic function, and new devices to stop severe internal bleeding. 
In resuscitation research, the Institute is evaluating when, how, and what kind of resuscitation fluids to use on the battlefield, attempting to standardize treatment by the medic and reduce the amount of fluid the medic has to carry without increasing morbidity or mortality. 
In bone tissue injury research, the Institute is studying antimicrobial external fixator pins, antimicrobial bone replacement material, and wound irrigation techniques and devices to reduce morbidity on the battlefield. 
In soft tissue injury research, the Institute is investigating antimicrobial polymer bandages, improved field tourniquet, and antibiotics for far-forward use to reduce the impact of tissue injuries and enable soldiers to continue on with their mission. 
In trauma informatics research, the Institute is evaluating what to measure and how to develop the medical monitoring devices capable of providing critical real-time information about the severity of wounds and risks of mortality in order to assist the medic in determining the best strategies and priorities for remote trauma triage of injured soldiers on the battlefield. 
In clinical trauma research, the Institute is examining a variety of combat casualty care problems in trauma/burn patients including those described in the other five research areas to improve treatment and reduce morbidity and mortality. 
The guiding strategy for the Institute’s research program is to take the clinical problems identified on the battlefield into our research laboratory for further investigations and solutions, and then validate those solutions in the clinical setting before they are returned to the battlefield as medical doctrine. 
With a state-of-the-art facility of over 140,000 square feet and a multidisciplinary staff of over 250 personnel, both military and civilian, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, pathologists, nurses, microbiologists, physiologists, biochemists, veterinarians, and technical and administrative support personnel, the USAISR is a world-class organization, well suited to provide combat casualty care solutions for the Department of Defense and the civilians of South Central Texas.

The support mission of the Information Management Office (IMO) for USAISR is to provide or coordinate computer hardware, software, programming and data network support; systems analysis, data integration; and database support; and technical research support for clinical/research instrumentation and data acquisition processes and for the Clinical Division (Burn Center and Trauma Service), Laboratory Division and Support Division of the USAISR.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate and award modifications under its existing indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts with Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, OH; the Centre for Applied Microbiology Research, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK; Southern Research Institute, Frederick MD; the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX; Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; and SRI International, Menlo Park, CA. The contracts’ current period of performance will not be affected by these changes.  These contracts were a part of a multiple award made under RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-39 for the project titled “In Vitro and Animal Models for Emerging Diseases and Biodefense.”  The contract numbers are N01-AI-30061, N01-AI-30062, N01-AI-30063, N01-AI-30065, N01-AI-40004, and N01-AI-40005, respectively. The award of these modifications and resulting increase in the contract ceilings will allow the NIAID to utilize more fully the capabilities of these Contractors to meet our needs as outlined in our Biodefense Research Agenda.  These contracts were initiated to bridge the gap between basic research or early target/lead identification and preclinical/advanced product development.  They have become a valuable means of supporting advanced product development and with the creation of Project BioShield, it is likely that NIAID will need more early and advanced product development than originally anticipated.  Therefore, these contracts will be modified to increase the current contract ceilings from $40,000,000 to $80,000,000 so that additional task orders can be competed and awarded in accordance with FAR Part 16.505 to support this increased demand and allow NIAID to maintain ready and available resources in this area.  The original contracts were awarded using full and open competition procedures. NIAID intends to negotiate and award these modifications under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  NIAID wishes to capitalize on the current testing capabilities of these Contractors to accomplish the additional effort anticipated.  This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties who believe that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim. Please include contact person(s) and phone number(s), and identify the type of business, e.g. educational institution, small business, large for profit, research non-profit, etc. The Government will consider any such information received within 45 days of the publication date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and award these modifications to the Contractors listed above. See Government-wide Numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SOLNBR>SSC-San_Diego_MKTSVY_21EAE
<RESPDATE>011604
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Linda Mulligan, Contract Specialist, 619-553-4538
<DESC>An HF EXCOMM antenna specification for the DD(X) is currently being developed.  In the initial stages of development, it is essential that viable candidate antenna designs for the evolving HF system be identified, delineated, and evaluated.  This would allow the desired specification to be developed around the most useful candidate design.  A system supporting up to eight simultaneous, separate, full-duplex, transmit and receive users is needed.  There is no requirement that the antennas be full-duplex; full-duplex applies only to the radios.  Separate transmit and receive antennas are acceptable.  The proposed topside ship architecture precludes the use of antennas with radiating components above the ships outer surface.  Thus, low profile antennas are required.  The specification to be developed includes the HF EXCOMM system and related equipment.  This equipment includes transmit and receive antennas and their associated ship interface components, multiï·“couplers or their equivalent, and any equipment used to provide transmit-to-receive isolation.  In short, the HF EXCOMM system includes all RF equipment that lies between the radio interfaces and free-space.  Detailed HF system requirements are given in MILï·“STD-188-203-1A [1] which states, for example, that at HF, the radio equipment should be capable of providing omni-directional gapless coverage of up to 300 nautical miles from the transmitter (paragraph 5.1.2).  The accuracy and stability of the HF emission, as well as other performance characteristics, are also given in the same reference (paragraph 5.3.2). The respondent shall provide as a minimum:  (1) system block diagram detailing all of the system hardware and interfaces; (2) system performance data (measured or predicted) including loss, filter characteristics, size, weight, power, and other relevant performance data; (3) antenna design concept and performance (measured or predicted) including loss, efficiency, materials, gain, size, weight, power and other relevant performance data; (4) transmit-to-receive isolation concept and performance (measured or predicted); (5) transmit-to-receive link analysis for a 300 nautical mile path (ground wave) with a 10dB receive S/N ratio and a frequency range of 2-9 MHz; (6) a description of the system maturity level, and (7) ROM development cost estimate.  Teaming is encouraged if necessary to provide a complete system approach.  However, responses which do not include a complete system solution will also be considered.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued.  However, SPAWAR and the Navy will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning.  It is recognized that cost information which is provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates.  Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways which best meet Navy needs.  The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies.

An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Focused Quantum Systems (FoQuS) Workshop
<DESC>Focused Quantum Systems (FoQuS) Workshop, SN04-08.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO), Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO), and Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are organizing a team-forming workshop for a possible new DARPA FoQuS program.  This program would undertake development of a functional Quantum Information Processor (QuIP) that is ultimately scalable to a “useful and practical” QuIP; i.e., a practical processor capable of solving problems that cannot be solved by classical computers within reasonable time.  Specific program objectives are: (1) Demonstrate a fully integrated QuIP consisting of two or more logical qubits and capable of performing fault-tolerant execution of simple quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa, with high fidelity;  (2) Develop systems concepts and hardware for a QuIP or Quantum Computer (QC), including elements of control, I/O, programmability, internal communications between non-adjacent qubits, memory, architecture, and integration of components into a seamless system containing all the elements needed for a useful and practical QuIP or QC and whose internal component structure is transparent to the user, and; (3) Perform quantitative physical and systems analysis of the QuIP to define specific avenues for scaling the system developed in the FoQuS program to a useful and practical processor in the future.  This includes, but is not limited to, simulation and modeling of the quantum processor, architecture-dependent propagation of error and fidelity, and, most importantly, a demonstration of scalability, including the development of the scalability criteria themselves.  The workshop will be held January 28-29, 2004, at the Marriott Fairview Park in Falls Church, VA.  The workshop goals are: (a) formulate a strategy for capitalizing on advances in quantum information hardware and the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computing to create a functional and scalable first-generation quantum information processor and (b) promote formation of interdisciplinary teams to invent technical and engineering solutions that are scalable to a useful and practical quantum information processor. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel, invited speakers and poster session forums including summary overviews to facilitate interaction and team forming amongst the participants to assist in responding to an expected DARPA solicitation early in 2004.  Participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters and three-minute summary overview presentations describing areas of capabilities and interest to facilitate communications, interactions and team prospecting.  A short abstract of each poster presentation is required.  Explicit instructions for preparation and submission of these materials, as well as workshop details including registration information, are given on the FoQuS workshop website: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/Index.asp?meetingid=228.  The workshop registration fee is $200 and includes all workshop activities.  Registration is limited by the venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended.  The registration deadline is Tuesday, January 13, 2004.  Further administrative information is available from Mara Scheele (mscheele@snap.org). Additional technical and agenda information can be obtained from Mark Filipkowski (filipkowski_mark@bah.com).  Please refer to the FoQuS Workshop in correspondence.

<CONTACT>Jim Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 571.227.1600, Fax 571.227.1948, Email j.thompson@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks support from a contractor (or contractor team) to perform advanced terrorist threat analysis (TTA) of TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary.  The analysis should be able to confirm an individual’s identity using public records data, and use that confirmed identity to provide insight and information as to whether the individual presents a potential terrorist threat or has possible connections to potential terrorists.

This analysis will require little subjectivity: if there is a “hit,” e.g., someone is found to be on a list or other data source, or a connection is shown between a subject and someone on a list or other data sources, that finding is flagged and analyzed immediately.  This analysis will be enhanced by the ability to confirm an individual’s identity through the use of extensive public records data.  This data will also be used as the input for the analysis; such extensive data can be utilized because of the relatively small size of the population to be checked (when compared to the traveling public, for example).

Dangerous terrorists may be known to Law Enforcement and Intelligence Community (LE/IC) agencies, and be included on various watch lists and other data sources available to TSA.

These terrorists, and others not known to LE/IC agencies and therefore not on watch lists or other data sources, are also likely to try to achieve relative obscurity by constructing typical lifestyles on U.S. soil.  In so doing, they will develop an “electronic footprint” of publicly available information that can be acquired and used as a key input for TTA.

Other terrorists who have not been able to establish a significant or useful electronic footprint may still be identified by TTA because of the lack of a footprint, and/or by other information provided to Federal agencies including, but not limited to, their planned U.S. destination upon entry into the country.

TSA seeks a contractor with TTA capability that will enable comparisons of biographic and other extensive publicly available information on TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary, to similar information sets on potential terrorist threats who are included on LE/IC and open source terrorist and classified watch lists, as well as those identified by the analysis itself.

TSA will provide the contractor with the information needed (e.g., name, Social Security Number, and birth date) to conduct the TTA.  If necessary, TSA will provide the contractor with copies of databases or access to databases when those databases are to be used and/or updated during the course of this contract.    

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, equipment, facilities, and perform everything necessary for and incident to the performance of the TTA.

Capabilities Statement

Prior to issuing a request for proposal, TSA is soliciting information from interested contractors on their capability to perform advanced TTA.  

Interested parties should submit a capabilities statement, not exceeding ten (10) pages that addresses the following:

A)  Identify two (2) contracts of similar scope and magnitude that your company performed as prime contractor.  Similar scope and magnitude is defined as nationwide implementation of a system covering at least 30,000 employees requiring specialized background investigation analysis.  Provide the name of the customer(s), names(s) of the point of contact, with telephone number.  Identify whether it was a Government of commercial entity.

B)  General corporate capabilities, to include, but not limited to: length of time in business; number of employees; locations nationwide;  and IT capability.  


In addition to the above, contractor must submit documentation that verifies the following requirements.  This required information is excluded from the ten (10)-page limitation for the capabilities statement above.

(1)	The contractor’s facility must be authorized for the storage and retention of TOP SECRET information.  The contractor must submit certification to demonstrate that the facility where the TTAs will be performed has met all standards for safeguarding TOP SECRET information.
(2)	The contractor must have high-speed computers that are capable of encrypting information prior to transmission and decoding encrypted information.    
(3)	Personnel at the facility who will have access to the TOP SECRET data must have a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation or have received a Government TOP SECRET Security clearance within the last five years.  The contractor is to identify the number of these individuals and, for each, identify the extent to which the individual has the computer skills necessary to electronically conduct TTA analyses.
(4)	The contractor must provide documentation that the company is domestically owned, domestically controlled, and domestically located.
(5)	The contractor must provide TSA with information to document that the contractor has a history of successfully implementing highly similar projects in terms of scope, complexity, and sensitivity.  TSA is particularly interested in having the contractor demonstrate the capability to conduct at least 30,000 TTAs in 120 days.  In addition, contractor should demonstrate the capability to complete each TTA in less than twelve (12) hours. 
(6)	The contractor is to provide TSA with a list of the public records the contractor plans to use to verify an individual’s identity and to obtain additional biographic information about the individual for use in the TTA analysis (e.g., former addresses, places of employment, etc.).

A Government Team will evaluate the capabilities statements and supporting documents received and will determine which submissions meet the Government’s need/requirement, as stated above.  Contractors who meet the TSA’s minimum need/requirement will receive the full solicitation package.  Any contractor who fails to demonstrate that they meet the TSA’s minimum need/requirement will be excluded from any further consideration.  Responses must be submitted via email to j.thompson@dhs.gov and holly.bolger@dhs.gov or facsimile to 571-227-1948.  

Responses are due by 4:00 pm Eastern time on Tuesday, December 23, 2003.
