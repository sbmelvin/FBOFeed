The information attained from this sources sought will be reviewed by the Government and used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.

Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.

<p>Basis for Award: An Award will be made to the contractor who is determined to offer the Best Value based on price, past performance, and technical aspects.

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.    Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139 million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (OEG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of designing the 2007-2011 Strategy.  Under the 2000-2006 Strategy, the Office of Economic Growth (OEG) is responsible for the management of a large portfolio which comprises of two Strategic Objectives, SO1.3 – An Improved Environment for the Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises with three intermediate results (IRs)

The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued. Viewing/downloading documents from FedBizOpps will require prior registration in Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov). If you are a first-time FedBizOpps user, you will also be required to register in FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) before accessing the RFP documents. To register, click on the Register Now button in the Vendors Block and follow the instructions. The following information will be required: Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN); DUNS Number or Cage Code; Telephone Number; and E-mail Address. Once registered with FedBizOpps, interested parties will then be able to log in and access the RFP documents.<br /><br />Important Note: Solicitation documents can be accessed ONLY through FedBizOpps. Please note that ALL contractors who want to register with FedBizOpps must be CCR registered, and have a MPIN, DUNS number or Cage code. For further information, please click on the FedBizOpps homepage link and the Vendor User Guide. The only plan-holders/bidders list now available is via FedBizOpps. When viewing the synopsis/pre-solicitation notice, you will click on the ADD ME TO INTERESTED VENDORS to enter your information. This function does not, however, allow you to identify yourself as a prime contractor or subcontractor. It is recommended that you identify your category in parentheses at either the beginning or end of your company name. For example: (Prime/Sub) XYZ Construction, or XYZ Construction (Prime/Sub). IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO CHECK FEDBIZOPPS FREQUENTLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THE SOLICITATION.<br /></p>
