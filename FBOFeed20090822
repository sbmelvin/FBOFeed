<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Wilmot and Sanz Inc.,  18310 Montgomery Village Ste 300, Gaithersburg, MD 20879-3552 for the services as outlined below: 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-243-DDC. 

Background Information
The NHLBI has plans to acquire a new cardiac catheterization angiography system.  This will entail a large scale planning project and relocation of two existing Siemens X-Ray systems.  The new cardiac catheterization angiography system will also have implications on research collaborations at NIH and with new programs that are developing with Childrens Hospital in Washington, DC.

Wilmot Sanz, Inc. was the original designer of record when the two existing Siemens systems were installed in Building 10 on the Bethesda Campus.  These two systems will be removed, stored, reconfigured and then reinstalled over the course of this project. Wilmot Sanz, Inc. will provide the most efficient management and planning services based on their familiarity with the subject space and equipment.

Purpose and Objectives
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) need a contractor to provide planning, program management, operational and logistical support services.  

The program management, planning and implementation services requested from the Contractor directly assist the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) to successfully implement the new cardiac catheterization angiography system.  The Contractor must demonstrate the ability to effectively interact with NHLBI facilities team and researchers to achieve a successful project. 
  
The Contractor will be involved with the project from start to finish.  From the time a purchase order is in place, NHLBI expects the project duration to last approximately 12 months.  There consultation services will occur over the course of project planning, design, construction and post construction.

Contract Requirement

1.	The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive planning documentation and course of action to remove, store, and reinstall the existing Siemens X-Ray equipment.  This task will require the application of prior knowledge, as-built documents, and data in regards to the current space.  
2.	Development of program of requirements documents, technical studies, analytical investigations, and floor plan test to fit options to address the selection and placement of cardiac catheterization angiography system.
3.	Comprehensive management skills to oversee the execution of this project.  A high level of responsiveness is required for the entire life cycle of the contract.   Tracking tools and responsive follow up is essential within the managerial approach.
4.	Technical architectural and engineering consultation in regards to the placement and installation of the new cardiac catheterization angiography system.  This effort includes technical evaluation of documents provided by others.
5.	Demonstrate a high level of quality control over work output recognizing that the prime audience involved with this project is senior level scientists and administrators.
6.	Comprehensively track schedule and implementation timelines to ensure the project is delivered according to plan.

Government Requirements
The government will supply current space plans of existing space/equipment layouts.  The pre-design and planning process will go through an NIH review to make sure that the contractor is abiding by the NIH Design Requirements Manual.
Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
The Contractor will provide progress reports of the overall project at 35%, 65%, 95%, and 100% completion.  These reports will be reviewed by the Government for approval.
Inspection and acceptance
The NIH Design Review Manual will be the primary source criteria for review.  This review will take place at each submission of a progress report.  Both NHLBI and the Office of Research Facilities will be involved in the review of each report.  NHLBI and the ORF project officer must accept each report prior to moving forward with the next.

Period of performance:  The proposed period of performance for this service is approximately 12 months.  

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Clinical Center Building 10 Room 6C103A, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) requires the services of a contractor to provide planning, program management, operational and logistical support services. This will entail a large scale planning project and relocation of two existing Siemens X-Ray systems. The new cardiac catheterization angiography system will also have implications on research collaborations at NIH and with new programs that are developing with Childrens Hospital in Washington, DC.  Wilmot Sanz, Inc. was the original designer for the two existing Siemens system installed in building 10 at NIH. The systems need to be removed, stored, reconfigured and then reinstalled over the course of the project.  The program management, planning and implementation services requested from Wilmot Sanz, Inc., directly assist the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) to successfully implement the new cardiac catheterization angiography system.  Based on the knowledge and experience by Wilmot Sanz, Inc., it is to the Governments best interest not to compete this requirement.

Approximately 1000-1200 outpatients are seen per day.

Additionally, there is a need for the contractor to maintain an inventory of wheelchairs that are used by patients attending appointments.  The contractor will deliver these wheelchairs, upon patients or caretakers request, to the patient to facilitate patients travel from the car in the valet greeting area to the appointment and back to the car in the valet greeting area.  The wheelchairs may be inside the facility front door, in the valet greeting area, outside the facility front door, or in the parking lot designated for valet-parked cars.  The contractor will be completely liable and responsible for ticketing, securing keys, parking, delivering, and directing certain valet vehicles to and from the valet greeting area, for the period specified in accordance with all terms, conditions, schedules, provisions, and requirements of any solicitation and/or resultant contract.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking 100% total small business set-aside vendors that can provide quotes/proposals.  NAICS  Code 334516

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant of firm fixed price purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular  05-32.  This award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  NAICS CODE  334516

Equipment: Miniature, Battery operated, Portable, Heated, Nine-Reflections Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Instrument 

Background:

The Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry Branch of the Office of Regulatory Science (CFSAN/ORS/DAC/SMSB) requires the purchase of a miniature, battery-operated, portable, temperature controlled, nine-reflection Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer based on interferometry and equipped with an ATR crystal that is under 5-mm in diameter. This research grade instrument shall have the sensitivity, accuracy and stability to enable quantitative determinations of microliter-size test samples with a signal to noise ratio greater than 10:1 for a 0.5% analyte level.  In addition, spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 and sensitivity are required. The instrument that has been identified to meet these needs is the A2 Technologies ML portable, battery operated, PDA controlled, nine-reflection, temperature controlled ATR-FTIR ML Spectrometer. This state-of-the-art instrumentation shall be used in several important center programs. Most importantly, ATR-FTIR instrumentation provides the ability to evaluate many sample platforms including solids and liquids. Specifically, CFSAN has efforts focused on the identification of pathogens in foods (via immunoassays, DNA hybridization using nanoparticles and magnetic bead technology), detection of toxins, characterization of dietary supplements (conjugated linoleic acid geometric isomers), analysis of multi-layer food packaging materials, characterization of cosmetics (TiO2 nanoparticles, lead), detection of allergens (casein, honey), determination of food constituents (rapid determination of total trans fats, infant formula components), and discovery of food contaminants/adulterants (food security).


Technical Requirements:    QTY  1

	General: SMSB has a need for a portable analyzer that can be used in the laboratory and in the field, does not require a laptop, PDA controlled, and give qualitative answers and quantitative determinations at room temperature and at elevated temperatures (using a temperature controller) that are as good as results that can be achieved in the laboratory using laboratory-grade equipment. As a portable system, it must weigh less than 15 lbs and include an on-board computer to compute and display the results of the analysis as well as an internal battery for 4 hours of continuous operation.  The system shall have a nine- reflection heated diamond ATR sample interface to allow for the various analyses listed above.  To be comparable with laboratory grade spectrometers, the system shall be an FT-IR with a spectral range of 4000  650 cm-1 and a resolution of 4 cm-1 or better. For field use, a ZnSe beamsplitter is required, making a purge or dessicant pack unnecessary.  A KBr beamsplitter is unacceptable due to its hygroscopic nature. To ensure the best performance, an internal calibration source and automated laser and FTIR alignment shall be used.

The model's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">primary function</span> is to provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation's GAAP liability that withstands audit scrutiny (e.g. liability is fairly stated in all material respects). In addition to the GAAP liability estimate, the model also provides an estimate of budgetary needs, given a proposed number of enrollments in AmeriCorps. The current Trust Service Award liability (TSAL) model was developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2001 and re-assessed by Econometrical in 2005. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The model uses data captured via eSPAN to determine the most up-to-date experience within the Trust and project the needs on a prospective basis.

Where possible, these points will be photo identifiable (i.e. corner of concrete, corner of pavement, end of paint line, etc.).  This makes it possible to use this control in future projects.  The coordinate system will be WGS 1984 UTM Zone 16N Horizontal and NAVD 88 vertical.  Units will be metric. A detailed report with descriptions and coordinates of the points will be included in the final deliverables.<BR><BR>4.   Orthophotography:<BR>Updated orthophotography using the new aerial photography will be produced covering the sites and extending 200 feet (~60 meters) outside the boundaries.  The Nashville Armory imagery will be produced using the new control and USGS DEM surface model data with a 0.075 meter (0.25 foot) pixel resolution.  The four VTS site orthophotos will be produced using the DTM data collected and supplemented with USGS DEM data (to fill in the minimum bounding rectangles outside the mapping) at 0.15 meters (0.5 foot) pixel resolution.  The imagery will be delivered in seamless tiles of reasonable size to facilitate use.<BR><BR>5.   Mapping:<BR>A digital terrain model will be compiled for each of the VTS sites using the new control and new aerial photography.  Since the new photography will be summer 'leaf-on', Contours at a 1 meter interval will be generated from the new digital terrain model data for each of the sites. Index contours will be labeled at regular intervals and spot elevations will be placed in flat areas, on saddles and tops. The DTM data, the contours, and the orthophotography will be delivered in a format compatible with ESRI, ArcGIS 9.31.<BR><BR>6.   Metadata:<BR>Existing metadata will be updated to reflect changes in photography and methodology. (Note: the TNARNG GIS Section must provide the contractor with a copy of the existing metadata files for the updated files to be consistent in format with the current dataset.)<BR><BR>7.   Schedule:<BR>New aerial photography will be acquired within 3 weeks of notice to proceed (weather permitting).<BR>Ground control, digital terrain models, contours and orthophotography will be delivered within 90 days of notice to proceed.<BR><BR>8.   Final Deliverables:<BR>Once all conditions are met and preliminary orthophotography and mapping have been approved, the digital files will be burned to DVD.  Two copies of each disk will be provided.  The deliverables will include:<BR><BR>"	Digital orthophotos in Mr SID and TIFF format with associated FGDC compliant metadata in XML and text formats (Individual Tiles and Sheets of all 5 sites);<BR>"	An ArcInfo 9.31, SDS/FIE, version 2.6, compliant Geodatabase also including planimetrics for all 5 sites in with the elevation (Environmental grade or 1 Meter) contour lines - feature class, containing the 1 meter generated contours of each of the VTS sites;<BR>"	A detailed ground control report with descriptions and GPS coordinates.<BR><BR>9.   Correspondence:<BR>All correspondence concerning this project will contain the contract number and/or task order number.  A status report detailing progress will be provided every 30 days via email.<BR><BR>Note:  All bids will include a recap of all items contained in the (Introduction and scope, Aerial Photography, Ground Control, orthophotography, mapping, Metadata, Schedule, and final deliverables) depicting exactly <BR>what the bidder intends to provide, to the meet the needs of and to ensure that they understand the requirements of the bid and have addressed all items listed in this SOW.  The bid will be formatted as above on company stationery.   Additionally, bidder must provide proof of USGS camera calibration that has been accomplished within the past 3 years. Attached you will find PDF, Maps for general reference as an aid to bidding this project.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is twofold:  (1) to answer additional questions posed by a potential quoter; and (2) to extend the due date for responses.

Questions posed by a potential quoter, and responses:

1)       In regard to the X-Y stage in section 1  What is the load that the XY stage must carry?

Answer:  The stage will be carrying loads in the plane of travel.  The stage will be oriented vertically to the ground, and will have to support vertical weight loads as specified.

2)      Section 1.2.1  Our stages/amplifiers are plug in compatible with most NI controllers.  What do you mean by fully integrate.

Answer:  Plug in compatibility is sufficient to prove "full integration" with an NI system.

3)      Section 1.1.4  Do you have a velocity stability specification?  

Answer:  There is no velocity stability specification.

4)      Section 2.1.6  Is the 70kg listed the physical load or is there a press force?  If so, how much? Is the load centered on the carriage or offset? 

Answer:  The load will be a gravity load (perpendicular to the plane of travel), and it will be offset.  I am not familiar with the term "press force," but the load will be approximately 35 kg of dead load and up to 35 kg of live load.

5)      Section 2.1.5  Do you have a velocity stability specification?  

Answer:  There is no velocity stability specification.

6)      Section 4.1.1  It will be difficult to guarantee 2microns of accuracy for the Non load bearing stage using a stepper motor.  Can you use the NI PXI 7344 controller instead?  This controller can run both step motors and servo motors, so the other axes could be outfitted with step motors while the non-load bearing stage would have  a closed loop servo.  

Answer:  New boards and controllers can be purchased if need be.  If the specification is written such that the 2 microns of accuracy are guaranteed only with a servo controller, that will be acceptable.

7)      Section 4.1.3  - What kind of evidence are you looking for?

Answer:  Proof that plug-and-play compatibility exists with NI software/hardware will be sufficient.

The due date and time for submission of quotations is hereby extended to 3:00 p.m. on Friday, August 28, 2009.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged and in full effect.

<CONTACT>Frederick J. Washington, Phone 703-284-1926, Email washingtonfj@state.gov
<DESC>The Department of State Bureau of Administration, Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for assuring the Departments compliance with the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts (FOIA/PA) and other information access provisions.  Specifically, A/GIS/IPS processes FOIA/PA requests for information in Department of State records through their full request processing life cycle - from receipt of the request to final response to the requester and through appeal and litigation if necessary.  This project will allow IPS to process requests under the FOIA/PA in an efficient and appropriate manner, and achieve tangible, measurable improvements in FOIA/PA processing, as mandated in E.O. 13392 and the OPEN Government Act of 2007.  Additionally, this project will allow the Department of State to both process appeals of FOIA requests and respond to FOIA litigation demands.  A/GIS/IPS also provides centralized administration and coordination of special document production requests on behalf of the Secretary of State in response to discovery/court orders, Congressional oversight committees, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), special investigatory bodies, and other document production requests as mandated by the Secretary or the President.  These contract personnel, integrated with permanent, trained IPS staff, will assist with backlog reduction.

Under the directions and guidance of the pertinent Branch or Division Chief, provide project management, case processing, research, review, information analysis, appeals processing support, litigation support, and special document production support to the Office of Information Programs and Services, Requester Liaison and Statutory Compliance and Research Divisions.

It is intended that this requirement be solicited a 100% small business set-aside.  The National American Individual Classification Standard (NAICS) code for procurement is 561110.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will require the submission of a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The award shall be made to the contractor whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  This means that the offerors technical/Management Solutions/Approach, key personnel and resumes and past performance together are more significant than cost.  The work under this contract will be classified as Secret.  All personnel performing on the contract must favorably possess a secret clearance at time of award and maintain a clearance at the level of secret for the duration of the contract.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 6 each Meter, Radiation Hazard, L-3 Communications-Narda Microwave East Model No. NBM-520,&nbsp;NSN: 6625-01-492-3940; ASN: R400-SE46, which replaces the EMR-20. The&nbsp;EMR-20&nbsp;is currently used to maintain the WSR-88D weather surveillance radars commonly know as NEXRAD. The direct Narda replacement for this model is Model NBM-520 Broadband Field Meter and Model EF 0392 E-Field Isotropic Probe. NEXRAD is a joint program involving the Department of Commerce (National Weather Service), Department of Defense, and&nbsp;Department of Trasnportation (Federal Aviation Administration).&nbsp; Approval for all common and peculiar support equipment types is accomplished by the Radar Operations Center (ROC) in Norman, OK. THe&nbsp;ROC will test the NBM-520 and EF 0392 for use on tNEXRAD to insure compatibility and functionality with the obsolete EMR-20. In order to gain the most benefit from the shared resources of the agencies, like support equipment must be approved and used at all sites. Such commonality reduces procurement, calibratio, training, documentation, sparing, and repair costs for the following reasons: 1) a minimum of 100 of the EMR-20 meters have already been purchase and issued to NWS NEXRAD sites; 2) The EMR-20 is being used at the primary operational and technical support facility, ROC. Its technical assistance hotline must be able to coach technicians through troubleshooting activities using a standard fram of reference; 3) The EMR-20 is described in the published NEXRAD maintenance procedures; 4) The EMR-20 is being used at the National Weather Service Training Center to train maintenance personnel; and 5) Non-standarized equipment is more expensive to support in the Consolidated Logistics Supply system due to the costs to catalog, stock, maintain, and supply mutiple items of the same item. These&nbsp;items are&nbsp;being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO.&nbsp; The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is L3 Communications - Narda Microwave East, 435 Moreland Road, Hauppauge, NY 11788.&nbsp; The Government believes it is in their best interest to acquire these meters from L3 Communications in order to support standardization of support tools within the NEXRAD network thereby reducing the support load for maintaining additional equipment configurations. However, all proposals received within 5 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product. Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified product. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability by sending an email message to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax the information with an email address to telephone number 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian.
