It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<ARCHDATE>03232012
<CONTACT>Dennis Campbell Contract Specialist 7022938569     dcampbell@usbr.gov;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement to retrofill the low voltage (480Volts) Station Service Switchgear for the hydro-electric power plant at Headgate Rock Dam, Arizona.  The dam is located approximately one mile north of Parker, Arizona in La Paz County on the Colorado River Indian Reservation and is operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  The Bureau of Reclamation provides engineering and procurement support to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at Headgate Rock Dam.
Through a retrofill, Reclamation expects to improve the functionality, reliability, and most importantly, the safety of the 480 Volt station service switchgear.  The switchgear has two ABB LKE 1600 electrically operated main circuit breakers.  One of the two main LKE 1600 circuit breakers was replaced with an ABB, RMAX 1600amp, Low Voltage Roll-in circuit breaker.  During testing operations of the RMAX circuit breaker and subsequent re-installation of an LKE 1600, BOR switching guidelines were not followed and cubicle safety devices malfunctioned allowing a closed breaker to be installed resulting in breaker and cubicle damage and flash burn injuries to a Reclamation Electrician.  There exists a real concern about a possible design flaw with the circuit breaker control system and cubicle safety devices and the fact that the re-installation of the LKE 1600 was allowed while it was in the closed position.
Reclamation is seeking current state-of-the-art solutions in circuit breaker technology for the replacement of the circuit breakers and the associated cubicle/cradle hardware in order to increase the safety of racking operations and to mitigate the arc flash hazard.  The contractor will be required to furnish all labor, equipment, materials and incidentals necessary to design, manufacture and install all retrofill components within an allotted outage period.  The contractor will be required to perform a qualified retrofill design for the low voltage switchgear circuit breakers and related components.  The switchgear must be compatible in form, fit and function with the current switchgear and cradles in the Headgate Rock Dam power plant.  Reconditioning of the existing circuit breakers and the existing cubicles/cradles is not acceptable and will not be considered.  Remanufacturing of the existing breakers and cubicles/cradles to "like new" condition is not acceptable and will not be considered.
The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price construction contract.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  This acquisition, when announced, will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 335313, Switchgear and Switchboard Apparatus Manufacturing.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 335313 is 750 employees.  This solicitation is unrestricted.  
It is anticipated the solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP), will be issued on or about April 25, 2011.   Responses are due thirty days after issuance.  The RFP will include evaluation factors such as technical approach, relevant experience, past performance, and price.  It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded.  The estimated contract award date is June 1, 2011.  However, all dates in this announcement are subject to change.
No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov.  The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD if the FedBizOpps (FBO) web site becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register at the FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the FBO website after issuance download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Offerors are required to have a current registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) intends to award a contract to the ALS Association (ALSA) on a negotiated noncompetitive basis to promote the National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Registry to ALS patients, family members, caregivers, clinical staff, and the ALS community. This effort requires an organization with a nationwide network of ALS clinics, centers, and local chapters. Task requirements primarily include 1) development of an educational registry toolkit, 2) identification of ALS patients on a national level to increase awareness of the registry, 3) providing registry access to patients through a nationwide network of ALS clinics, centers, and local chapters, and 4) publicizing the registry to ALS patients through existing research/non-research programs. ALSA is the only organization that can perform the full scope of this requirement, primarily because of their nationwide access to ALS patients, databases, medical records, and their networked organizational affiliation with ALS clinical research communities. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541990. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered. A determination not to compete based on responses received, and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>The Shallow Water Agile Submarine Hunting (SWASH) program intends to develop ASW surveillance and cued search capability for shallow water littorals without the use of traditional acoustics or sonar. DARPA seeks the widest range of possible sensing solutions to achieve this goal. The best solutions will allow for operations to be useful across all phases of conflict. The expectation is that sensing solutions with low size, weight, power, and cost offer the greatest opportunity for flexible integration into unmanned airborne platforms.  This BAA solicits proposals for studies and technology assessments to understand the span of potential solutions. A subsequent BAA may follow to support discovery and development efforts.<br /> <br />For proposals to be considered, eligible proposers must have at least a secret facility clearance at the date of issue for this BAA, and evidence of the capability to conduct secret level research. Proposers are strongly encouraged to review the classified addendum to this BAA before considering a proposal submission. Section 4.1 and Appendix 2 to DARPA-BAA-11-41 provide the instructions to request the addendum materials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203, to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 26.85pt dotted 60.45pt 275.5pt 329.25pt 409.9pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pedestrian safety and bicyclist safety are two of several behavioral areas for which NHTSA has developed comprehensive programs to meet its injury reduction goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The major components of pedestrian safety programs are education, enforcement, and outreach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those three approaches are also applied to bicyclist safety programs, with legislative efforts added for further support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHTSA encourages bicycling as an alternate mode of transportation to motor vehicle travel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, increasing safe bicycling and walking behavior is promoted as a positive contributor to the quality of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But an increase in these behaviors often means an increase in exposure to potential risk of collision with motor vehicles, underscoring the need to have in place aggressive pedestrian and bicyclist safety programs to keep</p>
<p>injuries on a downward trajectory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This in turn requires periodic data collection to assess whether the programs continue to be responsive to the public's information needs, behavioral intentions, attitudes, physical environment, and other factors that contribute to safety while walking or bicycling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent survey of pedestrian and bicyclist attitudes and behavior was conducted in 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That survey provided program planners and community leaders with detailed information on walking and bicycling behavior, level of support for facilities assisting those activities, and awareness of safety issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the information is in need of updating, especially given recent programs and initiatives to increase walking and bicycling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project will provide that update by conducting the 2012 National Survey of Bicyclist and Pedestrian Attitudes and Behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>This project will ascertain the scope and magnitude of bicycle and pedestrian activity and the public's behavior and attitudes regarding bicycling and walking by conducting a national telephone survey of a randomly selected sample of persons ages 16 years and older.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The project will also determine whether the level of bicycling and walking has changed since the 2002 administration of the survey.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Hassan Albacha-Hejazi clinic is one of few clinics able to collect data and biological specimens from families with a history of oral clefts. In order to ensure detection of all important genetic affects, data collection from multiple families and family members are needed to improve the power of the study.  Dr. Hassan Albacha-Hejazi, of the IBN Al-Nafees Hospital in Damascus, Syria, has identified additional new families from Syrian individuals which will provide a larger sample pool.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases.  The Division=s research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.  Research also includes planning and conducting clinical trials to test DNA-based methods for treatment and perhaps the cure of such diseases.  Researchers collect and study families in which important diseases are inherited as well as, translate basic science advances into effective, reliable, and cost effective DNA and cytogenetic-based diagnostics.  This contract covers work to be performed as part of a continued collaborative effort under protocol OH97-HG-N035 approved by the NHGRI Institutional Review Board. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH is conducting a study of the inherited susceptibility to oral clefts, with emphasis on non-syndromic oral clefts. 

The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis, association analysis and gene mapping strategies.  Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease. As such, clinical data, family history data and blood samples from individuals in large families with multiple individuals affected with oral clefts is needed. Large families with multiple living affected family members are rare in the United States, given todays small average sibship size, and thus it is important to obtain data on such families from countries where such families are more common. In the Syrian Arab Republic, family sizes are large and intergeneration times are much shorter than in the U.S. 
These services are needed since it would not be feasible, either logistically or financially, to bring the members of the participating families to the U.S to be seen at the NIH and investigators at the NIH have no way to identify families with multiple affected individuals who reside in the Syrian Arab Republic. A contract with a local clinician who has proven that he can enroll suitable families is the most efficient and most economical way to conduct this study.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the researchers dedicated to the study.  These services will be in the areas of: determination of eligibility, patient registration, clinical evaluation of family members, biological sample collection and shipment, recontact of previously studied family members as needed by the NIH scientists to update information or consents and to explain clinically relevant results if needed.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. 

The DIR-NHGRI- Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238 are connected to this clinical testing.  Under this protocol, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. To date, the Undiagnosed Diseases program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 15% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. Ongoing research continues to find diagnosis on the other patients who have been seen in the UDP to date.

Baylor Genetic Laboratories (BGL) is a CLIA-certified biochemical and molecular tests, expert interpretations, and prompt reporting of rare or new genetic disorders, specifically mitochondrial disorders. BGL is a diagnostic laboratory functioning as part of the Baylor academic medical center in Houston, TX. BGL has devoted its efforts exclusively to providing biochemical and molecular testing for genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, and mitochondrial diseases for clinical and research programs around the country. Most of the programs Baylor interacts with have complex clinical trials and/or patients with uncharacterized disorders like the patients seen here in the Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP). Accordingly, BGL organization, staff, facilities, and work methods have been developed for the purpose of supporting clinical diagnostics and research, resulting in a high level of specialized expertise.  BGL support the goals of the UDP.  BGL are unique because they have developed assays for multiple tissues (blood, urine, fibroblasts, muscle, liver and heart tissue), can perform complex biochemical and molecular testing for a large range of genetic disorders across the lifespan, plus have particular research and diagnostic expertise in mitochondrial diseases that is not offered elsewhere in the United States.

2.  The Contractor will provide unique services specific to complex mitochondrial disorders as well as deletion and duplications studies for multiple rare biochemical disorders that meets the program goals of the UDP.

3.  The Contractors Turn-around-time for UDP to receive results will be 2-4 weeks. 

4.  The Contractor will contact the UDP if any patient results need to be evaluated urgently for impact on caring for patients in the UDP.

5.  The Contractor will supply faxed copies of all patient reports for the study file and medical record. 

Government Responsibilities:

The Government will provide to the Contractor:

a.  The government will not furnish any government property to the vendor.
b.  Patient samples will include; isolated DNA, blood, urine, fibroblasts, skeletal muscle or liver tissue as the patient condition and evaluation warrants.
c.  The Government will send all patient samples via Fed-Ex within 24 hours of obtaining the samples to Contractor for testing

a.  Abnormal results will be provided via phone, with follow up fax, directly to the ordering Clinician who can plan appropriate follow up with other members of UDP caring for the patient/family impacted by the result(s).
b.  All confirmed abnormal diagnostic test results will be released to the referring clinician and patient/family.

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

Itemize all progress, management, financial and fiscal or other reporting requirements and the frequency of their generation, or specific dates when due.

1.  The Government will receive all written results of patient samples within 2-4 weeks of the Contractor receiving the patient samples.
2.  The Government will receive additional reports for any test added-on after the Contractor receives the original specimen.

This procurement is an 8(a) set aside for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) and is available to 8(a) concerns located nationwide.  This procurement uses Two-Phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award up to five (5) IDIQ construction contracts, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.3 to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.
  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractors. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be provided is design, construction, supervision, equipment, materials, labor, and all means necessary to provide complete and usable facilities at various locations within Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake area of responsibility, including Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore and Bridgeport, California.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in China Lake, California.
  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains two (2) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 36 months. The estimated maximum dollar value including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined, is $35,000,000.  Task orders will range between $100,000 and $4,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.
 The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered however during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardees under the contracts performance period. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

The Government intends to evaluate and award contract(s) without discussions. Offerors are advised that it is possible that an award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable qualifications, price, and technical terms.  Offerors are advised not to assume that they will be contacted or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.
  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or, if necessary, to conduct discussions, providing an opportunity for Offerors to revise their proposals.  In addition, if the Government determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Government may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:

Phase One of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 36.3, and the evaluation factors are: Factor 1  Experience of the Offeror and Offerors Team; Factor 2  Past Performance of the Offeror and Offerors Team; Factor 3  Safety; and Factor 4  Management Plan.
 After evaluation of Phase One proposals, the Contracting Officer will select up to seven (7) of the most highly qualified Phase One Offerors and request that only those Offerors submit Phase Two proposals. Unsuccessful Phase One Offerors will receive notice of their non-selection at the same time. Offerors are advised that the Offerors selected to proceed to Phase Two are not guaranteed receipt of a contract award.  Results will not be published in Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS). Phase One proposal submissions and evaluation for Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be carried over to Phase Two for the selected most highly qualified Phase One Offerors. PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS (PO) ARE ADVISED SELECTION FOR ADVANCEMENT INTO PHASE TWO MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED.

Phase Two of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 15.3, and the evaluation factors are: Factor 5  Engineering Solution (for Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001); and Factor 6 - Price (for PTO 0001).
 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals from the up to seven (7) Offerors selected in Phase One and will be evaluated in accordance with the Phase Two Evaluation Factors including the carried over Phase One evaluation of those selected Offerors.  Phase Two proposals will be accepted only from those Phase One Offerors who have been specifically invited by written notification from the Contracting Officer to submit a Phase Two proposal.  Phase One evaluation will be included in the Phase Two evaluations and in the determination of Best Value. The best value tradeoff source selection process as described in FAR Part 15 will be used for Phase Two to ensure selection of contractors evidencing the best overall capability to perform the anticipated work in a manner most advantageous to the government in accordance with established evaluation criteria.
 The government anticipates award will be made to up to five (5) responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the most highly qualified (advantageous) to the government, price and other factors considered.

These are replacement parts so must be the exact fit and function of existing supplies.  

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) requires these parts shipped complete within 10 days of award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY DESCRIPTION<br>OCCUPANT CENTRIC SURVIVABILITY<br><br>I.  DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>II.  TOPIC<br><br>The US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground Systems Survivability (GSS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential traditional and non-traditional sources and the status of the state-of-the-art technology that provide occupant protection and ground vehicle survivability during an underbody mine blast, underbody improvised explosive device (IED), vehicle rollover, and vehicle crash (front, side, and rear impact).  The Army seeks to enhance current and future Ground System Vehicles by providing enhanced protection for the driver, passenger, crew, and vehicle, while preserving the vehicle's payload, mobility, fuel efficiency, and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability-Durability (RAM-D) capabilities.  <br><br>The intent of the market survey is to gather information to assess the potential for TARDEC to integrate occupant protection technologies onto an ideal hull demonstrator that will meet a set of defined and measureable requirements.  These technologies should demonstrate the ability to be scalable, modular, and easily integrated onto a military vehicle.  Affordability, minimal weight, and small space claim are key attributes.  It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated to provide a synergistic protective effect.  The data gathered in the market survey will help define and influence the trade space and requirements of a follow-on Request for Proposal (RFP) for technology maturation released through the TARDEC Omnibus.  <br> <br>TARDEC is seeking the following technologies to enhance occupant protection and vehicle survivability during underbody mine blast, underbody IED, vehicle rollover, and vehicle crash (front, side, and rear impact).  A separate response for each system or technology is desired.<br><br>a.  Personal Protective Equipment technologies to reduce Soldier injuries sustained during an event.<br>b.  Interior technologies to enhance occupant protection, including seats, restraints, air bags, steering columns, steering wheels, knee bolsters, active bolsters, and energy absorbing materials designed to mitigate injury due to interior impacts and floor intrusion.<br>c.  Exterior technologies to enhance structural performance in an underbody blast or crash event; including underbody protection kits, panels, inserts and advanced materials or other novel technologies that minimize acceleration propagation through the vehicle.<br>d.  Sensing and electronic technologies that determine what type of event is occurring, activates the appropriate technologies, records, processes, and relays the information associated with the underbody or vehicle crash or both, including sensors, control modules, data acquisition system, and diagnostic modules.<br>e.  Technologies to suppress or mitigate, or both, internal and external vehicle fires.<br>f.  Technologies to retain cargo, gear, munitions including tie-downs, nets, and other novel ideas. <br>g.  Other novel technologies to enhance protection for the driver, passenger, crew, and vehicle in an underbody blast or vehicle crash event or both.  <br><br>III.  RESPONSES<br><br>Responses must be post marked by May 2, 2011 <br><br>Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to  DAMI_TARDEC_GSS_OCS@conus.army.mil and include name, phone, and email address for response.  Questions may be answered via email or phone.<br><br>a.

Warren, MI 48397-5000.<br><br>Please submit the relevant Classification Guide with all classified data. Participants with questions regarding the handling of classified data should send an email with contact information to lisa.m.lynch@us.army.mil Security Officer.  Participation in this market survey is completely voluntary.  If the Government seeks additional information that is not included in a submittal, TARDEC representatives may contact the participant for further information exchange.  Information developed as part of this market survey may be shared with US Army Research, Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands, and Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS) Project Manager for Tactical Vehicles (PM TV), Project Manager for Future Tactical Systems (PM FTS) (Provisional), and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) (e.g. Office of Naval Research, Marine Corps, etc.).<br><br><br>IV.  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION:<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:   <br> <br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br> <br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br> <br>3.  THE GOVERERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PROTECT UNMARKED DATA.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<br> <br>4.  Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br> <br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<br><br>

<DESC>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought Notice issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a Request for Proposals (RFP). <strong>DLA Troop Support is NOT requesting a quote or proposal in response to this notice</strong>. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by DLA Troop Support for any purpose. The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished pursuant to this RFI. The purpose for this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, this requirement. For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 335129 - Other Lighting Equipment Manufacturing and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.
<p>DLA Troop Support seeks your expression of interest and any suggestion regarding DLA Troop Support's desire to establish supply support of a: <strong>Light Set, Chart, Field (NSN 6230-01-503-3158). </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Component Information</span>: The Army's transition to modular brigades, which is one of the major initiatives of the Army's transformation plan for modernization, involves migrating the Army from a division-centric force designed to fight one or two potential major-theatre wars toward a modular, brigade-centric force that is expeditionary in nature and deployed continuously in different parts of the world. This transformation spreads platoon and team sized elements across the battlefield, such that the 24/7 availability of electrical power is not always possible, and as such, an alternative provision for lighting without Mobile Electric Power (MEP) is necessary. Many small Command Posts (CPs) need lighting within tents and facilities and do not have a generator available, and the use of candles and lanterns can be unsafe and present logistic problems (batteries, fuel, etc), leaving units to find substitutes that present more problems than they solve.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</span>:<strong> The Government has a need for portable battery powered illumination within operations centers, Command Posts (CPs), areas without other lighting, and for emergency and inspection purposes in a field environment when the use of generators is restricted or electrical power is unavailable. </strong>These light sets are also used during searches, inspections, field medical work, and urban operations, and provide a safer, longer duration, rechargeable lighting solution. There are numerous situations when running a generator is not advisable and connecting to a commercial power grid is not an option, but the work within a dark tent or shelter must continue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design and Construction</span>: The function of the Lighting Kit is to provide extended power, battery operated lighting at more than three times the life of a single battery charge/capacity. In a portable package, the soldier unit is able to charge up to 12 batteries at the same time, using any one of four different power sources. When battery powered lighting is required - four soldiers using belt packs can operate the 18 Volt (V) cordless floodlights and the 18V rotating headlights for at least nine hours each instead of the standard time provided by a single battery.</p>
<p><strong>This Lighting Kit requires two (2) Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) headlights and floodlights, twelve (12) battery packs, two (2) solar panels, four (4) belt packs, four (4) different "pig tail" power cords, a built-in controller/charger, spare bulbs and lens covers, all contained within an impact resistant, water-resistant storage/transport case on wheels. The transport case requires integrated recharging and battery maintenance management circuitry (i.e. the controller/charger), that can be recharged and powered using four different voltage sources: 12 VDC, 24 VDC, 110 VAC, and 220 VAC.</strong> The controller accepts electricity from the four different voltage sources and feeds it into the charger, which can charge and maintain up to 12 batteries at once. The soldier cannot connect a light directly to the controller/charger, because these lights can only be powered by a battery source (either from a single battery, or from the belt pack). To compensate for that, the kit includes four (4) triple battery belt packs that allow three of the 18V lighting batteries to be attached within each belt pack to power either the 18V cordless floodlight or 18V rotating headlight, providing 3X the lighting capability for four different soldiers at the same time. While a standard 18V battery powered lighting device has an estimated run time of about three hours, the belt packs allows the soldier to operate the Lighting Kit flashlights for nine or more hours from a single belt pack charge. <strong>The transport case is specially designed to fit in the rear of a HMMWV and has custom cut foam to safeguard the components during rough handling.</strong> The Light Set provides an instant inventory of lighting equipment, and contains a permanently affixed diagram showing the location of each component in its loaded position and includes identification data.</p>

<p>THE REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anticipates a requirement for Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) services for the renovation of Building 1 (B1R) on NIST's campus in Boulder, Colorado. The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million. The project is planned to be announced in the spring of 2011 with an award anticipated for the summer of 2011. The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $80,000,000.00. The performance period for this project is estimated at one thousand ninety five (1095) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The B1R project will provide a facility that will allow NIST to advance measurement science, standards and technology beyond current constraints. Electronic, optical, radiation, chemical and information technologies must be supported. The renovation will allow key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the B1R are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954.</p>
<p>The proposed NIST B1R project is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately three fourths of Building 1, including Wings 3, 4, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. The exterior work will include the building structure, roofing, doors and windows, exterior wall finishes, site utilities, and landscaping. The building is multi-storied and will be fully occupied throughout the renovation. This renovation will provide new renovated space of 150,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space and offices to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. There will be approximately fifty laboratories renovated and seventy office spaces. Both of these are areas are approximately seven hundred square feet. The laboratory space is Level III or class room 10,000. The high performance for B1R consists of enhanced temperature control to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor. The building will be occupied throughout the construction process. The CMc will be responsible for the move coordination, and the actual move of the tenants (approximately 500 employees) throughout the building, throughout the entire project.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will be lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The CMc will be responsible for locating the bus ducts in the service corridors which contain the chilled water, steam, and compressed air supplied from the Boulder site Central Utility Plant. Communication elements include infrastructure components including the telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include the fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction must comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>CMc:</p>
<p>The CMc shall provide pre-construction phase services and construction phase services. The CMc's contract is anticipated as a firm fixed price basic requirement for pre-construction phase services and optional requirements for construction phase services for the exterior work that includes building structure, roofing, doors and windows, exterior wall finishes, site utilities, and landscaping along with interior work that will be divided amongst the wings and sections of the building, which will be awarded with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) not to exceed $80,000,000 for all options. The four wings of the building (wings 3, 4, 5, 6, and the spine) include laboratory space and office space. The spine of the building only contains offices as well as the main thoroughfare for the utilities as they enter the building and are dispersed throughout the entire building.</p>
<p>Pre-Construction Phase Services shall include: but may not be limited to, review and evaluation of concept, design development and construction documents; constructability review; sustainable design review; consultation during construction document production; preliminary project schedule development; recommendations on phased construction; cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and identification of long-lead items. Also included in this phase is the CMc's development of a migration plan for Building 1 occupants emphasizing minimal impact to NIST's core mission during a multi-year phased construction. This plan and coordination will include the five hundred employees who currently occupy the building.</p>
<p>Construction Phase Services shall include, but may not be limited to; administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract), coordination of regular pre-construction and construction meetings; CPM scheduling; daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring of construction costs; record keeping; progress reporting; schedule control; inspections; testing; and other required supplemental LEED services. The CMc shall review all construction document submissions for constructability and ensure conformance to the project budget. The CMc shall review A-E cost estimates, shall provide independent cost estimates and recommend adjustments to the estimates or the design to assure that the project stays within budget. The CMc shall provide NIST with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>
<p>If the requirement is set aside for small business, the awardee shall comply with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996), which states in relevant part, "(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for...(3) General construction. The concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees."</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Any interested small business, 8(a), HUBZone , service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or woman owned concerns shall submit its capability statement no later than Tuesday, April 26, 2011, at 12:00 p.m. Mountain Time to the following address:</p>

<p>Background <br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the US and around the globe search the Library's online information resources more than one billion times each year. Large data sets are also frequently exchanged among NLM and its research partners domestically and internationally. <br />The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) of the National Library of Medicine provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences in support of the research and management programs offered through the NLM.</p>
<p>OCCS develops, operates, and maintains the backbone computer network and facilities, and supports, guides, and assists other NLM components in local area networking. The Division provides professional programming services and computational and data processing facilities to meet NLM program needs; operates and maintains the NLM Network Operations and Computing Facility; designs and develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses and seminars, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS helps to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available throughout all of the organizations comprising NLM. The Division also serves as a technological resource for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs. The Division promotes the application of High Performance Computing and Communication to biomedical problems, including image processing and information security.</p>
<p>Objectives<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to provide high speed Internet connectivity to the National Library of Medicine's network which is located in Bethesda, Maryland.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis<br />Title: Containerized Flight Training Devices (CFTD) 9-16
<p>1) Requirement: <br />The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, has a requirement to provide training solutions that satisfy specific V-22 training requirements.<br />The Government seeks responses from interested parties to determine an acquisition strategy for the future procurements of Marine Corps MV-22 Block C Containerized Flight Training Devices (CFTDs) 2F200-9 through 2F200-16. CFTDs are self-contained units, which house a non-motion simulator, a host computer, a visual display system, and an instructor operating station. Currently, 8 CFTDs, all in a MV-22 Block B configuration, are either fielded or are planned for delivery at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, NC, MCAS Miramar, CA, and MCAS Futenma, Japan. The CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 effort includes implementing a systems approach to training, analyzing requirements, producing, delivering, and installing up to eight CFTDs in a Block C MV-22 aircraft configuration. The requirement will also include a brief support period following device delivery. CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 will simulate MV-22 Block C aircraft operation to the fidelity requirements identified in the system specification. CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 will be new devices insofar as they are in a new aircraft configuration; however, CFTDs 2F200-9 through 2F200-16 must incorporate the common baseline software that is run on currently-fielded MV-22 CFTDs.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing construction services related to the following project for Energy and Structure Repair, Consolidate Subcomponent OPS Building 178, Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  The magnitude of this Procurement is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

Description of proposed project:  
This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential firms capable of providing services for the stated project.   This project structurally repairs and modernizes the former Naval Shipways (Bldg. 178) to create a consolidated state-of-the-art Shipyard industrial material handling facility supporting optimized flow of critical submarine components during Ship overhaul evolutions; increasing efficiency while decreasing waste, and improving ship operational availability.
 The facility will revolutionize component and equipment tracking, storage, and retrieval by incorporating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to wirelessly indentify and track assets throughout the supply chain network from back shop manufacturing locations to waterfront ship production. The facility will incorporate smart-skin technology that utilizes the former Shipway's incredible surface area and ideal southern exposure for photovoltaic (PV) power generation and solar thermal heating. Flexible thin-film 128-watt solar panels intergraded into a light-weight roofing membrane will provide 700,000 KWH/yr of electricity, in addition to a PV integrated window wall system matching the historic pattern of fenestration, while providing an electrical output of 100,000 KWH/yr.
 

Structural modifications will eliminate seismic and wind loading code deficiencies, restore the lifting and handling capabilities within Bay #3, provide waterside stabilization supporting barge delivery, upgrade the crane rail system, and provide new concrete flooring to increase the existing storage capacity. High efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems will further support the LEED Core & Shell certification for this 115,000 sqft facility. Also, this renovation will relocate a critical Shipyard steam line servicing 3/4 of industrial plant infrastructure thereby increasing the long term reliability of all ship servicing.

All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the state of Arizona to include Luke Air Force Base. A PLA is defined as a prehire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br><br>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br>(2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:<br><br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar, large scale military construction contracts at Luke Air Force Base? if yes, decribe how a PLA will acheive economy and efficiency in the procurement, produce labor management stability, and/or ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards? If no, describe why?<br><br>2. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br><br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? How?<br><br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br><br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br><br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br><br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District contract?<br><br> <br>Please limit your responses to no more than two (2) to Three (3) pages in length.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available uniform material fabric that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Headquarters is conducting market research to determine manufacturers and suppliers that may provide cloth according to the attached purchase description for wind resistant poplin nylon/cotton cloth, dyed to match Coast Guard Blue 3362. The purchase description for rip stop cloth is one class only. It shall have a durable soil, stain, and wrinkle resistant finish. See attached purchase description.
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your fabric's capabilities for meeting the product description. Also, responses should state approximate lead-time for acquiring your fabric. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the fabric.</p>
<p>Please respond to the following questions:<br />(1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? <br />(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?<br />(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?<br />(4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? <br />(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?<br />(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? <br />(7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? <br />(9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this request for information (RFI) the USCG will use the information to confirm if there are multiple mills providing fabric that could meet the USCG fabric requirement. This will be used for determining the availability of sources for future operational dress uniform (ODU) fabric requirements. Responses to this RFI are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. The USCG does not directly purchase fabric under the attached product description but incorporates the product description into the ODU uniform requirement. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of response is March 31, 2011, 4:30 p.m., EST. E-mail responses are preferred and may be sent to jim.dawson@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG23-11-I-9407 in subject line.</p>

<DESC>Air Combat Command Acquisition Management and Integration Center intends to award a combination Fixed Price/Cost Plus Award Fee modification to Battlespace Flight Systems, LLC IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source &amp; No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to extend MQ-1 Predator organizational level (O-level) maintenance support services of contract FA4890-07-C-0006. The extension start date is 1 October 2011 through award of follow-on contract with an estimated award date of 31 December 2012. The contract was competitively awarded to Battlespace Flight Services, LLC to provide organizational-level (O-level) maintenance, weapons loading, logistics, equipment, and aerospace ground equipment (AGE) support at Creech AFB, NV and forward-deployed locations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and communications reach back support at Ramstein AB Germany. The contract extension must be operational on 1 October 2011 to meet current requirements at Creech AFB, Whiteman AFB, Ramstein AB, and various forward-deployed locations. All efforts on contract will carry over from the FY11 effort. There is also a contract option for MQ-1 O-level maintenance support at Grand Forks AFB, ND for approximately 40 sorties/320 flying hours per month with a tentatively scheduled start date of June 2012. Two potential new MQ-1 deployed locations projected to support up to 3 combat air patrols (CAPs) each, will be held as contract options until operational requirements dictate execution. As a result of this action, the contract value will increase in excess of $100M and will permit the continuation of performance of the current contract while the requirement is being recompeted. The NAICS code for this procurement is 488190, Other Support for Air Transportation. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and no solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Office. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement detailed above. Information received by close of business 31 March 2011 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to extend services.  This action will result in a modification to the current contract, F04684-03-C-0050 with InDyne, Inc., 11800 Sunrise Valley Dr, Ste 250, Reston, VA for a period of sixteen (16) months.  The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 Oct 2011 through 31 Jan 2013.  This extension is needed to satisfy the WROCI requirement until the award of the Launch & Test Range Systems Integrated Support Contract (LISC), solicitation #09-49, can be completed.  The LISC combines three current contracts:  WROCI, Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) and Space Lift Range Systems (SLRS).   

The WROCI contract provides Western Range operations and maintenance; support services; training; command, control, communications, information and computer systems services; testing, modifying and installing communications, electronic and security systems at launch facilities, launch control centers test facilities and all 14 AF alarmed facilities located in Bldgs 10577 and 8401.  This effort provides network equipment and software maintenance, and direct customer support for user access to, and information transfer, over the Non-Classified internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Local Area Network (LAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR) and launch agencies by providing qualified personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, specialized test equipment, supervision, and other items and services as necessary.  The WROCI requires an innovative, integrated, flexible and effective management approach and the contractor must provide technical support in a planned and coordinated manner which will ensure essential Western Range support systems are ready to support user requirements, and cause no impact to Range program schedules due to equipment degradation, failures, system problems or reprioritization of program requirements.  The wide variety of support systems involves careful workload planning and scheduling of resources to identify and resolve technical systems problems.  The contractor will be required to maintain and operate Department of Defense (DoD) computers, radios, communication centers, voice and data switching, and common-user telephone systems, interface with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and assess the impact of integrating new Communication systems into the WR and base-wide infrastructure.  The contractor will be required to operate the Network Control Center (NCC) and perform site observation, security services, operate sensitive unclassified destruct facility, and escort and data courier services as defined in this statement of work.  The WR encompasses a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean.  Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites.  Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements.  The WR receives and provides Range support to and from various agencies, to include but not limited to, the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45th Space Wing (45 SW), 452nd Flight Test Squadron (452nd FTS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), and Reagan Test Site (RTS).  The 30 SW is responsible for providing Range capability to conduct and support activities for spacelift, ballistic missile, and aeronautical programs.  The WR is part of the Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports DoD, NASA, commercial, and other user launch, orbital tracking, and test programs.  

The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) operations described above.  This sixteen-month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.    This extension of services will extend the end date of the period of performance from 30 Sep 2011 to 31 Jan 2013.  This extension of services will further allow for the future competitive procurement for these services under the LISC to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor.  InDyne, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for extension of these services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services.  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension.  A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services.  Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Shirley Castillo at shirley.castillo@vandenberg.af.mil and Claudia Boga at claudia.boga@vandenberg.af.mil.

These companies are the only known contractors that can provide continuity of care with the health care workers who have been privileged to work at the aforementioned sites and are trained and familiar with hospital procedures.
  The lead-time required for an alternate contractor to recruit and hire a replacement staff, submit Individual Professional Files for each health care worker and for the sites to complete the privileging process does not exist prior to the required 01 June 2011 start date.  Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement in a proposal to this office by 2:00 pm, EDST, on Wednesday, 30 March 2011 by email to Acquisitions@med.navy.mil (reference code 023J in subject line) or telefaxed to 301-619-6793.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  No documents exist and no further information is available at this time.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE DARPA-SN-11-33, SWASH PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Shallow Water Agile Submarine Hunting (SWASH) program on April 7, 2011 from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM in Arlington, VA at the Capital Conference Center (703) 351-8200, located at: 3601 Wilson Blvd., 6th floor, in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-11-41. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the SWASH program; and to promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for exchanges with the government team as described in the BAA.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />The SWASH program intends to develop ASW surveillance and cued search capability for shallow water littorals without the use of traditional acoustics or sonar. DARPA seeks the widest range of possible sensing solutions to achieve this goal. The best solutions will allow for operations useful across all phases of conflict. The expectation is that sensing solutions with low size, weight, power, and cost offer the greatest opportunity for flexible integration into unmanned airborne platforms.  The BAA will solicit proposals for studies and technology assessments to understand the span of potential solutions. A subsequent BAA may follow to support discovery and development efforts.  This proposers-day will allow industry to view a briefing on the concept and ask questions of the government team.<br /> <br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  <br />All participants must pre-register for the conference no later than 12:00 PM EDT April 5, 2011.  Please include the subject "SWASH Proposers' Day" in all submissions and correspondence.

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and develop the Disposable Point-of-Care Testing Device technology for Nucleic Acid Amplification and Colorimetric Detection.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Background</span></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Point-of-Care (POC) testing is an emerging market that promises giant leaps for medical diagnostics. Currently, many tests for disease diagnosis are performed at centralized laboratories and utilize expensive instrumentation. The time and expense of transporting samples and purchasing large instruments for testing create a market need for devices and tests that can provide diagnoses in the clinic or even at the home of the patient.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While simplified tests for pregnancy, glucose, drugs of abuse, and other protein biomarkers have used techniques such as lateral flow for many years, testing for infectious diseases have required PCR-based assays for analysis of nucleic acids. PCR requires highly purified samples as well as complex instrumentation for detection of fluorescent tags. The current market for infectious disease point-of-care testing is valued at $384 million by Frost and Sullivan and expected to grow quickly. The next advances in point-of-care testing for infectious disease require breakthroughs in assays and devices designed to allow similar detection sensitivity to instrument-based PCR detection, but are low-cost and disposable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Description</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have developed a point-of-care testing device and assay conditions for infectious diseases. The device is simplified in its design, allowing sample acquisition, preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection all in one tube.<span>&nbsp; </span>Detection of a Reverse Transcriptase Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) reaction is colorimetric, requiring no expensive detection instrumentation and allowing detection by eye.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Q1450110005 is hereby cancelled.  The National Park Service feels that reasonable time was not given for contractors to schedule and complete the sandblasting and re-coating of the tender water tanks for Golden Spike National Historic Site before the operating season begins.
The sandblasting and re-coating job will be advertised in the near future so that the job can be performed after the closing of the operating season, leaving adequate time for the contractor to complete the project.
We sincerely appreciate the time and effort your firm has expended in competing for this project.  We encourage you to submit proposal/bids on future National Park Service projects.

<DESC>Digital Imager Working Group Special Notice<br /><br />Synopsis: <br />The Optical Systems Group (OSG) of the Range Commanders Council (RCC) seeks industry participation in the Digital Imager Working Group. The working group seeks to gather industry comment and input on the selection, configuration, and integration of a standards based file format and data transmission protocol for the purposes of ingest, analysis, exchange, transmission, and archival of uncompressed digital motion imagery. The Working Group also seeks to gather industry comment and input on the selection, configuration, and integration of a standards based command and control programming interface for the purpose of providing a common programming interface for use with the high speed video cameras owned by the DoD ranges. <br />The Working Group, in coordination with the DoD Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) is considering the adoption of the Material Exchange Format (MXF) for required use as a file format standard for applications using uncompressed digital motion imagery within the Department of Defense. The use of MXF for uncompressed digital motion imagery is defined in the Society of Motion Picture &amp; Television Engineers (SMPTE) 377M, 379M, 384M and other related documents. The Working Group will also evaluate the use of other industry standards, such as, the GigE Vision data transmission protocol and the GenICam programming interface. <br />The desire for these standards is to adopt a file container, data transmission protocol, and common command &amp; control interface that provides consistency through the entire imaging chain from acquisition through archival when using uncompressed digital motion imagery. Currently a wide variety of custom and proprietary formats are leveraged for handling uncompressed imagery. This current state of configuration creates significant inefficiencies for the Test Ranges and other DoD users of uncompressed imagery. This working group will accept comment and provide coordination with the MISB to ensure RCC requirements are accounted for within the MISB adoption process. In addition, coordination will flow in the other direction to ensure appropriate RCC compliance with MISB standards as they are adopted.<br />This Digital Imager Working Group will hold meetings at least twice annually. The meetings will be held in conjunction with RCC/OSG meetings and will be open to Government, Contractor, and vendor attendees. Participation is limited to technical personnel who will be expected to provide inputs and comments to the uncompressed file format process. The Working Group duration is expected to be 2 years with the first organizational meeting to be held during the week of May 2nd, 2011 in Park City, Utah, coincident with the Optical Systems Group meeting at this time and location. Future meetings will be held twice each year, again in conjunction with the OSG meetings, hosted by RCC member ranges. These meetings are generally held in April/May and October/November. Any additional meetings and/or teleconferences will be established and scheduled by the Working Group.
<p>The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice; nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any cost incurred (in developing the information provided or any cost incurred for participating in this Working Group).</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this Working Group, please respond via email to both of the points of contact named below on or before April 11, 2011.</p>

<SOLNBR>N0002411R4207
<ARCHDATE>06302011
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command will be conducting a Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day for the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer (DDG 51) Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) Electric Propulsion System (EPS) for Backfit Fuel Savings acquisition. The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an overview of the HED Program and an opportunity to gather more information prior to the Request for Proposals (RFP) being issued. A general session will be held for interested parties to obtain information from the Government program management team.  

The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations have identified fuel conservation and reducing fuel consumption leading to energy independence a top priority for the Navy.
  The large numbers and remaining service life of the DDG 51 Class ships provides one of the best opportunities for long term fuel savings.  The HED-EPS shipsets will include the propulsion motors, motor drives and the associated controls, interfaces, and mounting equipment that will be required to install the HED-EPS on DDG 51 Class ships.  When installed aboard a ship, the HED-EPS will permit the crew to turn off of one or more propulsion gas turbines and allow more efficient operation of the existing gas turbine generators, which will be generating electric power for the HED-EPS as well as all the existing ships electrical loads.  

The eventual acquisition may include the development of pre-production units for land based evaluation and options for the intended annual production.
  The intent of the Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day is to introduce a draft of the possible RFP text, review the Navy requirements trade study, and to review the present state of the performance specification for the HED-EPS, so that industry can become familiar with the considerations that are leading to the acquisition decisions.  Subsequent to the Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day, one-on-one meetings may be scheduled for direct industry feedback on the documents discussed and the status of the effort.  As this is not a solicitation, no attendee firm should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance.
 Questions and conversation that appears to steer in this direction will be discouraged.

Please limit attendance from each company to three individuals as the total attendance will be limited. Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens and must represent bona fide US Department of Defense (DoD) contractors as the presentation materials may include limited distribution information.  Evidence in the form of an executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to admission. Please pre-register via email to the following address: joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil no later than Friday November 5, 2010. Registration will be confirmed via a responding e-mail and failure to register will prohibit admittance.
  Please provide the individuals name, company, phone and e-mail address in addition to the DD 2345.  The Government intends to publish a list of attendees to encourage subcontracting opportunities.  Note: This is NOT a "bidders conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

Date: Wednesday, November 17, 2010

Time: Check-in at 8:00am; General Session from 8:30am to 2:30pm.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for SUbstance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the National Consortium of TASC Programs, Inc.
<p>Background: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) has a lengthy history (1990-present) of providing funding for the treatment of individuals in the criminal justice system who have substance use and/or mental health disorders. In the SAMHSA Strategic Initiatives which drive the agencies budgeting, planning, and programming, "Trauma and Justice" is listed as one of SAMHSA's program priority areas. CSAT currently is funding substance use treatment services to offender populations in two primary settings: treatment drug courts and offender reentry into the community.</p>
<p>The acronym "TASC" stands for Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities. TASC is a national program model that reduces addiction driven crime by linking local criminal justice systems to community-based treatment programs. The TASC model was initiated in 1969, as one of the federal responses to the rise of drug related crime. National TASC is the national membership organization serving the case-management professionals and it has 200 programs across the country. In the past, TASC has organized twelve successful national conferences. Given the value of the TASC model as an alternative to the incarceration, we believe support of this national meeting furthers SAMHSA's objectives of the knowledge exchange of screening, assessment, case management, and referral to treatment in order to more effectively treat the substance-using offender.</p>
<p>Purpose: This Purchase Order request is to provide technical expertise in the TASC case management model, selection of expert/practitioners to present on treatment, clinical, case management and offender reentry training topics at the 17th National TASC Ninth Annual Conference on Drugs and Crime, and to perform logistical support in the planning and implementation of this conference. The conference will be held at the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel, 1550 Court Place, Denver, Colorado. In addition to contract logistical support this purchase order will require expertise in the identification of expert/practitioners/researchers in the TASC model of offender case management and treatment referral. <br /><br />It is anticipated that four hundred people, including 170 participants from the SAMHSA Offender Reentry Program, presenters, and SAMHSA/CSAT staff, will attend the conference from the Criminal Justice, Treatment, Social Services, Legislative, academic, and drug research fields. The conference will be a forum for exchange of ideas and a showcase for the state-of-the-art technology and information on offender management, drug treatment programming, drug courts, offender re-entry, research, and information technology. As the theme implies, this year's conference will focus on the community partnerships that are necessary to ensure the recovery and reentry of prior offenders.</p>
<p>The conference will feature tracks on reentry and recovery support, evidence based practices-practical applications for improved results; improving family health through prevention; TASC and problem solving courts and technology, connectivity and community responses. Additional workshops will include family-focused programs, front-end diversion, working with other systems, and working with scarce resources. Through plenary sessions, panel discussions, and training workshops, participants and sponsors will learn about the latest innovations and developments in juvenile/criminal justice/mental health case management. In addition, conference attendees will have the opportunity to attend several pre-conference sessions for federal grantees and other subjects.<br /><br />Specific purposes for the Purchase Order include:</p>
<p>&#61507; Demonstrating SAMHSA's support for the TASC offender case management model concept through the 17th National TASC Conference on Drugs and Crime. This will be accomplished through the vendor recommending to SAMHSA's GPO the selection of qualified expert/practitioners in several criminal justice - behavioral health treatment and recovery services areas.</p>
<p>&#61507; Using this conference as a vehicle for more national recognition of and understanding of SAMHSA's Strategic Initiatives as they relate to the priority area of criminal justice programming. A central focus will be on SAMHSA's support for new approaches to criminal justice-substance abuse treatment through its justice portfolio of program initiatives, including offender reentry, and community corrections programs.</p>

<SUBJECT>Non-Denominational Individual & Family Recovery Resources Training (Phase VII)
<SOLNBR>SAM59884
<RESPDATE>040111
<CONTACT>Dormey Blankmann, Contract Specialist/Officer, Phone 3014437078, Fax 3014433238, Email dormey.blankmann@psc.hhs.gov - Julia C Savoy, Contract Specialist/Officer, Phone 301-443-1386, Fax 301-443-3238, Email julia.savoy@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Program Support Center, a Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using the Simplified Acquisition Producers to National Assoc for Children of Alcoholics.
<p>Background: Faith-based organizations have historically impacted communities and individual behavior. The local faith community is uniquely positioned to help persons affected by alcohol or drug addiction or members of their families break down the barriers they feel are impenetrable in seeking help for their problems. Issues of alcohol and drug misuse, dependency and addiction, and mental health conditions affect the counseling work and efforts to provide spiritual direction to hurting congregants. Yet, many congregation-based leaders currently have neither the full knowledge nor the skills to work in resolving these issues with individuals and families facing addiction-related problems and mental health conditions. But, with training and resources, the faith community can be an effective facilitator in finding the help and services needed; especially if they have at hand the necessary tools to help the individual and family begin recovery.</p>
<p>Providing the faith community with training, consumer-related education resource tools, and teaching them how to connect needed recovery-oriented resources within their local community, can help to facilitate efforts to reach persons who are suffering from their own or a family member's addiction within their congregation.</p>
<p>In addition, faith leaders can help to educate others in the congregation to assist in the reduction of prejudice and discrimination and the elimination of barriers associated with substance use disorders and mental health conditions and the achievement of SAMHSA's mission "to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities."</p>
<p>As with all HHS/SAMHSA activities and events, there will be consideration and emphasis to promote the interests of diverse ethnic and racial minority groups. These groups include African American, Asian Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indian, older Americans, adolescents and youth, individuals with co-occurring illness and the disabled community. In order to accomplish their goals, SAMHSA creates opportunities to join alliances with all levels of government agencies, the business community, recovery community, professional organizations and affiliates within the substance abuse treatment field. These relationships help to foster support to spread the word about the efficacy of treatment, as well as to eliminate disparities associated with substance use disorders and mental health conditions.</p>
<p>Goals and Reasons:</p>
<p>This initiative will work with, complement and enhance the effectiveness of existing SAMHSA/CSAT family and faith-based educational resources. Efforts to increase consumer-related outreach, training and educational material targeted to faith leaders can enhance their congregants' awareness about alcohol and drug problems. In addition, these materials provide clergy with appropriate information and congregation education materials to address these problems.</p>
<p>This effort complements the work started through SAMHSA/CSAT's Faith Initiative - "Clergy Guide" on alcohol and drug problems. This effort will bring the guide to life in each congregation through an in-house training program on how to implement the suggested steps mentioned in the clergy guide. The effort will also provide collateral materials for individuals and family members to intervene with appropriate treatment and support needed to recover from alcohol and drug addiction.</p>
<p>This initiative supports the SAMHSA Strategic Initiatives Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness and Public Awareness and Support.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements and Tasks - Statement of Work:</p>
<p>This initiative, Phase VII, will teach a cadre of multi-denominational clergy to expand their knowledge and understanding of the impact of alcohol and drug problems, to introduce resources available and useful strategies to intervene positively with affected congregants, including children.</p>
<p>In Phase VII, the goal remains to disseminate materials already developed and compile lessons learned for the respective faith communities (be it denominational, geographic or allied professionals) in order to directly reach the consumer in need of information and help regarding addiction, mental health conditions, intervention, treatment and recovery. The contractor will organize eight (8) clergy training programs in both metro and rural areas and will attempt to secure the participation of no less than 100 members of the clergy and allied faith social services providers for each one of the training programs. The eight (8) sites will be determined in collaboration with and approval by SAMHSA/CSAT. The proposed eight (8) target venues will include:</p>
<p>In Phase VII, the Clergy Education and Training Project&reg; of the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) propose to: <br />&bull; Conduct a one-day training event in eight communities that are diverse geographically, ethnically and racially, build on the lessons learned in the previous six phases, and disseminate and highlight the already created SAMHSA/CSAT materials. The goals of the training are (1) to impart information based on the SAMHSA document Core Competencies for Clergy and Other Pastoral Leaders In Addressing Alcohol and Drug Dependency and Its Impact on Family Members, and (2) to provide tools, strategies, materials and TA support to a minimum of 100congregational leaders in each of the eight communities, in a one-day training event, that will motivate and engage pastoral leaders to support efforts to reach directly to the consumer in need of information and help regarding addiction, mental health conditions, intervention, treatment and recovery both in their own congregations and in collaboration with other faith leaders in their communities. The (8) communities will be determined in collaboration with and the approval of CSAT/SAMHSA following NACoA research, and they will include at least one community serving a military base(s), one or more major metropolitan areas, one community with a high Hispanic population, and one serving rural areas.<br /><br />&bull; Continue its partnership with the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, and engage the Faith Partners as an additional partner in the trainings and as a resource to facilitate the implementation of congregational teams and to follow-up with the communities hosting the trainings.</p>
<p>&bull; Design and host a Webinar for current and previous participants as a refresher and motivator to re-energize work already begun and to engage persons not yet trained.</p>
<p>&bull; Engage NACoA affiliate organizations, community coalitions, and NCADD affiliate organizations, where appropriate, to support the local faith organizations and partners in the recruitment and venue support needed for a successful training event and follow-up educational programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Utilize existing pamphlets and posters, in both English and Spanish, designed and used in earlier Phases as well as the Core Competencies for Clergy and Other Pastoral Ministers in Addressing Alcohol and Drug Dependence and the Impact on Family Members, the CSAT booklet What Is Substance Abuse Treatment? And the resource manual of information, educational materials, tools, tips, articles and ad slicks for use in congregational bulletins and the local religious press.</p>
<p>&bull; Expand the effort with all participant congregations to promote Recovery Month and to use the Recovery Month webcasts as the basis for community and family education programs/discussion groups.</p>
<p>&bull; Engage local prevention and treatment resources and county/state substance abuse directors to provide information and resources for ongoing support to local congregations following the training.</p>
<p>&bull; Invite representatives of ministerial conferences across denominations to encourage participation from the planning stages to the continued distribution and use of the project's materials.</p>
<p>It is proposed to use the previous work and experience completed by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACoA) to facilitate this initiative. This training effort will use existing materials, such as publications and videos, repackage them for use at the congregational level across denominations, and provide the participants with information on how to recognize, address, and refer congregants and their families to treatment for substance use disorders. Training topics will also include understanding addiction and the importance of finding the support and help for the affected individuals and family members, and to empower them to initiate and sustain steps toward recovery. In addition, the initiative will create and conduct training programs for representatives of faith congregations in designated cities. These training programs will demonstrate to clergy how to use the materials effectively to provide support, direction and hope for their congregants and other consumers in these communities.</p>
<p>These materials will be provided directly to members of faith congregations to help support their individual and family efforts to address alcohol and drug problems, to intervene as appropriate, and to find the support they need to prevent or recover from alcohol and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Task I: Submit contract plan within 30 days of award of contract. Status reports will be due end of 1st quarter, mid-year, end of 3rd quarter and final report. The reports will include number of individuals trained; their participant evaluation results from the training; orders of materials from SHIN; training and resource materials used; nature of local partner groups for each site, and follow-up activities.</p>
<p>Task II: Review and update participant resource manual to include steps for implementing congregational-based recovery support teams.</p>
<p>Task III: Engage clergy leadership and local faith organization partners in eight (8) communities across diverse geographic and ethnic/cultural populations to include research and identifying appropriate sites. The final eight (8) site selections will be approved by the SAMHSA/CSAT project officer. Engage local organizations, including NACoA and NCADD affiliates to partner in planning, recruitment and venue for each site.<br />Broaden national partnerships to include the Faith Partners, in addition to the American Association of Pastoral Counselors. Facilitate planning meetings in each local community and initiate periodic planning conference calls with each. Provide graphics for flyers and brochures for all local partners to use for their training participant recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Task IV: Conduct a one-day training program in each of the eight (8) communities by providing training to leadership representatives of faith congregations in each designated city on how to establish a welcoming environment for impacted congregants and how to use the resources and SAMHSA materials effectively. Recruit 100 pastoral leaders to participate at each site.<br /><br />Task V: Develop and host a 1-hour Webinar as a refresher for previous participants from Phases I-IV and for those in this current Phase, engaging 100 participants. The Webinar materials must be provided to the project officer in advance.</p>

Therefore, an extension until 30 September 2011 to Contract W912DR-09-C-0081 is required to fullfil the mission of the ODASA (IH&P) and OACSIM for the program and project management services in order to maintain professional financial and real estate development services under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI), the Family Housing (FH),   Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH), and Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) programs.  This is not a request for solicitation.

NOTE: lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) requires budget consulting services.</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />The Mission of NIAMS is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases.</p>
<p>Need:<br />The NIAMS has a need for a contractor with expertise in NIAMS budget process to assist in the numerous budget activities related to analysis of data, development of budget models to test various funding scenarios, and development of electronic processes to improve workflow and enhance financial management capabilities. With shrinking resources and more complex database resources, it is critical for the Institute to restructure some of the current processes to improve efficiency</p>
<p>Scope of Tasks:<br />&bull; Work with the Scientific Information Technology Branch (SITB), the Grants Management Branch (GMB), and the QVR Development team to develop, customize, and improve reports that combine data from Institute and NIH information systems to enhance the Institutes financial management capabilities and facilitate analysis of extramural programs, particularly with regard to grants fiscal control. <br />&bull; Develop automated methodologies and/or systems to allow NIAMS to track the budget status of extramural funds by project and produce reports on a regular basis.<br />&bull; Develop an automated process for generating pay lists for competing grant applications in all extramural budget mechanisms.<br />&bull; Develop and maintain electronic briefing books for the Director's use at Congressional hearings and for reference by NIAMS staff.<br />&bull; Create and maintain an accurate and complete set of budget history tables for the Institute. Examples include: success rate, new investigators, Institute Initiatives (RFA's), co-funds, and obligation history by program.<br />&bull; Develop electronic file system for storing current and historical budget data.<br />&bull; Develop budget models for projecting various outcomes based on input of different budget scenarios.<br />&bull; Develop slides for budget presentations to Advisory Council members and other groups as needed.<br />&bull; Develop and set up electronic formats for NIAMS to prepare various budget formulation tables and exhibits. Example include: calculation of Intramural and RMS mandatory tables, Basis/Applied Research, Object Class worksheet, commitment base calculation, summery of changes, mechanism tables, etc.<br />&bull; Develop "best practices" instructions and procedures for use by new and junior staff.</p>
<p>Cost Considerations<br />Cost/price is a selection factor. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price, but not to the exclusion of consideration of cost or price. The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br />The Government intends to evaluate quotes and establish one contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial&nbsp;quote should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all&nbsp;quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept an other than the lowest cost/priced quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.</p>
<p>The contractor will be evaluated on the following criteria (100 points total):</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in the federal budget process (25 points)<br />&bull; Ability to exercise judgment and work independently to prepare recommendation to the Chief Budget Officer, and NIAMS senior leadership (25 points)<br />&bull; Analytical skills(25 points)<br />&bull; Expertise in developing and managing the NIAMS budget electronic filing system (10 points)<br />&bull; Expertise in the NIH/NIAMS extramural mechanisms and grant analysis (15 points)</p>
<p>FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008); FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (AUG 2009); FAR 212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (JUN 2010); FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUL 2010) is included with the following additional clauses: FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT2003); and FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (APR2008).</p>

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determine at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>Brand Name Justification


FLENUMMETOCCEN has used the Intel Compilers on its systems for years. Intel Compiler Suite for Linux is approved in DADMS and assigned to FLENUMMETOCCEN in MAAD. To switch compilers would require finding an acceptable replacement software application, gaining approval to use it, and re-training our personnel to use the new tool.  This is likely to be much more expensive than merely buying support service renewal for the already installed items.  Plus, applications that run on Intel processors (such as ATOS2) that have been compiled using Intel compilers are up to 30% more efficient in execution than when compiled with other brand compilers.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>The Offeror shall follow the format and instructions below in preparing its proposal.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To facilitate proposal evaluation, the offeror shall submit three (3) copies of their Price Proposal as Volume I and three (3) copies of their Technical proposal as Volume II. These volumes must be clearly marked as "Price Proposal" (Volume I) and "Technical Proposal" (Volume II). <br />As follows:</p>
<p>Volume I- PRICE PRPOSAL - 3 Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume I) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in the Pricing Section of the Solicitation, and their proposed dollar amounts. The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred.</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractor's technical proposal.</p>
<p>Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions. Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Volume II - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL/ PLAN - Two (2) Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Technical Proposal (Volume II) shall be submitted in the following stated distinct tabs.</p>

<p>The offeror will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services. Prior experience beyond five (5) years will not be considered.

<p>TAB (C) - PLAN OF OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE- Tab "C" shall set forth the functions, responsibilities, qualifications, and authorities of the offeror's management personnel. The offeror shall provide a complete, clear, and concise organizational chart which delineates the role and responsibility of corporate management as it will pertain to the successful performance of the resulting contract.</p>

The Plan shall provide methods and procedures that will be utilized to accomplish all required services under the solicitation, and which will ensure that all start-up, training, and qualification requirements will be accomplished both before the commencement date for services and satisfactorily maintained during the term of the contract. The offeror shall provide details on how personnel will be brought on-site without interruption starting with the first day of the contract.</p>
<p>TAB (D) - PHASE IN/ OUT PLAN - The offeror shall submit a brief phase-in/ phase-out plan detailing the actions that will be taken to interface if there is a successor Contractor to ensure the continuation and continuity of all services without any interruption in the event the offeror is not awarded a follow on contract.</p>

<p>To be considered for award, the offeror's proposal must provide sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation by the DOS Evaluation Panel.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates awarding one (1) IDIQ contract under this RFP to the responsive and responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements of the solicitation and whose offer is considered to be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offeror.</p>

<p>Note: Award of this contract may be made based on the initial quotation/proposal and without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, <br />with the exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and <br />weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un- <br />acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable<br />representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated <br />as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull; OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the <br />Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,<br />the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.<br />&bull; GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in <br />achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, <br />sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some <br />weaknesses.<br />&bull; ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to<br />moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there <br />are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial <br />and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.<br />&bull; UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate<br />To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. <br />An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, <br />or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. <br />The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.<br />&bull; NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.<br />* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL<br />rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

Description - The Department of Heath and Human Services, HHS, is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services. One tool to communicate with the public and to educate HHS staff on policy and issues is through video. These video products are part of new and on-going messaging campaigns to the public and key stakeholders. The key stakeholders are but not limited to, senior HHS staff, Congress and media outlets. The HHS broadcast studio provides training, informational, and media outreach products to staff and the general public. Products include a variety of video programs such as, live satellite broadcasts and media tours, long format documentaries, public service announcements, and web-based media products. <br />In addition to producing video products there is a need for the daily staffing, production management, engineering and maintenance of the HHS studio. The active HHS studio requires daily operational staffing to support studio functions, editing requirements, field production, engineering, maintenance, as well as, other routine studio tasks.<br />HHS also requires video production and video engineering services during times of national health emergencies at the Continuity of Operations site(s). The types of personnel and services are to be determined at the time of need. Due to the nature of this need, the amount of preparation time and time at the site is impossible to establish.<br />HHS requires a comprehensive range of production services including such tasks as writing, producing, directing, on-camera talent, camera operating, graphics production, audio technicians, teleprompting, makeup, broadcast engineering, production coordination &amp; management, video editing and mastering. HHS may also require the rental of studio and field production equipment, as well as, the fabrication of sets and the acquisition of props. HHS productions generally fall into one of three categories: 1) live satellite broadcasts or web-casts from the HHS studio or remote locations, 2) ENG/EFP - sometimes in areas affected by disasters, 3) "film-style" shoots (with scripts, scenes, actors, locations, etc.). Production crewing services are required locally for sites across the continental US and internationally on short notice.</p>

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

804.1102	VERIFICATION OF STATUS OF APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR (OCT 2010) (DEVIATION)
 
(a)	The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at: www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:
 
(1)	The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service- disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov, internet site. This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.
 
(2)	Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3). Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and
 
(3)	Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4). Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day-to-day management and administration of business operations. Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day-to-day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.
 
(b)	CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO. The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.
 
(c)	If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.
 
(d)	This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.

ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (Feb 2011)

(a) To the extent that contract cost increases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the offeror warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases. 

(b)   Index - one index will be used for this order.   It is published at http://www.bls.gov/ppi/ by the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The index to be used is the Producer Price Index (PPI) for Commodity Code 012, Grains.

(c) Base and Replacement Indices, 

(1)  The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, is the Jan 2011 index for Grains (Commodity Code 012), published Feb 16, 2011 with a value of 227.1.

 
(2)  Prior to the exercise of an option year, when the new January 201X PPI is published, the percent change of grain will be calculated using the new PPI.  If the percent change between the Base Index and Replacement Index is less than or equal to 15% of the base amount, no adjustment will be made.  If the percent change is 15% greater than or less than the base amount, an adjustment will be made and the new PPI for Grain will become the new base index for future calculations.  This change greater than positive or negative 15% will hereinafter be called a "triggering event."

For example, if the new index for grain is 204.4 or 249.8, no adjustment will be made.  If the new index for grain is 193.0 or 261.2 and adjustment will be made and 193.0 or 261.2 would be used as a replacement base for all future adjustments, and the new PPI for Grains 012 will be used to calculate the new base prices, as described in paragraph (d), below.

(d)  Calculation of Adjusted Prices

(1) Laboratory Animal Food - The prices of all laboratory animal products will be adjusted based upon the grain contained therein.  No further adjustments will be made for any other ingredient.
 
Specifically, if a triggering event occurs, the price will be adjusted by the percent change from the prior year as calculated in the new PPI for Grains 012, i.e, increase (+) the price by the amount of a positive percent change or decrease (-) the price by the amount of a negative percent change as in the following formula:

 


If the percent change is unavailable, or if a calculation is needed for periods other than 12 months, the following formula shall be used:

 

(2) Non-Food Products - No price adjustments will be made for non-food products (e.g., beddings) 
 

 (e)  The contracting officer shall retain a copy of the Base Index in the contract file and prior to exercising each option year, shall obtain a copy of the PPI for Grain 012.  The Contracting Officer shall calculate an adjustment if a triggering event has occurred.  If a triggering event has occurred, the contracting officer shall, before the start of the following option year (if exercised) or within ten business days, whichever is later, issue a modification to the contract adjusting the unit prices, as specified in paragraph (d).  The adjusted unit or contract prices shall be effective for all order placed or services provided after the effective date of the exercised option as specified in this paragraph (3) until the next contract adjustment.  If the contracting officer fails to act, the contractor shall request a contract adjustment in writing and any subsequent adjustment shall be retroactive to the applicable date of contract adjustment specified in this paragraph (e).  The contactor's entitlement to price increases for a prior triggering event is waived unless the contractor's written request for an adjustment under this clause received by the contracting officer no later than 30 days following the effective date of the exercised option.  The Government's right to contract decreases for prior triggering events is waived unless the contracting officer processes a contract modification no later than 30 days after the effective date of the exercised option.  

(g)  Price adjustments pursuant to this clause, which shall be made by contract modification issued by the contracting officer, shall show the percent change from the PPI Grains 012  (or if no percent change was available, the calculation of the triggering event), the adjusted contract prices (see paragraph (d)), the mathematical calculations used to arrive at the adjusted contract prices, and the effective date of the adjustment (see paragraph (e)).

 (h)  In the event that Bureau of Labor Statistics discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the indices cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.  Should the parties fail to agree upon an appropriate substitute, the Contracting Officer may make a unilateral modification to substitute the index.  Any dispute of this unilateral modification shall be subject to the "Disputes" clause of this order.  If the contracting officer determines that the Index consistently and substantially fails to reflect market conditions, the contracting officer may modify the contract to specify the use of an appropriate substitute index. 

(i)  Any dispute arising under this clause shall be resolved in accordance with and subject to the "Disputes" clause of the order.
(End of Clause)

<DESC>The questions submitted concerning Solicitation number W911N2-11-R-0014 which includes the answers are the following:<br><br>Question 1 - Do you want the Status Monitor Box, Version 5.0 made out of Aluminum? Answer: The part number RHINO-5M-5001 is a Letterkenny part number.  It is on drawing revision C attached as a document to solicitation W911N2-11-R-0014.  This part is used on a system here at Letterkenny called RHINO.  It is noted on sheets 2, 3, 4 of the drawing that this piece is made from.  This piece is made of 5052 aluminum .09 thickness.<br><br>Question 2: Are you saying that 400 units/year is the minimum quantity that you would be obligated to purchase? Answer:  The Government has a known requirement right now of 400 each per year.  This is the quantity that Letterkenny's customer is willing to purchase each year. This is not to say that this quantity won't increased later, it just means that an increase in quantity above the 400 each cannot be guaranteed for this requirement. The minimum is 400 and the maximum is unknown.    <br><br>Question 3: Are there any marking requirements for each unit?  Answer:  If you are refering to shipping the units can be individually wrapped for protection purposes, but bulk shipping is fine.

Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
    Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) "Termination for cause." The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Jan 2011) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1)__Are,__are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3)__Are,__are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1)__In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2)__Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror__does__does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror__does__does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data to be accessed, and the type of information technology (IT) system access required. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause. The contractor shall: - Ensure that all non-U.S. citizen contractor employees are lawful permanent residents of the United States or have appropriate work authorization documents as required by the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Appeals, to work in the United States. - Ensure that no employees are assigned to High Risk designated positions prior to a completed preliminary screening. - Submit all required personnel security forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 24 hours of an assignment to a Department contract and ensure that the forms are complete. - Ensure that no contractor employee is placed in a higher risk position than that for which he or she was previously approved, without the approval of the Contracting Officer or his or her representative, the Department Personnel Security Officer, and the Computer Security Officer. - Ensure that all contractor employees occupying High Risk designated positions submit forms for reinvestigation every five (5) years for the duration of the contract or if there is a break in service to a Department contract of 365 days or more. - Report to the COR all instances of individuals seeking to obtain unauthorized access to any departmental IT system, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information. - Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment or access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information, promotes the efficiency of the service or violates the public trust. - Withdraw from consideration under the contract any employee receiving an unfavorable adjudication determination. - Officially notify each contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on a Department contract. - Abide by the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, "Contractor Employee Personnel Screenings."

<p>307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)<br />(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E).

In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest). <br />Offeror's Name ___________________________________________________ <br />RFP/Contract No. _________________________________________________ <br />Signature ________________________________________________________ <br />Title ____________________________________________________________ <br />Date ____________________________________________________________ <br /><br /><br />310-16 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)<br />The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract.

<p>314-1 PAST PERFORMANCE REPORT (MAR 1996)<br />Each offeror shall submit the following information as a separately bound part of its proposal for both the offeror and proposed major subcontractors. Major, regarding past performance, is any subcontractor that is subcontracted for a minimum of 25% of the total contract amount. Each major subcontractor shall identify the name of the prime contractor on each of its past performance forms. If the offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. <br />A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. If the offeror's last four similar contracts are all currently in process, submit the last three similar contracts currently in process, and the most recent similar contract completed within the last three years. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. Contracts with the parent or an affiliate of the offeror may not be used. Include the following information for each contract and subcontract: 1. Identification a. Name of the contracting activity b. Program title or product name c. Contract number d. Contract type e. Period of performance, including all option periods f. Contract Value: (1) Initial projected total contract amount including all option periods (2) Final or current projected total contract amount including all option periods g. Points of Contact (1) Contracting officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (2) Administrative contracting officer, if different from above, and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (3) Program manager, COTR or technical officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) 2.

Brief, specific examples of the offeror's high quality performance 3. If any of the listed contracts are award-fee or incentive contracts, include a table showing fees awarded and the minimum and maximum available fee for each period. 4. Paragraph E. below requires you to send a copy of the "Contractor Information Form" to each of your references. In your past performance report, include: a. The date you sent the "Contractor Information Form" to each reference. b. How you sent it (e.g., fax, mail, express delivery service, courier, e-mail, etc.). c. To whom you sent it including telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known). <br />B. The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in A above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Other than the information requested in A above, offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references. <br />C. Offerors should understand the difference between experience and past performance. Experience reflects the offeror's capability of performing a requirement. Past performance reflects how well it has performed similar requirements. In assessing past performance, the quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. <br />D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications(e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify which segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Information about awards will be considered in evaluation of each of the past performance subfactors described in "Evaluation Criteria." The offeror may describe how the award relates to one or more of the subfactors. <br />E. No later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation, send a copy to each of your four references of the "Contractor Performance Information" form attached to this solicitation. Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. <br />F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Past Performance" form identified in Attachment D will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br />311-6 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (APRIL 1998)<br />Offerors must submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist. Questions may be submitted via E-Mail, fax or regular mail to: Jessalyn Mastrianni, Jessalyn.Mastrianni@ed.gov with a concurrent copy to Desandre.Woodard@ed.gov.

<CONTACT>Gregory E Laws, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-227-7173, Fax 301-227-1461, Email Gregory.E.Laws@nga.mil
<DESC><p>This solicitation is extended until March 30 2011. Below are questions and answers from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Q. 1. Attachment 4.1, paragraph 3.1.11 refers to a "reasonably thorough security screening" of instructors. Is NAC/LAC screening required?</p>
<p>A. A NAC/LAC is not required; however, because the courses are conducted in NGA facilities, we would appreciate instructors who are not involved with organizations considered questionable by the US Government. In the past, we have had to dismiss instructors who displayed erratic behavior, asking probing questions about the student's work, etc. This creates problems in getting another instructor when the courses are only one week long. Should this occur, we would expect a prompt replacement to ensure minimal disruption to the course or reimbursement for the remaining portion of the course.</p>
<p>Q. 2. Attachment 4.1, paragraph 3.3.1 refers to standard classroom instruction. Will NGA facilities be equipped with Smart Boards? Will Advanced Distributed Learning capabilities be required?</p>
<p>NGA does not have Smart boards and we do not require advanced distributed learning capabilities at this time.</p>
<p>Q. 3. Attachment 4.1, paragraph 3.3.2 indicates that readings should be available via the web. Does NGA provide a portal or is the vendor expected to provide a portal?</p>
<p>A. Websites should be accessible to the students from any internet connection (unclassified system at NGA or at the student's home, a library, or other location providing computer access with internet to individuals). We would like to know the websites in advance so that we can let our students know which sites they may access from the workplace and which ones may be prohibited to access from our location.</p>
<p>Q. 4. Can you provide insight into the other possible locations and language instruction requirements.</p>
<p>A. NGA routinely conducts courses at our facilities in St. Louis and the Washington DC area (Springfield, VA primarily). On rare occasion, we may request a course be held in another location in the CONUS.</p>
<p>Q. 5. Will travel be allowable for unusual, non-standard CONUS locations?</p>
<p>A. We do not have funding to cover travel costs and rarely conduct classes outside of our St. Louis and Washington DC area facilities. Other vendors in the past were able to acquire local instructors to prevent any travel costs.</p>
<p>Q 6. How many hours is each class?</p>
<p>A. (The NGA LASTRA courses are 7 hours a day for 5 days, for a total of 35 hours of instruction per class).</p>
<p>Q. 7. I see on page 4 of the Solicitation Order (4 of 29) where it states invoice protocol. But, I do not see where it is written in the Solicitation how you pay or when you pay? Can the vendor expect payment by p-card within 5 days of completion of each class? Please advise.</p>
<p>A. invoices will submitted to, and Payment will be made by NGA payment office once a month.</p>
<p>Q. 8. What happens if materials were purchased for a class that is later cancelled? Will the materials be paid for promptly even if the class does not take place for 6 weeks?</p>
<p>A. If materials are delivered and accepted the vendor should submit the invoices to the NGA payment office for payment of supplies. the supplies will be used for the rescheduled class.</p>
<p>Q. 9. Attachment 4.3 discusses guidelines and items required for proper proposal submission. My question is in regards to Attachment 4.4. Are bidders required to check the appropriate boxes and submit that Attachment 4.4 with their bid? Are there any other required documents that must be submitted other than what is specifically listed in Attachment 4.3?</p>
<p>A. Vendors have to be registered into the CCR/ORCA data bases. If vendors are registered into the CCR/ORCA data base submit a copy of their Reps and Certs with their proposal. If vendors are not registered into the ORCA data base attachment 4.4 need to be filled out and submitted with their proposal.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>The Offeror shall follow the format and instructions below in preparing its proposal.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To facilitate proposal evaluation, the offeror shall submit three (3) copies of their Price Proposal as Volume I and three (3) copies of their Technical proposal as Volume II. These volumes must be clearly marked as "Price Proposal" (Volume I) and "Technical Proposal" (Volume II). <br />As follows:</p>
<p>Volume I- PRICE PRPOSAL - Three (3) Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume I) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in the Pricing Section of the Solicitation, and their proposed dollar amounts. The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred.</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractor's technical proposal.</p>
<p>Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions. Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Volume II - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL/ PLAN - Three (3) Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Technical Proposal (Volume II) shall be submitted in the following stated distinct tabs.</p>

<p>TAB (D) - PHASE IN/ OUT PLAN - The offeror shall submit a brief phase-in/ phase-out plan detailing the actions that will be taken to interface if there is a successor Contractor to ensure the continuation and continuity of all services without any interruption in the event the offeror is not awarded a follow on contract.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award.

<p>Note: Award of this contract may be made based on the initial quotation/proposal and without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, <br />with the exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and <br />weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un- <br />acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable<br />representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated <br />as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull; OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the <br />Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,<br />the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.<br />&bull; GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in <br />achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, <br />sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some <br />weaknesses.<br />&bull; ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to<br />moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there <br />are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial <br />and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.<br />&bull; UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate<br />To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. <br />An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, <br />or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. <br />The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.<br />&bull; NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.<br />* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL<br />rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Please note, the following clarifications have been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:
<p><br />Q1: "There is an installation firm that would be suitable for the complete engineering and construction of the project. However, we would like to engage this firm as a subcontractor for the Technical Assistance. If they acted as a subconsultant to the successful Offeror and completed the preliminary design per Task 6, would this disqualify them from responding to the RFP developed in Task 12 for the 5 MW pilot plant?"</p>
<p>A1: Yes, participation in the pre-project technical assistance study by a subcontractor/subconsultant would disqualify them - as well as their parent company, if applicable - from implementation of the solar photovoltaic power plant, per Moroccan procurement law.</p>
<p>Q2: "Work on Task 5 is contingent on Grantee accepting the Task 4 report. How much review time should we assume for the scheduling task 5?"</p>
<p>A2: A timeframe has not been set. The successful Offeror can negotiate a timeframe with Grantee as required.</p>
<p>Q3: "We propose to develop technical specifications for the RFP. We recommend the commercial terms should be by the Grantee and two volumes - Commercial and Technical constitute a proposed RFP. Please provide your comment on this approach."</p>
<p>A3: It is up to the Offeror to respond to the RFP in the manner in which they believe best meets the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Q4: "Is the energy storage technology to be included in TA? What criteria to be used for technology selection for PV and for storage system?"</p>
<p>A4: Task 4 of the TOR does include an analysis of energy storage. Some example criteria are given in Task 4.</p>

<p>Morocco has limited indigenous fossil fuel resources and consequently relies on imports, particularly coal and oil, to meet more than 97% of the country's energy needs. This reliance makes Morocco vulnerable to volatile changes in the price of oil, natural gas and other forms of energy. In 2008, the country expended over $8 billion to meet its energy needs through imports, with additional government subsidies totaling $1.5 billion to regulate consumer prices of these petroleum products. At the same time, energy demand is rising by approximately 7% per year while capacity is growing at only half that rate.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Government of Morocco (GOM) has recognized the vital need to develop long-term, sustainable sources of energy by exploiting the country's vast indigenous, renewable energy resources. The GOM has launched a national renewable energy and energy efficiency plan that aims to achieve installed generation capacity of 2 GW each from solar, wind and hydro resources by 2020; representing a potential renewable energy input of 42% of total energy capacity. The GOM is highly committed to the development of renewable sources of energy and is moving to implement several projects and initiatives.</p>
<p>This ambitious program is supported by several regulatory and financial initiatives, and by the recent creation of public sector entities, such as ADEERE. ADEERE was established in January 2010 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment. ADEERE's mission is to oversee small-scale renewable energy projects and pilot programs; conduct research of the development of renewable energy; and coordinate project implementation with other sector stakeholders to support long-term sustainable development of Morocco's energy policies.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance will support ADEERE's objectives through providing a detailed assessment for the implementation of a 5 MW solar PV pilot power plant in Essaouira. The pilot project is expected to showcase the applicability of solar PV technology on a utility scale and will serve as a model for duplication throughout Morocco in similar sized cities with limited grid access. The Technical Assistance will identify the specific needs of a solar PV power facility including preferred and alternative site evaluation; technological and financial assessments; engineering; permitting analysis, and project implementation planning.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $631,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, April 8, 2011 at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Reference is made to the February 18, 2011 announcement, reference number 2010- 21010A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Morocco: Essaouira Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant Technical Assistance.
<p><br />The following clarifications have been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:</p>
<p><br />1. Q: "It is not clear from the description of Task 1 who will provide site specific solar resource data, i.e. direct normal insolation (DNI) and diffuse radiation data on hourly basis. Are ambient conditions, i.e. temperature, pressure, and relative humidity data available? What is the source for the data?"<br />A: ADEREE has global solar radiation and temperature of the region of Essaouira. However, as mentioned in the annex of the TOR, the contractor should work with the National Meteorology Department to get other data: pressure, relative humidity, direct and diffuse radiation data on hourly basis. Otherwise, the contractor should use simulation software if hourly data are not available (mainly the DNI).</p>
<p>2. Q: "Does the National Meteorology Department (DMN) have solar insolation data for a typical year? Will this resource be adequate to estimate performance of PV systems?"<br />A: The National Meteorology Department (DMN) has simulated (not measured) solar insolation data for a typical year for the region of Essaouira. This data should be adequate to estimate performance of PV systems, but DNI data should be necessary to estimate performance of other PV systems (Task 4).</p>
<p>3. Q: "Will ONE provide the basis to develop electricity consumption, generation and demand projections? Does ONE have their internal load growth and new generation projections available for review?"<br />A: ADEREE, within Task 1, should conduct [this work] with the contractor, meeting with ONE to get electricity consumption, generation and demand projections. ONE have their internal load growth and could give to the contractor their new generation projections for review.</p>
<p>4. Q: "Are there sites that have been flagged as potential sites or will the Contractor need to choose all of the potential sites?"<br />A: There are no sites that have been flagged as potential sites so far. The Contractor, with the help of ADEREE, ONE and local authorities, should find out and choose one of the potential sites.</p>
<p>5. Q: "In Section 4 [of the RFP] a mechanical engineer is listed as a member of key staff. We feel that a civil engineer would be a more useful key staff member. May we include a civil engineer instead of a mechanical engineer without harming our evaluation rating?"<br />A: We [ADEREE] agree that a civil engineer would be a more useful key staff member than mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>6. Q: "In the deliverable for Task 5, what is meant by application requirements?"<br />A: It means that the contractor should verify that all the requirements, technical tools, equipment and or workforce necessary to carry out installation, operation and maintenance activities are locally available regarding site location and area characteristics.</p>
<p>7. Q: "In Task 6, it is noted that the design/specifications should include "systems utility balance." Can you clarify what is being requested?"<br />A: It means an estimation of the PV energy cover rate of energy regarding electricity demand at the preferred site</p>
<p>8. Q: "In Task 6, it is noted that the design/specifications should include "system performance and specifications." Can you clarify what is being requested?"<br />A: Essentially the estimation of the energy output and performance during the year (simulation for 12 months) regarding climatic data and energy balance with the national/local grid or local electricity consumption.</p>
<p>9. Q: "The RFP notes that a statement confirming the availability of the proposed project manager and key staff over the duration of the project must be included. Is it sufficient to note in the text of the proposal that all staff and the manager will be available? Or is a separate letter from the Offeror and all subcontractors affirming availability required?"<br />A: A separate, brief letter confirming availability from each proposed team member is required.</p>
<p>10. Q: "Section 3.5 of the proposal reads "as many as possible but not more than six relevant and verifiable project references..." Is this accurate or should it read &lsquo;less than six'"?<br />A: This is accurate. Six project references should be included if possible, or as many as possible up to six (but not more).</p>
<p>11. Q: "Task 2 notes that the Contractor is to assess the availability and/or suitability for access roads to all parts of the site. By this, are you noting that the Contractor should consider whether it is possible and appropriate to install access roads on the footprint of the solar project? Roads leading to the project? Something else?"<br />A: The Contractor must assess whether access roads exist and are available for use both to and within the proposed site(s).</p>
<p>12. Q: "Task 5 notes that "the design criteria documents shall apply to the Pilot Project, and shall be adaptable as model documents for future plants." For clarification, this means that the documents should be specific to the Pilot Project but written in such a way that they can be tweaked and used for other projects?"<br />A: Yes, this Pilot Project is intended to be replicable. The design documents should therefore be specific to the Pilot Project but adaptable for use at different sites.</p>
<p>13. Q: "The deliverable for Task 5 notes that the design specifications and operation and maintenance procedures should be based on permitting and regulatory requirements. There may be specifications and procedures that go beyond these requirements. Should such specifications and procedures be included, as well?"<br />A: Where possible, the design specifications and operation and maintenance procedures should be as complete as possible, so additional specifications and procedures may be included.</p>
<p>14. Q: "Task 6 lists both &lsquo;major equipment list' and &lsquo;instrument index.' Can you describe how these differ?"<br />A: The major equipment list will contain specific information such as sizing, whereas the instrument index will simply list what was included in the deliverable for this Task.</p>
<p>15. Q: "Task 9 notes that the Contractor will assess mechanisms to enable private sector participation. Could you clarify whether you are referring to participation in the Pilot Project or in the Moroccan solar industry?<br />A: This Task refers to private sector participation in the Moroccan solar industry.<br /><br />16. Q: "In Task 12 the Contractor is asked to develop an RFP for the installation of the pilot project. Has the financing mechanism under which the pilot project will be installed been determined? For example, the project could be built under a BOT (build, operate and transfer) scheme, a BOO (build, own, operate) scheme, a BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer) scheme, or some other financial structure. If the mechanism has not been determined, do you want the Contractor to suggest a mechanism?"<br />A: The financing structure has not been determined and the contractor will prepare a recommendation for the Grantee (Task 9).</p>
<p>17. Q: "In Task 12 there is a bulleted list of items for inclusion in the RFP. Is this information that you would like the RFP to specify, that you would like RFP to ask the bidder to provide, or a mixture of the two?"<br />A: The bulleted points are meant to be areas that a prospective bidder will need to respond to in order to successfully compete for implementation of this Pilot Project.</p>
<p>18. Q: "Do you know if the construction contractor will or has to be a Morocco based entity?"<br />A: Per USTDA Nationality Requirements (Annex III of the RFP), the contractor for this technical assistance project must be a U.S. company. However, they are permitted to subcontract up to 20% of the value of this grant to local (i.e. Moroccan) firms. It is up to the Offeror to decide who and how they would like to propose as their contracting team.</p>
<p>19. Q: "Has a contractor has been selected?"<br />A: A contractor has not been selected, either for the present technical assistance activity or the implementation phase of the proejct. Based on the proposals received through this RFP process, the project sponsor will select the best qualified Offeror to conduct this technical assistance activity.</p>
<p>20. Q: "Can you confirm what percent of the $631,000 grant by the USTDA will be of the total consulting costs or estimated?"<br />A: This grant is a fixed-price grant. It is up to the Offeror to determine if the sum is sufficient for their purposes to perform the technical assistance project.</p>
<p>21. Q: "What is the best form to send the final copy? In other words - is UPS or FedEx reliable?"<br />A: USTDA makes no recommendation on a particular carrier. However, it is recommended to allow at least one week for delivery to the indicated address.<br /><br />22. Q: "What is the typical delivery timeline for an overnight courier?"<br />A: The Offeror will need to determine this answer through their selected courier.</p>
<p>N.B. A few questions are outstanding and will be answered in a subsequent RFP amendment.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Questions and Answers:<br /><br />Q: Reference PWS 3.1.1., "USAF Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) shall approve any overtime request in writing, prior to any overtime work being performed as referenced in paragraph 3.2.2." Since labor is a firm-fixed price item, what level of overtime support (labor hours, weeks, etc.) does the Government want the contractor to price? Or instead, is it the Government's intention to modify the contract for each instance where overtime support is required?</p>
<p>A: Government estimates that overtime is rare. If any overtime support is required outside of the PPP a modification shall be required along with QAP approval.</p>
<p>Q: Reference PWS 3.8.1, "the contractor shall, when required and approved by the QAP, travel to user's location to provide on-site technical assistance for technical issues, and/or trouble shooting of problems encountered. These services can be in deployed locations in conjunction with user exercises or real world contingencies." Since labor is a firm-fixed price, what level of overseas support (labor hours, weeks, etc.) does the Government want the contractor to price overseas support? Or instead, is it the Government's intention to modify the contract for every instance where labor support to deployed locations is required?</p>
<p>A: Same as above. Government estimates that deployments and travel are rare. Travel is cost reimbursable. Government will mod the contract on TRAVEL CLIN if the need arises during the contract.<br /><br />Q: On the spares portion of the TEP workbook, request additional information for the line items listed.<br /><br />Line S535 - N/A Electronics Case A2 - Do you require a fully load A2 case, or an A2 Electronic case fully harness with the rear panels, but no LRU's? Please advise.</p>
<p>A: The part number for the Electronics Case A2 is 5-B78632-1. The Government will update TEP in amendment 07 of the RFP.</p>
<p>Line S536 - N/A HPA Mounting Hardware - Please be more specific regarding the hardware. Which pieces of hardware do you require? Screws? Handles?</p>
<p>A: The Government will update TEP to say "RESERVED" in amendment 07 of the RFP. It is simple hardware.</p>
<p>Line S538 - Replacement Roll Pin for Transit Case - The information that we have received from L3 Narda indicates that they do not sell this item. Please advise.</p>
<p>A: The Government will update TEP to say "RESERVED" in amendment 07 of the RFP. It is simple generic Pin.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to extend services. This action will result in a modification to the current contract, F04684-03-C-0050 with InDyne, Inc., 11800 Sunrise Valley Dr, Ste 250, Reston, VA for a period of twenty-four (24) months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 Oct 2011 through 30 Sep 2013. This extension is needed to satisfy the WROCI requirement until the award of the Launch &amp; Test Range Systems Integrated Support Contract (LISC), solicitation #09-49, can be completed. The LISC combines three current contracts: WROCI, Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) and Space Lift Range Systems (SLRS). The WROCI contract provides Western Range operations and maintenance; support services; training; command, control, communications, information and computer systems services; testing, modifying and installing communications, electronic and security systems at launch facilities, launch control centers test facilities and all 14 AF alarmed facilities located in Bldgs 10577 and 8401. This effort provides network equipment and software maintenance, and direct customer support for user access to, and information transfer, over the Non-Classified internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Local Area Network (LAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR) and launch agencies by providing qualified personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, specialized test equipment, supervision, and other items and services as necessary. The WROCI requires an innovative, integrated, flexible and effective management approach and the contractor must provide technical support in a planned and coordinated manner which will ensure essential Western Range support systems are ready to support user requirements, and cause no impact to Range program schedules due to equipment degradation, failures, system problems or reprioritization of program requirements. The wide variety of support systems involves careful workload planning and scheduling of resources to identify and resolve technical systems problems. The contractor will be required to maintain and operate Department of Defense (DoD) computers, radios, communication centers, voice and data switching, and common-user telephone systems, interface with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and assess the impact of integrating new Communication systems into the WR and base-wide infrastructure. The contractor will be required to operate the Network Control Center (NCC) and perform site observation, security services, operate sensitive unclassified destruct facility, and escort and data courier services as defined in this statement of work. The WR encompasses a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean. Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites. Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements. The WR receives and provides Range support to and from various agencies, to include but not limited to, the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45th Space Wing (45 SW), 452nd Flight Test Squadron (452nd FTS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), and Reagan Test Site (RTS). The 30 SW is responsible for providing Range capability to conduct and support activities for spacelift, ballistic missile, and aeronautical programs. The WR is part of the Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports DoD, NASA, commercial, and other user launch, orbital tracking, and test programs. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) operations described above. This twenty-four month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements&rdquo; as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This extension of services will extend the end date of the period of performance from 30 Sep 2011 to 30 Sep 2013. This extension of services will further allow for the future competitive procurement for these services under the LISC to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. InDyne, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for extension of these services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services.&rdquo; The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Shirley Castillo at shirley.castillo@vandenberg.af.mil and Claudia Boga at claudia.boga@vandenberg.af.mil.

<DESC>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Fort Belvoir, VA is conducting a market survey to locate potential manufacturers or suppliers of a Parachute Navigation System (PARANAVSYS) for use during Military Freefall (MFF) operations.  PARANAVSYS is a multipurpose navigation device designed for Military Free Fall (MFF) operations use pre-jump in aircraft, during infiltration and on-ground follow-on missions, and will allow for enhanced mission planning and improved MFF parachutist infiltration capabilities.  The PARANAVSYS will consist of a Navigation Unit, mounting hardware and a GPS Retransmission Kit (GPS RTK).  A description of each component is as follows:<br>       <br>Navigation Unit.  The Navigation Unit serves as the centerpiece of the PARANAVSYS and will consist of a portable ruggedized computer hardware platform capable of receiving GPS signals and supporting both navigation and mission planning software required to meet program requirements.  The Navigation Unit will meet all performance parameters and system attributes as specified herein.  The Navigation Unit will be man wearable (chest, wrist or otherwise mounted to the parachutist, ruck sack stowable, etc) and consist of a ruggedized computer platform with a display that will be directly readable by the user.  Systems may also include a remote display to allow the main computing platform to be stowed in a ruck sack or elsewhere on the parachutist.  The Navigation Unit will acquire and process GPS data, control the display, and communicate via a wireless or hardwired data link to a separate mission planning laptop computer as required, or if capable, each unit may also concurrently serve as a mission planner.  The electronics package of the Navigation Unit will be comprised of a micro controller, memory, battery, control switches, GPS receiver/antenna, external PC interface port, wireless receiver/transmitter, and display interface electronics.<br>    <br>Mounting Hardware.  Mounting hardware will be required to secure the Navigation Unit firmly to the jumper during MFF operations.  Mounting hardware will interface directly with the MOLLE vest and a support belt for chest mounted systems or by other secure means for other systems. Mounting hardware will not interfere in any way with standard MFF equipment, or the parachutist's ability to operate their canopy or any other standard MFF equipment.<br><br>GPS Retransmission Kit (GPS RTK).  A GPS RTK will be required to provide a GPS signal onboard all training and operational aircraft to take full advantage of the capabilities of the PARANAVSYS during MFF High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) operations.  GPS availability prior to exit allows the jumpmaster to identify a pre-planned release point based on target information and weather data entered during the mission planning phase. GPS rebroadcast onboard the aircraft will also allow the system to reacquire satellites from a "warm start" with a pre-acquired almanac as opposed to a "cold start" with an empty almanac. <br>       <br>Additionally, the PARANAVSYS shall have the following capabilities:<br><br>(Threshold (T) = Objective (O) unless otherwise specified)<br><br>1. Network Ready.  PARANAVSYS shall be Network Ready per CJCSI 6212.01E, 15 Dec 08, and USA TRADOC CPD Writing Guide, dated 16 Jun 09, IER Matrix/IT/NSS/GIG<br><br>Rationale:  PARANAVSYS must properly interface with joint and service enterprise systems comprising the Global Information Grid.<br><br>2. System GPS Accuracy.   The PARANAVSYS must provide guidance for jumpers to successfully deploy to a designated target.  Using system GPS guidance alone, jumpers must reach a pre-designated drop zone and verify that the system can successfully locate the impact point within 100 ft (T), and verify that the system can successfully locate the impact point within 50 ft (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Accuracy requirements less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.<br><br>3. System Reliability.  The system must provide a 95 percent probability of achieving a successful mission.  A successful mission will be free from the occurrence of a system abort (SA) for a period of 3 hours (T) 6 hours (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Operators are required to conduct mission planning throughout a 96 hour timeframe and the system may be required to be in use for up to a 3 hour or more uninterrupted use during operation within that 96 hour period.  System reliability less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.  The definition of a SA will be defined in the failure Definition and Scoring Criteria (FD&SC).<br> 	<br>4. Operational Environmental Parameters.  <br><br>a. Altitude.  Must operate at an altitude of up to 24,999 feet (MSL) (T) and 35,000 feet MSL (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The ability to achieve repeated on-ground accuracy, when aerially released from altitudes beyond the range of most threat weaponry, is the essence of a precision airdrop capability.  High altitude release increases air carrier, aircrew and jumper survivability.  <br><br>b. Minimum and Maximum Temperature.  Operate at a steady temperature of 40 F with a sudden drop to -30 F.  Hold at -30 F for 2 minutes followed by a gradual temperature increase of 2 F/minute for 40 minutes (T), Provide operation at a steady temperature of 40 F with a sudden drop to -65 F. Hold at -65 F for 2 minutes followed by a sudden temperature increase of 35 F in 75 seconds then a gradual temperature increase of 2 F/minute for 40 minutes (O).<br><br>Rationale:  These temperature profiles model worst case exposure times for an exit from 24,999 ft MSL (T) and 35,000 ft MSL (O) based on the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere Temperature Profile.  Temperature variations at altitude and on the DZ can vary greatly and put a high degree of stress on both the individual and equipment. <br><br>c. Mechanical Shock:  Unit to withstand 7g's shock with all accompanying attachments and remain functional (T).  Unit to withstand 10g's and dropped from 36 inches onto concrete and remain functional (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The system will need to withstand any shock that is anticipated during an airborne operation.  This includes any and all harness and restraint attachments required for system mounting.<br><br>d. Light Conditions.  The system shall work in day or night light conditions.<br><br>Rationale:  The system will not be limited to visual light conditions and will facilitate safe and effective use, as unit is required to be used during any and all conditions that the system will be doctrinally and operationally allowed.<br>5. System Storage Environmental Parameters.  Minimum and Maximum Temperature in accordance with MIL STD 810-E.<br><br>Rationale:  The system will be stored in a wide variety of temperatures and requires a minimum and maximum parameter in accordance with MIL STD 810-E.<br><br>6. System Laptop Connection.  Laptop connection must be hardwired and wireless.<br><br>Rationale:  The system must have a hardwired and wireless capability as both a threshold and objective.  The contingency if the wireless fails will be hardwired.<br><br>7. System GPS Type.  GPS type must be Commercial GPS (training mode), Military SAASM via attachable DAGR (operational) external to the system (T) and Military SAASM (internal to the system) (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Systems will have internal commercial GPS.  A SAASM GPS capability may be provided via an attachable DAGR radio as a threshold.  Internal Military SAASM GPS without a DAGR attachment is an objective.<br><br>8. System User Operated Buttons.  <br><br>a. Power.  Manual power (on/off) control is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required for simplicity and muscle memory.    <br><br>b. Landing Zone.  User selectable Landing Zone option is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required for switching from one screen to another.  <br><br>c. Brightness.  Brightness adjustment is user-controlled (T), automatically adjusts based on ambient light (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required to vary the brightness on the system display.  Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light without user control is an objective.<br><br>d. Multi-Display Page.  Multi-Display Page user operated buttons are required to utilize and toggle between the other existing display screens.<br><br>Rationale:  One switch is required for simplicity and muscle memory.<br><br>e. SAASM GPS Zeroization.  SAASM GPS Zeroization shall be one hand multi-key zeroization.<br><br>Rationale:  SAASM GPS zeroization erases all data from memory for security purposes.  Because of the result of this function, it must be difficult to perform to ensure the operation is intentional and not accidental.  A required simultaneous three key activation will help to ensure that this is only intentional.<br>            <br>9. System Display Pages.<br><br>a. Navigational Page.  Navigation display page(s) are required (T). Standard and sharable geospatial data (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Display pages assist the jumper to properly navigate to the appropriate drop zone.  All new systems require geospatial information as required by ASA (ALT) as of 21 Dec 2007.<br><br>b. Jump Master Page.  Jump master display page(s) are required.<br><br>Rationale:  The jump master display will be accessible to all jumpers and will greatly enhance the JM in correctly identifying the release point.  It will also give real-time situational awareness in the aircraft prior to executing an airborne operation.<br><br>c. Mission Planning Page.  Mission planning software and display page(s) are required.<br><br>Rationale:  Mission planning software and display on all systems allows for redundancy in mission planning and system commonality for training.<br><br>d. Deconfliction Page.  Jumper and Cargo Bundle Deconfliction/Collision Avoidance display page(s) are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This technology and accompanying human factors considerations such as information over load are not yet mature enough to incorporate into the system.  This capability will include the ability to track other jumpers' locations, both altitude and azimuth, and provide a warning if a mid-air collision is imminent.  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available.<br><br>e. Topographic Page.  Topographic display page(s) are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This technology is not yet thought to be mature enough to incorporate into the system.  This capability will include different topographical displays to aid jumper orientation.  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available.<br>                     <br>f. Moving Maps.  Moving maps are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available. This will include AGE compliant map data including Raster product Format types, Common Imagery Baseline, Compressed Arc Digitized Raster Graphic, Vector format types, Vector Product Format and shapefile.<br><br>g. Geospatial Data.  Geospatial Information Officer approved Geospatial Data is required.<br><br>Rationale:  All new systems require geospatial information as required by ASA (ALT) as of 21 Dec 2007.   <br>             <br>10. System Optical Parameters.<br><br>a. Focus.  Focus will be fixed (T) and adjustable (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Optical focus will be fixed as a threshold and adjustable as an objective.  The objective capability will greatly enhance the optical interface by allowing a user to adjust focus to meet individual preference. <br><br>b. Alignment.  Alignment will be fixed (T) and adjustable (O).<br>Rationale:  Optical alignment will be fixed as a threshold and adjustable as an objective.  The objective capability will greatly enhance the optical interface by allowing a user to adjust alignment to meet individual preference.<br><br>11. System Navigation Units. <br><br>a. Speed.  Speed will be displayed as knots (T) and miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and knots (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the choices needed in case different modes of speed are needed.<br><br>b. Direction.  Direction will be displayed as whole degrees.<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the ability to track his or her direction in whole degrees.<br><br>c. Distance.  Distance will be displayed as kilometers (T) and miles (statute), kilometers, and nautical miles (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the choices needed in case different modes of distance are required.<br><br>d. Altitude.  Altitude will be displayed as feet (T) and feet and meters (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the options in case different modes of altitude are required. <br><br>12. Satellite Acquisition Parameters.<br><br>a. GPS Lock.  GPS lock required within 10 min of cold start provided a continuous GPS signal with no physical or environmental obstacles preventing satellite reception (T).  GPS lock required within 20 seconds of warm start provided a continuous GPS signal with no physical or environmental obstacles preventing satellite reception (O).<br><br>Rationale:  GPS lock must be acquired quickly in order for the system to perform as needed.  A warm start refers to a system start in which the GPS almanac has already been acquired.  This allows for quick GPS lock reacquisition and is distinct from a "cold start" in which the almanac has not been acquired and may take much longer for GPS lock to be acquired given current technology.<br><br>b. Speed.  Speed will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br><br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.   <br><br>c. Direction.  Direction will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br><br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.<br><br>d. Distance.  Distance will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.<br><br>e. Altitude.  Altitude will be determined by GPS elevation data (T) and a barometric altimeter (O).<br><br>Rationale: GPS elevation data will be displayed as part of the Navigation and Jumpmaster pages.  While reliable this information can occasionally be inconsistent with pressure altitude; as an objective it is desired to include a barometric altimeter as part of the system which is available on COTS/NDI GPS receivers.<br><br>13. System Battery Parameters.<br><br>a. Duration.  Battery duration will be 3 hours (T) and >6 hours (O).  <br><br>Rationale:  The typical airborne operation is time consuming.  Systems will be required to perform for at least 3 hours, but optimally, greater than 6 hours with the option of using multiple soldier power sources to supplement for follow-on use.  To enable this, the unit will have a jack to accept a 12V DC power source. <br><br>b. Rechargeable.  Battery will be rechargeable and removable.<br><br>Rationale:  Battery to be rechargeable for economy and be removable for replacement.<br><br>c. Warning.  Low battery warning is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Low battery warning is essential for mission success.<br><br>d. Hot Swappable.  Battery will have 'hot swappable' capability to enable batteries to be swapped without loss of power (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The "hot swappable" capability will allow depleted batteries to be replaced with fully charged ones without the loss of any mission critical data such as the GPS almanac.<br><br>14. System Size.  The system will be as small and sleek as possible and fit into a protective case equal to or less than 8 inches wide, 3 inches deep and 7 inches in height.  <br><br>Rationale:  Size is always a consideration and prevention of line snags is critical.  Restriction to the given size envelope is needed to mitigate the risk of equipment interference.<br><br>15. System Weight.  System weight will be equal to or less than 5 lbs (T), 2.5 lbs (O). <br><br>Rationale:  Weight is an important consideration and should be kept to a minimum.  Higher weight would be a hindrance to the jumper and possibly degrade the success of the airborne operations.<br><br>16. System Data Refresh/Update Rate.<br><br>a. System.  System refresh/update rate of one (1) Hertz required.<br><br>Rationale:  The one (1) hertz speed is recommended as it will adequately refresh and update the system.<br><br>b. GPS Receiver.  GPS receiver able to log data points at a rate of at least one (1) per second.<br><br>Rationale:  The one (1) hertz speed is recommended in order to record and post data in real time while in freefall and under canopy. <br><br>17. Helmet Interface.  System must interface with Standard Military Gentex Parachutist, Gentex PM HALO, Commercial Pro-Tec, ACH (T) and Standard Military Gentex Parachutist, Gentex PM HALO, Commercial Pro-Tec & any Improved Ballistic Helmet Design (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will allow the jumper to use the system with any helmet they are issued.<br><br>18. Goggle Interface.  System must interface and attach to all goggles currently used for MFF operations (T) and Standard Gentex Parachutist Goggle, Gentex Wind Blast Face Shield, Custom Design Goggle with integrated display, compatible with night vision devices (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will allow the jumper to use with any set of goggles they are issued.  As an objective it is desired that the system interface with night vision devices to realize the full capability of the PARANAVSYS for night time operations. <br><br>19. Maintainability.  The system will have maintainability of not more than 72 hours Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). <br><br>Rationale:  This will allow commanders to maintain operational capability, minimizing down time for maintenance.<br><br>20. Display Connection to the Navigation Unit computer.  The system display will be hardwired to the Navigation Unit computer (T), connected via wireless communication (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Current COTS technology requires a hardwired connection to the Navigation Unit computer for utilizing the display capability.  A wireless connection is preferred as a P3I objective requirement in order to minimize the risk of equipment interference.<br><br>21. GPS Retransmission Kit.  The system will include a GPS Retransmission Kit (RTK) to rebroadcast GPS signal onboard the operational aircraft prior to personnel exit.  The GPS retransmission kit will have the following performance characteristics:<br><br>a. L1/L2 Signals.  The GPS RTK shall be able to receive and rebroadcast both L1 and L2 GPS signals with no interference to the aircraft.<br><br>Rationale: GPS signal must be available onboard all training and operational aircraft to take full advantage of the capabilities of the PARANAVSYS.  GPS availability prior to exit will allow the jumpmaster to use the jumpmaster display screen for release point identification.  GPS rebroadcast onboard the aircraft will also allow the system to reacquire satellites from a "warm start" with a pre-acquired almanac as opposed to a "cold start" with an empty almanac which may take much longer. <br><br>The GPS RTK shall rebroadcast both commercial and military GPS signals in the bands 1575.42 +/- 12 MHz (L1) and 1227.6 +/- 12MHz (L2).  The RTK shall be designed to ensure that all efforts are taken to mitigate the rebroadcast of all signals outside of these bands.  Any such emissions must be attenuated to a negligible level so that the GPS RTK will not interfere with the aircraft's navigational system.  To mitigate the possibility of interference with other aircraft the maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) must be such that the calculated or measured emissions at 1575.42MHz (L1) and 1227.6 MHz (L2) are no greater than -141dB/24MHz as received by an isotropic antenna at a distance of 10 meters from the aircraft skin with all access doors open.<br><br>b. Compatibility.  The GPS RTK must be compatible with all aircraft that support military freefall operations such as CASA 212, C-23, C-130 Series (T), and C-17, CH-47, CH-53 and UH-60 (T=O).<br><br>Rationale:  The PARANAVSYS will be used on a variety of aircraft for both training and HAHO operations.  The GPS RTK must be capable of installation onboard all potential aircraft and rebroadcast to an area containing up to 15 jumpers.  A versatile RTK will be required which can be easily installed on each of these aircraft without a change in GPS signal rebroadcast performance or reliability.  To account for the different sized aircraft which may be used the GPS RTK will have an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level that can be adjusted based on aircraft type.  The RTK will also be configurable to accommodate different aircraft sizes with one or several passive antennas as required.  Power will be supplied through either a DC connection to the aircraft or through a BA5590 Lithium Sulfur Dioxide battery.  Power interface and EMI will be tested in accordance with MIL STD 704, 461F and 464A. The GPS RTK will function in a rugged operational environment and be tested in accordance with MIL STD 810-G.  <br><br>c. Reliability.  The GPS RTK will meet the system level reliability requirements specified in Capability 3 above.  The RTK system must provide a 95 percent probability of achieving a successful mission.  A successful mission will be free from the occurrence of a system abort (SA) for a period of 3 hours (T) 6 hours (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Operators are required to conduct mission planning throughout a 96 hour timeframe and the system may be required to be in use for a 6 hour uninterrupted use during operation within the 96 hour period,  System reliability less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.  A system abort (SA) for the GPS RTK is defined as a failure to rebroadcast L1 and/or L2 signals onboard a required aircraft despite outside signal availability and proper GPS receiver functioning for the navigation unit.  A SA is declared only after standard troubleshooting procedures have been followed and have failed to correct the problem.<br><br>22. Landing Zone.<br><br>a. Quantity.  Selectable Landing Zones will be three (T) and five (O).<br><br>Rationale:   The optional drop zones give the jumper the ability to select alternate drop zones in case primary drop zones cannot be reached.  This provides additional means for mission success and force protection, as teams will have the <br>ability to stay assembled.  This will enhance their situational awareness.   <br><br>b. Entry Coordinate System.  Entry coordinate system will be user selectable to Decimal Degrees, Degrees-Decimal Minutes, Degrees-Minutes-Seconds, UTM, and MGRS.<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to enter any method of information into the system for correct location monitoring.<br><br>c. Coordinate Conversion.  System shall conduct coordinate conversion from MGRS to Lat Long and Lat Long to MGRS.<br><br>Rationale: Both coordinate systems are routinely used during HAHO operations.  Conversions between the two coordinate systems are frequently needed. <br><br>23. Wind Data.<br><br>a. Magnitude Entry.  Magnitude entry will be whole number knots (T) and user selectable whole number mph, kph, and knots (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to retrieve any method of measuring wind speed. <br><br>b. Direction.  Direction will be whole degrees.<br><br>Rationale:  Whole degrees are a standard means of articulating direction using a compass.<br><br>c. Data Entry. Wind data will at a minimum be uploadable from the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN) forecast files with manual entry available as an alternative.<br><br>Rationale:  This provides the option of automatically uploading or manually entering wind data.<br><br>d. Altitude.  Altitude (MSL) will be from 0 ft, 3000 ft, 6000 ft, 9000 ft, 12000 ft, 18000 ft, 24000ft, 30000 ft (T) and user selectable between feet and meters (m) in 1000 ft increments (or metric equivalent) to 35,000 ft, and receive and interpolate sonde data (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to use either standard measurements in feet or measurements in meters.  Sonde data collection via the JPADS MP is an objective.<br><br>24. System Requirements.  System shall be embedded with Windows based operating system.<br><br>Rationale:  Windows will be used as the operating system.  The operating system will be compatible with Windows XP or a more recent Windows version. <br>                  <br>25. Send/Confirmation.  Mission Planning software capable of displaying on the Mission Planner screen information to send to each of the jumpers (15 minimum) and a screen showing that each GPS unit has received the data and has been updated with the latest information.<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to confirm the information being sent and verify that the information was received by all jumpers.<br><br>26. DATA stream to GPS unit.<br>  <br>a. Mission Planning.  Mission planning screen displays LZ locations, setup units, user ID, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), and parachute characteristics (K factor, safety factor and glide ratio).<br><br>Rationale:  This setup information will insure that all jumpers have the right information pertaining to the parachute system that is being used and that key information needed has been received.<br><br>b. Operational Mode.  Operational mode screen displays LZ locations, setup units, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), and parachute characteristics (T), and operational mode screen displays LZ locations, setup units, user ID, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), parachute characteristics, IDs and locations of other jumpers and/or cargo bundles using line of sight or other enhanced communication technologies (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Threshold information provides mission planning considerations.

<DESC>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Fort Belvoir, VA is conducting a market survey to locate potential manufacturers or suppliers of a Parachute Navigation System (PARANAVSYS) for use during Military Freefall (MFF) operations.  PARANAVSYS is a multipurpose navigation device designed for Military Free Fall (MFF) operations use pre-jump in aircraft, during infiltration and on-ground follow-on missions, and will allow for enhanced mission planning and improved MFF parachutist infiltration capabilities.  The PARANAVSYS will consist of a Navigation Unit, mounting hardware and a GPS Retransmission Kit (GPS RTK).  A description of each component is as follows:<br>       <br>Navigation Unit.  The Navigation Unit serves as the centerpiece of the PARANAVSYS and will consist of a portable ruggedized computer hardware platform capable of receiving GPS signals and supporting both navigation and mission planning software required to meet program requirements.  The Navigation Unit will meet all performance parameters and system attributes as specified herein.  The Navigation Unit will be man wearable (chest, wrist or otherwise mounted to the parachutist, ruck sack stowable, etc) and consist of a ruggedized computer platform with a display that will be directly readable by the user.  Systems may also include a remote display to allow the main computing platform to be stowed in a ruck sack or elsewhere on the parachutist.  The Navigation Unit will acquire and process GPS data, control the display, and communicate via a wireless or hardwired data link to a separate mission planning laptop computer as required, or if capable, each unit may also concurrently serve as a mission planner.  The electronics package of the Navigation Unit will be comprised of a micro controller, memory, battery, control switches, GPS receiver/antenna, external PC interface port, wireless receiver/transmitter, and display interface electronics.<br>    <br>Mounting Hardware.  Mounting hardware will be required to secure the Navigation Unit firmly to the jumper during MFF operations.  Mounting hardware will interface directly with the MOLLE vest and a support belt for chest mounted systems or by other secure means for other systems. Mounting hardware will not interfere in any way with standard MFF equipment, or the parachutist's ability to operate their canopy or any other standard MFF equipment.<br><br>GPS Retransmission Kit (GPS RTK).  A GPS RTK will be required to provide a GPS signal onboard all training and operational aircraft to take full advantage of the capabilities of the PARANAVSYS during MFF High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) operations.  GPS availability prior to exit allows the jumpmaster to identify a pre-planned release point based on target information and weather data entered during the mission planning phase. GPS rebroadcast onboard the aircraft will also allow the system to reacquire satellites from a "warm start" with a pre-acquired almanac as opposed to a "cold start" with an empty almanac. <br>       <br>Additionally, the PARANAVSYS shall have the following capabilities:<br><br>(Threshold (T) = Objective (O) unless otherwise specified)<br><br>1. Network Ready.  PARANAVSYS shall be Network Ready per CJCSI 6212.01E, 15 Dec 08, and USA TRADOC CPD Writing Guide, dated 16 Jun 09, IER Matrix/IT/NSS/GIG<br><br>Rationale:  PARANAVSYS must properly interface with joint and service enterprise systems comprising the Global Information Grid.<br><br>2. System GPS Accuracy.   The PARANAVSYS must provide guidance for jumpers to successfully deploy to a designated target.  Using system GPS guidance alone, jumpers must reach a pre-designated drop zone and verify that the system can successfully locate the impact point within 100 ft (T), and verify that the system can successfully locate the impact point within 50 ft (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Accuracy requirements less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.<br><br>3. System Reliability.  The system must provide a 95 percent probability of achieving a successful mission.  A successful mission will be free from the occurrence of a system abort (SA) for a period of 3 hours (T) 6 hours (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Operators are required to conduct mission planning throughout a 96 hour timeframe and the system may be required to be in use for up to a 3 hour or more uninterrupted use during operation within that 96 hour period.  System reliability less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.  The definition of a SA will be defined in the failure Definition and Scoring Criteria (FD&SC).<br> 	<br>4. Operational Environmental Parameters.  <br><br>a. Altitude.  Must operate at an altitude of up to 24,999 feet (MSL) (T) and 35,000 feet MSL (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The ability to achieve repeated on-ground accuracy, when aerially released from altitudes beyond the range of most threat weaponry, is the essence of a precision airdrop capability.  High altitude release increases air carrier, aircrew and jumper survivability.  <br><br>b. Minimum and Maximum Temperature.  Operate at a steady temperature of 40 F with a sudden drop to -30 F.  Hold at -30 F for 2 minutes followed by a gradual temperature increase of 2 F/minute for 40 minutes (T), Provide operation at a steady temperature of 40 F with a sudden drop to -65 F. Hold at -65 F for 2 minutes followed by a sudden temperature increase of 35 F in 75 seconds then a gradual temperature increase of 2 F/minute for 40 minutes (O).<br><br>Rationale:  These temperature profiles model worst case exposure times for an exit from 24,999 ft MSL (T) and 35,000 ft MSL (O) based on the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere Temperature Profile.  Temperature variations at altitude and on the DZ can vary greatly and put a high degree of stress on both the individual and equipment. <br><br>c. Mechanical Shock:  Unit to withstand 7g's shock with all accompanying attachments and remain functional (T).  Unit to withstand 10g's and dropped from 36 inches onto concrete and remain functional (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The system will need to withstand any shock that is anticipated during an airborne operation.  This includes any and all harness and restraint attachments required for system mounting.<br><br>d. Light Conditions.  The system shall work in day or night light conditions.<br><br>Rationale:  The system will not be limited to visual light conditions and will facilitate safe and effective use, as unit is required to be used during any and all conditions that the system will be doctrinally and operationally allowed.<br><br>5. System Storage Environmental Parameters.  Minimum and Maximum Temperature in accordance with MIL STD 810-E.<br><br>Rationale:  The system will be stored in a wide variety of temperatures and requires a minimum and maximum parameter in accordance with MIL STD 810-E.<br><br>6. System Laptop Connection.  Laptop connection must be hardwired and wireless.<br><br>Rationale:  The system must have a hardwired and wireless capability as both a threshold and objective.  The contingency if the wireless fails will be hardwired.<br><br>7. System GPS Type.  GPS type must be Commercial GPS (training mode), Military SAASM via attachable DAGR (operational) external to the system (T) and Military SAASM (internal to the system) (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Systems will have internal commercial GPS.  A SAASM GPS capability may be provided via an attachable DAGR radio as a threshold.   Internal Military SAASM GPS without a DAGR attachment is an objective.<br><br>8. System User Operated Buttons.  <br><br>a. Power.  Manual power (on/off) control is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required for simplicity and muscle memory.    <br><br>b. Landing Zone.  User selectable Landing Zone option is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required for switching from one screen to another.  <br><br>c. Brightness.  Brightness adjustment is user-controlled (T), automatically adjusts based on ambient light (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Buttons are required to vary the brightness on the system display.  Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light without user control is an objective.<br><br>d. Multi-Display Page.  Multi-Display Page user operated buttons are required to utilize and toggle between the other existing display screens.<br><br>Rationale:  One switch is required for simplicity and muscle memory.<br><br>e. SAASM GPS Zeroization.  SAASM GPS Zeroization shall be one hand multi-key zeroization.<br><br>Rationale:  SAASM GPS zeroization erases all data from memory for security purposes.  Because of the result of this function, it must be difficult to perform to ensure the operation is intentional and not accidental.  A required simultaneous three key activation will help to ensure that this is only intentional.<br>            <br>9. System Display Pages.<br><br>a. Navigational Page.  Navigation display page(s) are required (T). Standard and sharable geospatial data (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Display pages assist the jumper to properly navigate to the appropriate drop zone.  All new systems require geospatial information as required by ASA (ALT) as of 21 Dec 2007.<br><br>b. Jump Master Page.  Jump master display page(s) are required.<br><br>Rationale:  The jump master display will be accessible to all jumpers and will greatly enhance the JM in correctly identifying the release point.  It will also give real-time situational awareness in the aircraft prior to executing an airborne operation.<br><br>c. Mission Planning Page.  Mission planning software and display page(s) are required.<br><br>Rationale:  Mission planning software and display on all systems allows for redundancy in mission planning and system commonality for training.<br><br>d. Deconfliction Page.  Jumper and Cargo Bundle Deconfliction/Collision Avoidance display page(s) are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This technology and accompanying human factors considerations such as information over load are not yet mature enough to incorporate into the system.  This capability will include the ability to track other jumpers' locations, both altitude and azimuth, and provide a warning if a mid-air collision is imminent.  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available.<br><br>e. Topographic Page.  Topographic display page(s) are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This technology is not yet thought to be mature enough to incorporate into the system.  This capability will include different topographical displays to aid jumper orientation.  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available.<br>                     <br>f. Moving Maps.  Moving maps are required (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This capability will be a product improvement when the technology is available. This will include AGE compliant map data including Raster product Format types, Common Imagery Baseline, Compressed Arc Digitized Raster Graphic, Vector format types, Vector Product Format and shapefile.<br><br>g. Geospatial Data.  Geospatial Information Officer approved Geospatial Data is required.<br><br>Rationale:  All new systems require geospatial information as required by ASA (ALT) as of 21 Dec 2007.   <br>             <br>10. System Optical Parameters.<br><br>a. Focus.  Focus will be fixed (T) and adjustable (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Optical focus will be fixed as a threshold and adjustable as an objective.  The objective capability will greatly enhance the optical interface by allowing a user to adjust focus to meet individual preference. <br><br>b. Alignment.  Alignment will be fixed (T) and adjustable (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Optical alignment will be fixed as a threshold and adjustable as an objective.  The objective capability will greatly enhance the optical interface by allowing a user to adjust alignment to meet individual preference.<br><br>11. System Navigation Units. <br><br>a. Speed.  Speed will be displayed as knots (T) and miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and knots (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the choices needed in case different modes of speed are needed.<br><br>b. Direction.  Direction will be displayed as whole degrees.<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the ability to track his or her direction in whole degrees.<br><br>c. Distance.  Distance will be displayed as kilometers (T) and miles (statute), kilometers, and nautical miles (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the choices needed in case different modes of distance are required.<br><br>d. Altitude.  Altitude will be displayed as feet (T) and feet and meters (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will give the individual the options in case different modes of altitude are required. <br><br>12. Satellite Acquisition Parameters.<br><br>a. GPS Lock.  GPS lock required within 10 min of cold start provided a continuous GPS signal with no physical or environmental obstacles preventing satellite reception (T).  GPS lock required within 20 seconds of warm start provided a continuous GPS signal with no physical or environmental obstacles preventing satellite reception (O).<br><br>Rationale:  GPS lock must be acquired quickly in order for the system to perform as needed.  A warm start refers to a system start in which the GPS almanac has already been acquired.  This allows for quick GPS lock reacquisition and is distinct from a "cold start" in which the almanac has not been acquired and may take much longer for GPS lock to be acquired given current technology.<br><br>b. Speed.  Speed will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br><br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.   <br><br>c. Direction.  Direction will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br><br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.<br><br>d. Distance.  Distance will be determined by GPS signal quality.<br><br>Rationale:  The system has the ability to lock on to at least 5 satellites, however environmental effects may hinder the GPS signal quality.  Having more satellites that are locked provides the best ability for accurate information.<br><br>e. Altitude.  Altitude will be determined by GPS elevation data (T) and a barometric altimeter (O).<br><br>Rationale: GPS elevation data will be displayed as part of the Navigation and Jumpmaster pages.  While reliable this information can occasionally be inconsistent with pressure altitude; as an objective it is desired to include a barometric altimeter as part of the system which is available on COTS/NDI GPS receivers.<br><br>13. System Battery Parameters.<br><br>a. Duration.  Battery duration will be 3 hours (T) and >6 hours (O).  <br><br>Rationale:  The typical airborne operation is time consuming.  Systems will be required to perform for at least 3 hours, but optimally, greater than 6 hours with the option of using multiple soldier power sources to supplement for follow-on use.  To enable this, the unit will have a jack to accept a 12V DC power source. <br><br>b. Rechargeable.  Battery will be rechargeable and removable.<br><br>Rationale:  Battery to be rechargeable for economy and be removable for replacement.<br><br>c. Warning.  Low battery warning is required.<br><br>Rationale:  Low battery warning is essential for mission success.<br><br>d. Hot Swappable.  Battery will have 'hot swappable' capability to enable batteries to be swapped without loss of power (O).<br><br>Rationale:  The "hot swappable" capability will allow depleted batteries to be replaced with fully charged ones without the loss of any mission critical data such as the GPS almanac.<br><br>14. System Size.  The system will be as small and sleek as possible and fit into a protective case equal to or less than 8 inches wide, 3 inches deep and 7 inches in height.  <br><br>Rationale:  Size is always a consideration and prevention of line snags is critical.  Restriction to the given size envelope is needed to mitigate the risk of equipment interference.<br><br>15. System Weight.  System weight will be equal to or less than 5 lbs (T), 2.5 lbs (O). <br><br>Rationale:  Weight is an important consideration and should be kept to a minimum.  Higher weight would be a hindrance to the jumper and possibly degrade the success of the airborne operations.<br><br>16. System Data Refresh/Update Rate.<br><br>a. System.  System refresh/update rate of one (1) Hertz required.<br><br>Rationale:  The one (1) hertz speed is recommended as it will adequately refresh and update the system.<br><br>b. GPS Receiver.  GPS receiver able to log data points at a rate of at least one (1) per second.<br><br>Rationale:  The one (1) hertz speed is recommended in order to record and post data in real time while in freefall and under canopy. <br><br>17. Helmet Interface.  System must interface with Standard Military Gentex Parachutist, Gentex PM HALO, Commercial Pro-Tec, ACH (T) and Standard Military Gentex Parachutist, Gentex PM HALO, Commercial Pro-Tec & any Improved Ballistic Helmet Design (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will allow the jumper to use the system with any helmet they are issued.<br><br>18. Goggle Interface.  System must interface and attach to all goggles currently used for MFF operations (T) and Standard Gentex Parachutist Goggle, Gentex Wind Blast Face Shield, Custom Design Goggle with integrated display, compatible with night vision devices (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This will allow the jumper to use with any set of goggles they are issued.  As an objective it is desired that the system interface with night vision devices to realize the full capability of the PARANAVSYS for night time operations. <br><br>19. Maintainability.  The system will have maintainability of not more than 72 hours Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). <br><br>Rationale:  This will allow commanders to maintain operational capability, minimizing down time for maintenance.<br><br>20. Display Connection to the Navigation Unit computer.  The system display will be hardwired to the Navigation Unit computer (T), connected via wireless communication (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Current COTS technology requires a hardwired connection to the Navigation Unit computer for utilizing the display capability.  A wireless connection is preferred as a P3I objective requirement in order to minimize the risk of equipment interference.<br><br>21. GPS Retransmission Kit.  The system will include a GPS Retransmission Kit (RTK) to rebroadcast GPS signal onboard the operational aircraft prior to personnel exit.  The GPS retransmission kit will have the following performance characteristics:<br><br>a. L1/L2 Signals.  The GPS RTK shall be able to receive and rebroadcast both L1 and L2 GPS signals with no interference to the aircraft.<br><br>Rationale: GPS signal must be available onboard all training and operational aircraft to take full advantage of the capabilities of the PARANAVSYS.  GPS availability prior to exit will allow the jumpmaster to use the jumpmaster display screen for release point identification.  GPS rebroadcast onboard the aircraft will also allow the system to reacquire satellites from a "warm start" with a pre-acquired almanac as opposed to a "cold start" with an empty almanac which may take much longer.  <br><br>The GPS RTK shall rebroadcast both commercial and military GPS signals in the bands 1575.42 +/- 12 MHz (L1) and 1227.6 +/- 12MHz (L2).  The RTK shall be designed to ensure that all efforts are taken to mitigate the rebroadcast of all signals outside of these bands.  Any such emissions must be attenuated to a negligible level so that the GPS RTK will not interfere with the aircraft's navigational system.  To mitigate the possibility of interference with other aircraft the maximum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) must be such that the calculated or measured emissions at 1575.42MHz (L1) and 1227.6 MHz (L2) are no greater than -141dB/24MHz as received by an isotropic antenna at a distance of 10 meters from the aircraft skin with all access doors open.<br><br>b. Compatibility.  The GPS RTK must be compatible with all aircraft that support military freefall operations such as CASA 212, C-23, C-130 Series (T), and C-17, CH-47, CH-53 and UH-60 (T=O).<br><br>Rationale:  The PARANAVSYS will be used on a variety of aircraft for both training and HAHO operations.  The GPS RTK must be capable of installation onboard all potential aircraft and rebroadcast to an area containing up to 15 jumpers.  A versatile RTK will be required which can be easily installed on each of these aircraft without a change in GPS signal rebroadcast performance or reliability.  To account for the different sized aircraft which may be used the GPS RTK will have an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) level that can be adjusted based on aircraft type.  The RTK will also be configurable to accommodate different aircraft sizes with one or several passive antennas as required.  Power will be supplied through either a DC connection to the aircraft or through a BA5590 Lithium Sulfur Dioxide battery.  Power interface and EMI will be tested in accordance with MIL STD 704, 461F and 464A. The GPS RTK will function in a rugged operational environment and be tested in accordance with MIL STD 810-G.  <br><br>c. Reliability.  The GPS RTK will meet the system level reliability requirements specified in Capability 3 above.  The RTK system must provide a 95 percent probability of achieving a successful mission.  A successful mission will be free from the occurrence of a system abort (SA) for a period of 3 hours (T) 6 hours (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Operators are required to conduct mission planning throughout a 96 hour timeframe and the system may be required to be in use for a 6 hour uninterrupted use during operation within the 96 hour period,  System reliability less than those stated would jeopardize successful accomplishment of the airdrop mission and could provide an unsafe environment for the MFF jumper.  A system abort (SA) for the GPS RTK is defined as a failure to rebroadcast L1 and/or L2 signals onboard a required aircraft despite outside signal availability and proper GPS receiver functioning for the navigation unit.  A SA is declared only after standard troubleshooting procedures have been followed and have failed to correct the problem.<br><br>22. Landing Zone.<br><br>a. Quantity.  Selectable Landing Zones will be three (T) and five (O).<br><br>Rationale:   The optional drop zones give the jumper the ability to select alternate drop zones in case primary drop zones cannot be reached.  This provides additional means for mission success and force protection, as teams will have the ability to stay assembled.  This will enhance their situational awareness.   <br><br>b. Entry Coordinate System.  Entry coordinate system will be user selectable to Decimal Degrees, Degrees-Decimal Minutes, Degrees-Minutes-Seconds, UTM, and MGRS.<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to enter any method of information into the system for correct location monitoring.<br><br>c. Coordinate Conversion.  System shall conduct coordinate conversion from MGRS to Lat Long and Lat Long to MGRS.<br><br>Rationale: Both coordinate systems are routinely used during HAHO operations.  Conversions between the two coordinate systems are frequently needed. <br><br>23. Wind Data.<br><br>a. Magnitude Entry.  Magnitude entry will be whole number knots (T) and user selectable whole number mph, kph, and knots (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to retrieve any method of measuring wind speed. <br><br>b. Direction.  Direction will be whole degrees.<br><br>Rationale:  Whole degrees are a standard means of articulating direction using a compass.<br><br>c. Data Entry. Wind data will at a minimum be uploadable from the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN) forecast files with manual entry available as an alternative.<br><br>Rationale:  This provides the option of automatically uploading or manually entering wind data.<br><br>d. Altitude.  Altitude (MSL) will be from 0 ft, 3000 ft, 6000 ft, 9000 ft, 12000 ft, 18000 ft, 24000ft, 30000 ft (T) and user selectable between feet and meters (m) in 1000 ft increments (or metric equivalent) to 35,000 ft, and receive and interpolate sonde data (O).<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to use either standard measurements in feet or measurements in meters.  Sonde data collection via the JPADS MP is an objective.<br><br>24. System Requirements.  System shall be embedded with Windows based operating system.<br><br>Rationale:  Windows will be used as the operating system.  The operating system will be compatible with Windows XP or a more recent Windows version. <br>                  <br>25. Send/Confirmation.  Mission Planning software capable of displaying on the Mission Planner screen information to send to each of the jumpers (15 minimum) and a screen showing that each GPS unit has received the data and has been updated with the latest information.<br><br>Rationale:  This gives the option to confirm the information being sent and verify that the information was received by all jumpers.<br><br>26. DATA stream to GPS unit.<br>  <br>a. Mission Planning.  Mission planning screen displays LZ locations, setup units, user ID, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), and parachute characteristics (K factor, safety factor and glide ratio).<br><br>Rationale:  This setup information will insure that all jumpers have the right information pertaining to the parachute system that is being used and that key information needed has been received.<br><br>b. Operational Mode.  Operational mode screen displays LZ locations, setup units, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), and parachute characteristics (T), and operational mode screen displays LZ locations, setup units, user ID, wind data (directions, magnitudes, and altitudes), parachute characteristics, IDs and locations of other jumpers and/or cargo bundles using line of sight or other enhanced communication technologies (O).<br><br>Rationale:  Threshold information provides mission planning considerations.  Objective information, when available, will give all jumpers situational awareness to mitigate the risk of in-air collisions with cargo bundles and/or jumpers in the air.       <br><br>27. Interface Display.<br><br>a. Mission Planning.  Mission planning displays user ID, confirmation of update of info.<br><br>Rationale:  The mission planning information will insure that all jumpers have the right information pertaining to the parachute system that is being used and that key information needed has been received.<br><br>b. Operational Mode.  Operational mode displays confirmation of update of info.   <br><br>Rationale:  The operational mode will insure that all jumpers have the right information pertaining to the parachute system that is being used and that key information needed has been received.<br><br>c. Operational Mode User ID/Location.

<CONTACT>Vanessa Barreto-Wynkoop Contracting Officer 7039643694     vanessa.barreto@aqd.nbc.gov;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to Request for Information (RFI) number D11PS63927, posted on March 16, 2011, under the FedBizOpps classification code 70, entitled "Sources Sought for Financial Services Center (FSC) Help Desk technology."  The purpose of this amendment is to post responses to questions received.
Question #1:  Is the government open to considering a completely outsourced solution which would encompass outsourced call-taking capability (through hosted telco infrastructure), agent staffing and workforce management, quality monitoring, and hosted software-as-a-service cloud application services for the ticket management, knowledge management, and analytics capabilities?
Response to question #1:  Not at this time.
Question #2:  Would the government be open to considering the outsourcing of the Tier 1 function, while continuing to have higher-skilled Tier 2 and Tier 3 personnel employees continue to perform in the roles they do today?
Response to question #2:  Not at this time.
Question #3:  The DOI AQD issued a RFQ on 4 March 2011 # RFQ D11PS18902 for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Financial Services Center (FSC) which included a Performance Work Statement (PWS) titled "Automation and Integration of Business Practices Using Microsoft Dynamics" dated February 15, 2011 (Attachment 1).  From what we can conclude the Enterprise Business Management System has requested a CRM product development.  How does this differ from this Help Desk Consolidation and "the idea is based on the evidence that consolidation and efficiency opportunities increase dramatically with standardization across the VA"?  Is the idea that vendors should submit a MS Dynamics based solution for standardization across FSC?
Response to question #3:  Enterprise Business Management System is a separate initiative for the FSC business office which focuses on business plans, service level agreements, and customer service for specific customers.  This RFI addresses a much larger number of customers both internal and external to VA.  Although MS Dynamics could be the solution, FSC is interested in what is the best solution for this variety and number of help desk calls.
Question #4:  Different COTS Help Desk solutions are designed for small, medium, and large help desk environments.  Please provide the estimated quantities below for the new consolidated Help Desk so vendors can identify solution that best matches the VA-FSC environment.a.  Total number of Tier One Support Analysts (include both VA-FSC federal government staff and VA-FSC Service Provider contractor staff who provide Tier One support)b.  Total number of Tier Two Support Analysts (include both VA-FSC federal government staff and VA-FSC Service Provider contractor staff who provide Tier Two support)c.  Average number of Help Desk tickets per monthd.  Average number of Help Desk tickets resolved by Tier 1 per month
Response to question #4:  a. 50, b. 50, c. 30,000, and d. 20,000
Question #5:  The Sources Sought notice focuses on incoming phone calls.  While all COTS help desk ticketing tools support phone-based help desk operations, many are optimized for end user access via email and web portal.  The information requested below will allow vendors to determine if their help desk solution aligns with the VA-FSC environment.a.  Does VA-FSC also process end-user email requests for service?  If yes, what percent of the end user requests are submitted via email?b.  Does VA-FSC have a web portal for end-users to submit requests?  If yes, what percent of the end user requests are submitted via the web portal?
Response to question #5:  a. Some help desks have an e-mail Group where requests are submitted; however, there is currently no way for the e-mail to generate a ticket and to be tracked nor transferred within a system other than Outlook.  Unknown, best guess would be 30%.  b. Unknown.
Question #6:  What vendor software tools does the VA-FSC currently use on the ten separate Help Desks to track and manage help desk incidents and service requests?
Response to question #6:  IT Help Desk uses MAGIC.  Customer Service Help Desk (CSHD) uses a home-grown application built on .Net technology.  The other Help Desks have no software tools.
Question #7:  Can VA-FSC provide some context for this Sources Sought including how it relates to RFIs and RFQs for ITIL-based Help Desk software that VA-FSC released in Aug 2007, Jan 2008, April 2008 and Dec 2008?
Response to question #7:  ITIL-based Help Desk software is geared heavily to IT issues.  Other than the IT Help Desk, FSC has various functional user help desks, and we have no knowledge of strictly IT-based help desk software which could be utilized/adapted for the other help desk areas which include Payroll questions, Vendor Inquiries, Permanent Change of Station (relocation services), Medical Care Claims, accounting questions/issues, etc.

A MODIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE 1ST PARAGRAPH:

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Hasan Albacha-Hejazi since his clinic is one of few clinics in the Syrian Arab Republic able to collect data and biological specimens from families with a history of many family members affected with oral clefts. In order to ensure detection of all important genetic effects, data collection from multiple families and family members are needed to improve the power of the study.  Dr. Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, of the IBN Al-Nafees Hospital in Damascus, Syria, has identified additional new families from Syrian individuals which will provide a larger sample pool.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases.  The Division=s research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.  Research also includes planning and conducting clinical trials to test DNA-based methods for treatment and perhaps the cure of such diseases.  Researchers collect and study families in which important diseases are inherited as well as, translate basic science advances into effective, reliable, and cost effective DNA and cytogenetic-based diagnostics.  This contract covers work to be performed as part of a continued collaborative effort under protocol OH97-HG-N035 approved by the NHGRI Institutional Review Board. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH is conducting a study of the inherited susceptibility to oral clefts, with emphasis on non-syndromic oral clefts. 

The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis, association analysis and gene mapping strategies.  Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease. As such, clinical data, family history data and blood samples from individuals in large families with multiple individuals affected with oral clefts is needed. Large families with multiple living affected family members are rare in the United States, given todays small average sibship size, and thus it is important to obtain data on such families from countries where such families are more common. In the Syrian Arab Republic, family sizes are large and intergeneration times are much shorter than in the U.S. 
These services are needed since it would not be feasible, either logistically or financially, to bring the members of the participating families to the U.S to be seen at the NIH and investigators at the NIH have no way to identify families with multiple affected individuals who reside in the Syrian Arab Republic. A contract with a local clinician who has proven that he can enroll suitable families is the most efficient and most economical way to conduct this study.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the researchers dedicated to the study.  These services will be in the areas of: determination of eligibility, patient registration, clinical evaluation of family members, biological sample collection and shipment, recontact of previously studied family members as needed by the NIH scientists to update information or consents and to explain clinically relevant results if needed.

https://www.neco.navy.mil/ under solicitation number N0002411R4207.  It is also noted that this draft TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR DDG 51 HED - EPS PRODUCTION HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT has several requirements that are yet to be defined or specified, noted as TBDs on the document, and ranges of possible values are indicated where known.  The Navy is interested in feedback on this draft technical performance specification in areas that would drive in cost or otherwise add requirements that could be eliminated without detrimental impact to performance.
  The opportunity for providing that feedback can take the form of a written response or be discussed during the one-on-one meetings described during the November 17, 2010 Industry Day.  These sessions are planned for January 2011 and arrangement for a 2-hour time slot can be made by contacting Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or by calling 202-781-2629.  The previously released draft Request for Proposal package may contain contradictions to this draft technical performance specification since it had been written to accommodate the numerous requirements options as presented at the Industry Day and the final RFP and technical performance specification will include all requirements.
  Other documents may also be posted under this TDP Link in the future. All questions or comments should be directed to Tara Borntreger by email at tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command will be conducting a second Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day for the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer (DDG 51) Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) Electric Propulsion System (EPS) Backfit acquisition.  This follow-on Industry Day will be held at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), Philadelphia, PA.  The date for this Industry Day will be March 9, 2011.  Additional details will be posted subsequently under this solicitation number.  The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an opportunity to gather more information prior to the Request for Proposals (RFP) being issued. Several documents are available at this link and the associated Technical Data Package (TDP) link on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website, https://www.neco.navy.mil/ under solicitation number N0002411R4207.
 The Navy continues to be interested in feedback on the draft RFP and technical performance specification in areas that would drive in cost, increase schedule or otherwise add requirements that could be eliminated without detrimental impact to performance.  As mentioned during the original Industry Day held November 17, 2010, the opportunity for providing feedback can take the form of a written response or be discussed during the one-on-one meetings. These one-on-one meetings need to occur during January 2011 through early February 2011 in order to meet the March 2011 date for formal RFP release and arrangement for a 2-hour time slot can be made by contacting Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or by calling 202-781-2629.
 In order to adequately plan for these meetings, it is requested that interested parties make contact no later than January 20, 2011 to secure a timeslot.  Requests submitted after January 20, 2011 may not be considered.  All questions or comments should be directed to Tara Borntreger by email at tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

<DESC>As stated during the Hybrid Electric Drive Industry Day held November 17, 2010, NAVSEA is hosting a second Industry Day to introduce a revised draft RFP and draft specification reflecting updated Navy requirements and feedback from industry. Also included will be an opportunity to view the Navys Land Based Engineering Site (LBES) where HED EPS will be evaluated prior to ship installation and where the HED EPS Proof of Concept (PoC) system will be tested.  The Navy continues to be interested in feedback on the draft solicitation and technical performance specification in areas that would drive cost, increase schedule or otherwise add requirements, all of which potentially could be eliminated without detrimental impact to in-service performance.
 As this is not a solicitation, no attendee firm should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance. Questions and conversation that appear to steer in this direction will be discouraged.

Please limit attendance from each company to four individuals as the total attendance will be limited. Attendance for the facility tour is very limited so only two individuals from any interested company will be permitted, up to the limit of the group size allowed, on a first-come-first-served basis.  Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens and must represent bona fide US Department of Defense (DoD) contractors as the presentation materials may include limited distribution information.
  Evidence in the form of an executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to admission. Please pre-register via email to the following address: joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil no later than Tuesday March 1, 2011. Registration will be confirmed via a responding e-mail and failure to register will prohibit admittance.  Please provide the individuals name, company, phone and e-mail address in addition to the DD 2345 (reference to DD 2345 submitted for the November 17, 2010 Industry Day may be accepted in lieu of a new form).  In addition to the requirement to pre-register, there are access requirements to gain access to the Naval Surface Warfare Center contained on the attached document that must be followed or access will be denied.
  Questions about these access requirements can be addressed to joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil.  The Government intends to publish a list of attendees to encourage subcontracting opportunities.  Note: This is NOT a "bidders conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind that would otherwise obligate the Government. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for travel, presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

Date: Wednesday, March 9, 2011

Time: Check-in at 9:30am; General Session from 10:00am to 3:00pm; Facility Tour from 4:00pm to 6:00pm.

Location: Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Building 77L, Melville Conference Room, Philadelphia Naval Business Center, Philadelphia PA 19112.

<DESC>NOTE: This RFI was posted to seek sources of HPAs. Except for the specifications already posted, we have not established any other specifications. We are interested in learning about any HPA capabilities higher than the minimum as well as any capabilities/specifications not specifically listed. This RFI is to help us learn what devices/capabilities/specifications are available on the market now. The system that will potentially use the HPAs has not been designed yet. The purpose of the RFI is to identify what is currently available in all types of HPAs and then use that information to design a system that has a HPA that is generally COTS.
<p><br />Q1. Request some clarification of the vibrations section of the RFI. We have shipped products to the Navy in the past, and the vibration specification seems to be out of family. Is the intent of the spec 0.4G2/Hz(approx. 20Grms), not 0.04G2/Hz(Approx. 2 Grms) or something similar, which is more typical</p>
<p>A1. The 0.04g2/Hz and its equivalent 2 Grms is the intended spec. Please include any higher capabilities of your products in the RFI response.</p>
<p>The vibration spec of 0.4g2/Hz is changed to : 0.04g2/Hz</p>
<p><br />Q2. Can any light be shed on the application of these HPA's, i.e. the shipboard use or intended uses. Is this just to add to a repertoire of off the shelf products. Since they are asking for a ROM is there a bracket that they prefer?</p>
<p>A2. Shipboard use. No preference, need to know what is available. No budget has been established.</p>
<p>Q3. Is a more detailed specification available that would define the topics listed below.</p>
<p>Prime Power, Source Voltage, Overall Efficiency, Harmonics, Size, Weight, Available Coolant (conduction, liquid, etc); <br />And if the amplifier sought can be either/or a TWT or MPM.</p>
<p>A3. No Specifications have been established outside of those already published. The amplifier could be either the TWT or MPM.</p>
<p><br />Q4. In reviewing the specs for the 6-18 GHz. HPA RFI there is no mention of the load VSWR that the HPA has to operate into without being damaged. Do you have a number for this or can I assume a VSWR of 3.0:1 Max. without damage?</p>
<p>A4. We do not currently have a specification for VSWR established. You can assume a max VSWR of 3:1 for the load if that is the highest VSWR your HPA can operate into without being damaged.</p>
<p><br />Q5. Could you please provide clarification pertaining to the Mechanical Characteristic "RF Output Connector" which in the solicitation is stated as "RF Output Connector //Waveguide, TNC". One could interpret this as meaning there is no "Desired" only an "Acceptable" characteristic defined.</p>
<p>A5. That is correct, there is no preference for a "Desired" specification on the RF Output Connector. The system that will potentially use the HPAs has not been designed yet. The purpose of the RFI is to identify what is currently available in all types of HPAs.</p>
<p><br />Q6. If NRL were to award a FFP contract, would the award occur within the next 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years or would it be beyond 3 years?</p>
<p>A6. We have not yet identified a timeline. The purpose of the RFI is to identify what is currently available in all types of HPAs.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation will require proposals to be submitted within 30 days of solicitation release.
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal must contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that must otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>

The reconstruction will extend from Station 133+00 to Station 155+00. The intent of the embankment excavation is to remove the high plasticity clay that is prone to desiccation cracking and replacement of the existing drainage system with a horizontal blanket, chimney drain, and drain pipe at the levee toe to establish positive site drainage to a RD900 pump station. This improvement is intended to address the primary failure mechanisms by reducing the amount of desiccation cracking and saturation of the landside levee slope. The addition of the drain pipe and surrounding drain rock fill at the levee toe is intended to reduce the uplift gradient to acceptable levels. Because, the recommended embankment excavation will extend into the levee crest the crest roadway shall not be used during construction.<br><br>It is anticipated that the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued on or about April 7, 2011, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

This requirement is being awarded as a labor hour type purchase order. The purchase order is for professional consultant support services and was competed and awarded in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded contract number HHSN-276-2011-00357U to Anne P. Sassman</p>
<p>Anne P. Sassaman<br />201 Bolinwood Dr<br />Chapel Hill, NC 27514-2653<br />Award Amount: $21,138<br />Total Estimated Award Amount: $63,414.00 (incl. option periods)<br />Task Order No.: HHSN-276-2011-00283P<br />Period of Performance: March 21, 2011 through March 20, 2012 with Two (2) 12-Month Option Periods <br />(DUNS No. 788877780).</p>
<p>This initiative provides support to assist the Office of Extramural Research, with reviewing complex scientific material in order to provide executive consultation and advice at regular meetings of the committee regarding the establishment of new T42 positions; Conversion of existing staff from T5 appointments to T42; analysis of information provided by NIH Institutes/Centers in relation to established criteria; and strategy recommendations for consideration by the NIH ETFC committee.</p>
<p>The ETFC requires expertise and consultation from a source with current working knowledge of the responsibilities of senior extramural scientific positions and the history and intent of using the Title 42 and Title 5 mechanisms.

Additionally, the factors that should be considered by that agency as critical for determining the appropriate use of the Title 42 appointment for non-intramural scientists.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)
CONTRACTOR: Alliant Enterprises, LLC

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VA Las Vegas Healthcare Systems Office, Las Vegas, Nevada, as directed by the VA Las Vegas Healthcare Systems, has a requirement for zoom motorized patient transport, which will require justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  The request is being procured exclusive of competition from a specific vendor.

3. Description of Requirement: Zoom Motorized Patient Transport solution.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The requirements are being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The Stryker Medical Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher meets all of the capability requirements requested by VA Southern Nevada. The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher is an 'exclusive sole source' stretcher product providing unique differentiating features, essential to the facility, that collectively cannot be found in any other product or company in the medical stretcher market. 

1.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher provides an innovative Zoom Motorized Drive System with advanced technology design that virtually eliminates strenuous pushing, pulling and steering which can often result in threatening back injuries. These features not only increase efficiencies but more importantly, contribute to long-term back health.  No competitive products offer this product feature.

2.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher provides "Chaperone Stretcher Exit System".  The Stryker Prime stretcher is the only stretcher available with a two-zone exit alert system using load-cell technology.  This feature alerts the caregivers of patients leaving the stretcher un-assisted, thus preventing patient falls before they occur.  No competitive products offer this product feature.

3.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher is equipped with a Recovery Chair Position. This unique position helps eliminate the need for unnecessary transfers by providing a comfortable position for patients to recover.  This innovative feature makes daily patient handling easier and supports both patient and hospital staff safety. 

4.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher is equipped with an Electric Head End Lift Assist.  A powered head end delivers not only convenience for the patient but provides caregiver safety by reducing the strain when raising and lowering the patient.

5.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher is equipped with an Electric Knee Gatch. The powered knee gatch empowers patients to adjust to their own level of comfort while protecting the caregiver from interruptions, stress and lifting.  

6.	The Prime Electric with Zoom Stretcher is equipped with Zero-gap Glideaway Siderails. With one fluid motion, these Glideway siderails provide maximum patient security when raised and zero transfer gap when lowered.  They provide head-end and foot-end release levers and zero pinch points.

Alliant Healthcare is the sole provider of Stryker products to all Federal Government facilities and as such, all purchases must be made through Alliant. Alliant is a certified veteran-owned small business. 

Additionally, Alliant meets the requirement set by Public Law 109-461, regarding preferential purchasing from veteran-owned small businesses within the VA Federal Supply Schedule sector. 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A notice will not be publicized/synopsized for this procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past prices paid for similar services. Estimated cost is $36,170.08

8. Results of Market Survey: Market research information was obtained from using service.  

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: Full and open competition was not utilized for this contract due to the reasons stated in number 5 above.  

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: N/A
