More specifically Mr. Vinsonhaler has: involvement in the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project study undertaken by Reclamation in conjunction with the State of Washington, the Yakama Nation, and Yakima basin entities during the 1980s and 1990s.  This involved development of a plan of study, structuring and guidance of a study team, preparation of budget documents to support the study and planning activities including assessment of resources, needs, and plan formulation and evaluation.  Coordinated Federal, State, and Tribal Technical Advisory Group reporting to a "Roundtable" comprised of State of Washington Congressional Delegation representatives, Chairman of Yakama Nation, Directors of Washington State Department of Ecology and Agriculture, and regional Director, Pacific Northwest Region, assisted in the development of the implementation plan following the authorization of Yakima River Basin Water Conservation Program in 1994. Mr. Vinsonhaler has direct association with the representatives of the irrigation districts, State and local governments, and the Indian Nation leadership in the Yakima and Columbia River basins,extensive indepth knowledge of Reclamation's laws, policies, and criterion for doing feasibility investigations do to his expertise gained while employed by Reclamation as the Pacific Northwest Regional Planning Officer, extensive knowledge of Washington State laws, water rights, planning procedures, and water resource policies from his past experience as a Reclamation employee working with numerous different state departments such as the Department of Ecology.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Space Science is releasing a DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for community review and comment for the New Frontiers Program-2003 and Missions of Opportunity.  Selections of proposals through the final AO, once released, are intended to select investigations for two different types of scientific investigations: (i) New Frontiers Mission investigations specifically for the planet Venus, the Earth's Moon, Jupiter, or a comet nucleus; and (ii) Mission of Opportunity investigations for all Solar System objects except Mars.   New Frontiers Mission investigations are to be completed through space flight missions launched on Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV's) no later than December 31, 2009, and accomplish the proposed investigation for a total NASA OSS cost not to exceed $650M in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 dollars.	Proposals submitted in response to this AO for New Frontiers Mission investigations must be for complete investigations, defined as a concept study (Phase A), preliminary design (Phase B); final design and development of all flight experiment hardware, spacecraft bus, and mission operations software and equipment (Phase C); spacecraft assembly, test, and launch operations (Phase D); mission operations and data analysis (Phase E); and, if applicable and approved, extended mission operations (Phase F).  Missions must include analysis and publication of data in the peer reviewed scientific literature, delivery of the data to NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and full implementation of an Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) program related to the mission.   Proposals that describe only portions of investigations (such as the provision of an instrument as part of a non-U.S. mission) may, if appropriate, be proposed as Mission of Opportunity (MO) investigations.  In any event, an MO investigation is defined as being part of a "parent" non-OSS space mission of any size whose sponsor requires a commitment of selection and support from NASA before December 31, 2005, that may be accomplished at a cost to NASA OSS of $35M (FY 2003 dollars) or less and that addresses any of the OSS Solar System Exploration (SSE) science objectives except those concerning Mars.  Such MO investigations may involve: (i) the provision of flight hardware followed by data analysis, (ii) the development of physical models and their application to both the design of the experiment hardware and/or interpretation of flight data, and/or (iii) the analysis of science data taken by the parent mission.  An MO investigations may not wholly substitute for a Data Analysis program that comes more appropriately after data are placed in the archive.  In any event, MO investigations are generally conducted on a no-exchange-of-funds basis with the organization sponsoring the parent mission.	MO investigations may be approved through the New Frontiers Program when their perceived value is high and their proposed cost to NASA OSS is within the above funding limits. Participation in the New Frontiers program is open to all categories of organizations, foreign and domestic, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies.   NASA welcomes critical review and comment of this DRAFT AO, which will be available on or about April 30, 2003, through May 14, 2003, via the World Wide Web site:	http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/open.cfm  . Send comments to Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, Solar System Exploration Division, Code SE, Office of Space Science, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; FAX: (202) 358-3091; or E-mail: thomas.h.morgan@nasa.gov, with the subject line "NFAO".  The identities of those submitting comments will be held in confidence and will not be retained by NASA after the comment period activities are concluded.

<DESC>The Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA), Tyndall AFB FL, is seeking qualified firms (or joint ventures consisting of one lead firm, with other firms providing support) to provide architect-engineering services in support of Air Force Civil Engineering activities.  This engineering support includes cost engineering and analysis, facility design, economic studies, and utility systems revitalization and privatization.  The government contemplates the award of two (2) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the above A-E services in the Feb-Mar 2003 time frame.  Maximum fees for each of the two highest ranked firms is estimated to be $5 million for the basic year and $5 million for each of four (4) option years, or a total of $25 million for each A-E contract.  Individual task orders will not exceed $1 million.  Task orders will be issued on an "as required" basis.  The guaranteed minimum fee during the life of each contract is $100,000.  The work requires multidiscipline architectural and engineering services necessary for the preparation of technical and systems engineering documents supporting requirements worldwide.

Work also includes maintenance and enhancements to existing automated cost engineering systems called Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES) and Remedial Action Cost Engineering and Requirements (RACER) system; (3) Construction Supervision and Inspection (construction observation and inspection, review of submittals, site visits, consultation services during contractor preparation of operations and maintenance manuals and preparation of as-built drawings); (4) Planning Services (site utility, infrastructure, traffic and facility planning studies, and analyses); Base Plans (Customer Concept Documents (CCD), Requirements Documents (RD), Project Definition (PD), conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain data, and developing long-range/short-range base/facility development plans).  

Selection of firm/teams for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services described above.  Evaluation factors, in descending order of importance:  (1) professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of architect-engineering services described above; (2) recent specialized experience in the areas of architect-engineering described above by the professionally registered and qualified personnel who will perform the actual project work (including consultants); (3) capacity of the firm to perform the work in the time required at stateside and overseas locations; (4) past performance history on both DoD and other contracts in terms of quality of work, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules; (5) demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design; (6) volume of work awarded to the firm by the DoD in the last 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of A-E contracts among qualified firms; (7) extent of subcontracting to small businesses and small disadvantaged business, historically black colleges, and university, or minority institution performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  

No additional information will be given to A-E firms.  Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a letter of interest and three (3) copies each of completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255 to represent the firm/team.  Submission of office brochures is encouraged only to the extent that they graphically substantiate the work specifically described in the SF 254 and SF 255.  The submittal shall be limited to 150 pages including the letter of intent, SF 254, SF 255, and all attachments including any office brochures.  Not included in the page limitation are sectional dividers/tabs that are solely used to divide the submittal.  Any pages that exceed the limitation will not be evaluated.  Include the following statement in section 10, SF 255:  "This firm/joint venture has been awarded $XXX,XXX of DoD fees in the 12 months preceding the date of this SF 255."  

This is not a Request For Proposal.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541310 and 541330.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  Submittals must be received no later than 3:00 PM central time on 29 July 02. Submittals received after that date will not be considered.  Electronic or facsimile submittals will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Basic Research Laboratory  (BRL), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure record abstraction, data entry, and file development from the pilot study of the follow-up to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia with Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background: The Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the data entry of and file development from the pilot study of questionnaires and other data collection techniques in a high-risk population of mothers and children who participated in a birth study when the mothers suffered from preeclampsia during the index pregnancy in comparison with an age-matched set of normotensive controls (mothers and their offspring).  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to explore the biological mechanisms underlying why women who suffered from preeclampsia during pregnancy and their offspring are at significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (in mothers and daughters of that pregnancy) while the male offspring are at the lowest risk of prostate cancer identified in the literature.  The information collected during the pretest and pilot study will need to be keyed, entered, and developed in an analytic file to enable the investigators at NCI in collaboration with The Rogaland Hospital, Stavanger, Norway to compare the maternal and child responses to the pilot study forms and the anthropometric and pubertal stage data in mothers and their offspring from the preeclamptic pregnancy with mothers and offspring from the normotensive pregnancy and thereby develop the final forms for a follow-up of the total cohort with the ultimate goal of identifying hormonal and other mechanisms associated with the lowered cancer risk in this population.  Other information for the data file arise from anthropometric measurements of weight and of height taken when the children were one, two, three, and four years of age as part of the routine public health clinic visits.  This information in combination with the pilot data shall then form a profile of the growth data on the children. Dr. Lars Vatten was the primary author to the research based in the Rogaland Hospital in Stavanger, Norway of the population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  His analysis of the original birth study identified significant growth retardation in newborns of preeclamptic in contrast with newborns of normotensive mothers as well as hormonal differences in the cord blood of the offspring of the two pregnancies.  These hormones are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in animal models and in human epidemiologic research.  Public health nurses in Norway routinely measure weight and length in infancy and early childhood and record the data in a health record available for abstraction, after parental consent.  It is important to the NCI that an evaluation of the early childhood anthropometric data be (abstracted, coded, and) entered in a file to determine whether the offspring of preeclamptic pregnancies experienced catch-up in weight and/or height since birth; these results will have implications for the timing of the follow-up of the full study population.  It is also necessary to key, enter and analyze the data from the pretest and pilot forms and other tools for development of final forms for use in a follow-up of this population, when the offspring enter puberty and adolescence.  This is the only population-based study to date of preeclampsia and these women represent all women, who were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia in pregnancy in the birth years from 1993 through 1995 who resided in the Stavanger area in Norway.  The NCI has the opportunity to develop a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother's and biological father's families.  The pretest and pilot of this form in the mothers and the pretest of a brief questionnaire about physical activity in children aged 10 years shall provide data to examine whether NCI can expect differences in the children of the two pregnancies and thereby provide the rationale for the conduct of the follow-up.   Given the large sample size of 1,000 in the original birth study, there is the opportunity to have the statistical power to compute hormonal and other growth factor differences in the study population.   Contractor Requirements:  The Contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1) Obtain informed consent from a pilot study sample of mothers and offspring to abstract anthropometric data from the public health record, 2) Train a record abstractor to identify the appropriate anthropometric data from the public health record, 3) Key, (code when applicable), enter and develop a file of the abstracted anthropometric data from the public health records and pilot study data, including: a) Responses from the maternal questionnaire, b) Responses from the child's physical activity questionnaire, c) Weight and heights from the health record, d) Program and run descriptive statistics on the pilot and health record data and e) Perform analysis of the pilot study data comparing responses in mothers and offspring of the preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies. Period of Performance:  June 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003.  The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned requirements. The Investigator has been involved in the original birth study and has worked for many years with the Medical Director of The Rogaland Central Hospital.  Their insights from the original study as well as their scientific leadership in the area of preeclampsia provide extraordinary knowledge and experience in the Norwegian linked birth-cancer registry system, the public health record system, and in this particular study population.  They have worked with the study data sets over the years and can thereby lead a team in the data analysis of the pilot study and early childhood anthropometric data.  Therefore the background of the population, nature of its low risk for cancer, as well as the expertise and educational background of the Investigator and his team of data abstractors and analysts are all reasons for the sole source justification. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on May 14, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The information collected during the pretest and pilot shall enable the investigators at NCI in collaboration with the investigator and The Rogaland Hospital, Stavanger, Norway to develop a follow-up of the cohort with the ultimate goal of identifying hormonal and other mechanisms associated with the lowered cancer risk in this population.  They have conducted the only population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  The original birth study identified hormonal differences in the cord blood of the offspring of the preeclamptics versus the normotensive controls.  These hormones are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in animal models and in human epidemiologic research.  Nonetheless there are no data collected on a population such as this following birth till the age at diagnosis of adult cancer.  It is our intent then to pretest and pilot forms and other tools for use in a follow-up of this population as the offspring enter puberty and adolescence, when hormonal and other growth factors might differ appreciably from children of normotensive pregnancies.  This is the only population-based study to date of preeclampsia and these women represent all women, who were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia in the birth years from 1993 through 1995 who resided in Stavanger Province, Norway and who delivered a live birth.  The birth study utilized data from the birth registry in Norway and stored cord bloods to demonstrate hormonal and anthropometric differences in the offspring of the preeclamptic and normotensive mothers.  The NCI has the opportunity to develop a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother's and biological father's families.  The pretest and pilot of this form in the mothers and the pretest of a brief questionnaire about physical activity in children aged 10 years shall provide valuable feedback to the study team for the conduct of the follow-up.   Given the large sample size of 1,000 in the original birth study, there is the opportunity to have the statistical power to compute hormonal and other growth factor differences in the formal follow-up study population.  Contractor Requirements: The Contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1) Select a sample for the pilot study from among the original study population; 2) Send invitation letters to the pilot study group, 3) Pretest and pilot all study forms, including: a) The maternal questionnaire, b) The child's physical activity questionnaire, c) Identify the optimal times to travel mothers and children to the hospital for a pilot study, e) Complete a clinical evaluation of the pubertal stage and anthropometric status of the children, f) Identify whether mothers and children are willing to have blood drawn for hormone assays and whether the children are willing to wear pedometers, g) Compare assessments by two different pediatricians of the pubertal staging in a small subsample of children and,  h) Identify any problems in forms and other data collection techniques. Rogaland Hospital shall perform the pilot study, develop a qualitative description summarizing any problems in logistics and conduct of the pilot study, and submit the summary to the government.  None of this information will include personal identifiers.  Period of Performance:  June 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003.  Rogaland Central Hospital is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned requirements.  The Rogaland Hospital has as its director, the original Principal Investigator to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia, who has had direct contact with all the families involved in the original study, thereby having credibility and links to the study population of interest.  The efforts and insights from the original study as well as the leadership position at the hospital provide extraordinary opportunity and support for the conduct of this pretest and pilot.  The training in obstetrics and gynecology along with the experience of the Pediatric Department in adolescent medicine has given the team the knowledge and background to conduct the pilot.  Therefore the background of the population, nature of its low risk for cancer, as well as the expertise and educational background of the original principal investigator and his team are all reasons for the sole source justification.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. NCI-RFQ-30042-NV will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2001-13.  It is anticipated that two awards will be made from this solicitation.  

The North American Industrial Code is 541380 and the business size standard is 6M.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses. 

Background:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) proposes to enter into a agreement  with two laboratories to use serological methods to study the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) in non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), in a study entitled, SV40 and non-Hodgkins lymphoma: a case control study. 

SV40 was an inadvertent contaminant of poliovirus vaccines widely administered in 1955-62 in the U.S. Of concern, SV40 causes a variety of tumors when injected into newborn laboratory animals, including brain tumors, mesotheliomas, osteosarcomas, and notably, NHL. The possibility that SV40 infections, arising through vaccinations or other routes, cause a substantial fraction of NHLs was recently raised by two U.S. reports, describing the detection of SV40 DNA in 33-50% of NHLs (1,2).

Recent work has demonstrated the value of virus-like particle (VLP) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of SV40 infection in humans. Specifically, a recent publication documented the sensitivity and specificity of an SV40 VLP assay for detection of SV40 infection (3). The EIA format is particularly appropriate for epidemiological studies, since it can be performed inexpensively on a large scale, using small volumes of sera. Similar VLP EIAs for the human polyomaviruses BK and JC allow for the evaluation of cross-reactive antibodies in the same serum samples. An SV40 VLP EIA was used in a study of NHL in Spain (4).

NCI will study the association between SV40 and NHL, by measuring SV40 antibodies in subjects from the NCI-SEER Case-Control Study of NHL. This case-control study includes serum on approximately 800 HIV-uninfected NHL cases and 700 age-matched HIV-uninfected population controls. This study will be the first U.S. population-based case-control study of SV40 and NHL. NCI proposes to perform this testing using VLP EIAs for SV40, BK, and JC viruses. NCI seeks two independent laboratories to perform this testing, in order to compare the consistency of results between laboratories.

Base Requirement:

The purpose of this study is to compare SV40 antibody prevalence in NHL cases and controls. 

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, materials, and facilities as needed to perform this requirement.  Serum samples will be supplied by the NCI.

Contract Requirements:

1. The contractor shall perform VLP enzyme immunoassay measurements on 1500 serum samples from NHL cases and control. The contractor will perform VLP measurements separately for the three polyomaviruses SV40, BK, and JC. All samples will be tested in duplicate, and samples demonstrating coefficients of variation greater than 20% will be repeated. 
2. The contractor shall send to NCI the results of these tests in electronic format (Excel file or text file), along with the results of negative and positive controls from the corresponding assay runs. Results will consist of the individual optical density readings from the enzyme immunoassay runs and a score of each result as positive or negative.
3. The contractor shall send an invoice to NCI, specifying the samples tested and tests performed.

<DESC>CMS is in the process of issuing a Competitive 8(a) RFP using the Advisory Multi-step process to make the award.  Interested offerors are invited to submit information that CMS will evaluate to determine which sources appear to be the most viable competitors.  

Background:
The Office of Information Services (OIS) is charged with the support and management of information systems architecture, assets (hardware, software and resources), enterprise databases, accesses to data, and operational systems for the Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS). 

CMS is responsible for, and retains stewardship of, a vast quantity of Medicare and Medicaid data assets. This data contains detailed information on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and their associated claims, diagnostic, and treatment information.  The current amount of data under management is approximately 40 Terabytes, with an anticipated growth of rate of 10% to 20% per year. This amount of data places CMS as one of the larger data repositories in the United States, and brings with it the complexities of managing repositories of this size. Additionally, CMS has the often-conflicting responsibility of making this valuable information available to the public, research organizations, universities, and congressional members and committees, while protecting the privacy of the recipient beneficiaries. To support these requirements, CMS must develop a progressive and modern database architecture that enables management and access to the data, while providing the capability to protect beneficiary privacy.

The Division of Data Management Standards & Services (DDMSS) is charged with providing highly skilled data and database administrators to assist in the development, implementation, maintenance, and ongoing support of the agencys operational and enterprise relational database management systems. We face unique challenges due to the diversity of our user community as well as the technologies deployed.  Currently, DDMSS provides Data Administrator (DA) and Database Administrator (DBA) support for applications targeted for a variety of RDBMS platforms, including IBM DB2 on the mainframe; Oracle on WIN2K, AIX, and Solaris; and Microsoft SQL Server on WIN2K.  The databases for these systems are far ranging in complexity and size.  Some databases have more than 300 tables; others employ less than a dozen.  Some databases are as small as a few dozen megabytes in size; others span up to 10 terabytes.  CMS has databases deployed on mainframes, mid tier servers, and at Internet Service Providers.

Submission Requirements:
1.  Describe the specific challenges associated with architecting and providing both DA and DBA support for Operational Data Store (ODS) systems, Decision Support Systems (DSS), and Data Warehouse (DW) systems.
2.  Compare and contrast the roles of Data Administrator and Database Administrator, particularly in the way your company has defined these roles.
3.  Provide a copy of your corporate DA standard operating procedures, standards, and guidelines.
4.  Provide a copy of your corporate DBA standard operating procedures, standards, and guidelines for:
a.  DB2
b.  Oracle
c.  SQL Server
5.  Describe in detail the specific challenges associated with architecting, building, and maintaining Very Large Databases (VLDBs) and Very Large Data Warehouses (VLDWs).
6.  Provide a diagram depicting your corporations vision of an enterprise metadata architecture.

CMS will evaluate the above information to evaluate comprehension of the subject matter and maturity of the current corporate practices in place.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to secure a complete set of services that have historically been accomplished by numerous individual contracts.  Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, and services to construct modified fuel profile zones, treat and remove products, treat miscellaneous noxious weed/plants, treat riparian reserves and reduce fuels during the period of July 2003 to November 1, 2004 on the Weaverville Ranger District, Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Trinity County, California.  In the past, contracts have been awarded for logging, fuel reduction, wildlife enhancement and stream channel protection/enhancement in the same general area.  Each of these was designed to meet the management objectives for a narrow range of resources.  Fuel reduction was for fire management and silviculture goals; logging was for timber and fire management goals, wildlife enhancement for recruiting wildlife habitat and soils concerns: and stream channel protection/enhancement was for fishery, soils, and hydrology goals.  This contract combines all of these operations into one contract to take advantage of the efficiencies of having one larger operation to meet multiple objectives.  Approximately 630 acres in one bid item will be treated with a combination of the following treatments.  Work consists of product treatment and removal (logging by helicopter and ground-based equipment), hand cutting live, dead and damaged vegetation, riparian reserve hand piling/burning, grapple piling, lopping and scattering, mastication, hand piling whole units, and fireline construction.  Estimated start work date is July 2003 with a contract time of 2 years.  There will be a pre-bid tour; date and time will be announced in the solicitation.  Solicitation will be a Request for Proposal with the evaluation criteria clearly identified in Section M.  Solicitation documents will be available for downloading off this website on or about May 13, 2003.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Dr. Sherif Ismail, Executive Deputy Chairman, Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company (Echem), 3 El Mokhayam El Dayem Street, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone: (20-2) 263-4000, Fax:  (20-2) 263-1010  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for a proposed linear alkyl benzene (LAB) facility in Egypt.

The Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company (Echem) was established in February 2002 by the Ministry of Petroleum to manage existing publicly held assets and equities in the chemical/petrochemical industry.  Echem is mandated to identify and develop new petrochemical and chemical production opportunities in cooperation with its sister parastatal organizations such as the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the Egyptian Gas Holding Company, as well as private companies and investors.

LAB is a preferred petrochemical feedstock for synthetic detergents used in both domestic and industrial applications because of its low cost, optimal detergent properties, and a demonstrated biodegradability in all uses.  The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum has forty years of experience producing detergent feedstocks dodecylbenzene (DDB) and LAB with EGPC being a dependable supplier of quality LAB product through its 40 kilotons-per-annum (kta) plant at Amerya.  A preliminary investigation performed by Echem in 2002 found that the Normal Paraffins (NP) and LAB markets indicate a growth in demand for LAB, as do the ongoing negotiations with both the local and global users of LAB.  With the economic success of the existing EGPC LAB facility in Amerya, Echem believes the economic indicators for a new LAB plant in Alexandria that would produce 80 kta are encouraging.

Echems objective is to build a petrochemical plant capable of producing 80,000 metric tons per annum (mta) of LAB while maximizing the reuse of existing utilities, and general facilities at the potential site.  The current Egyptian total domestic consumption of LAB is 50,000 mta, which is met by domestic production.  By the year 2006, Echem expects that the domestic consumption will increase to 70,000 mta.  The proposed 80,000 mta plant would increase Egypts total LAB domestic production to 130,000 mta.  Echem plans to export its surplus production to buyers in Europe and/or the Middle East.

The objective of the study is to investigate the technical, economic and marketing feasibility of manufacturing 80,000 mta of LAB based on NPs.  The tasks for the study  are summarized as follows:

Task A:  Feedstock Assessment
Task B:  Marketing Assessment
Task C:  Technology and Technical Evaluation
Task D:  Existing Refinery Integration
Task E:  Preliminary Environmental, Health and Safety Assessment
Task F:  Project Cost Estimation
Task G:  Financial Analysis
Task H:  Business Briefing
Task I:    Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $756,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local Egyptian time on Monday, May 12, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the current level of effort under Contract PBGC01-CT-02-0630.  The contract includes the analysis, development and maintenance programming of approximately 16 PBGC custom-designed software applications.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider.  The increase in the level of effort for just the current fiscal year of 2003 is to accommodate the increase in workload resulting from the upcoming trusteeship of a significant pension plan and provide support for software applications maintained by this contract, in support of corporate infrastructure changes and upgrades.  These additional activities are likely to place unforeseen demands on the efficiency and responsiveness of PBGC systems.  In view of the providers familiarity with the complexities of PBGC, extensive systems experience with PBGCs environment, and the time already spent in learning the work and PBGC policies and procedures, it is PBGCs belief that it would be in our best interest for the current provider to continue performing the work under the contract.  All responsible sources may submit their capabilities which will be considered by the agency in accordance with Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii)  Solicitation F0260103Q0144 is being issued as a request for quotation.  (iii)  This solicitation incorporates clauses and provisions in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13.  (iv)  This requirement is being synopsized as a small business set-aside under standard industrial classification code 4959, NAICS code 562910, small business size standard of 500 employees.  (v)  CLIN one is for services listed in vi.  (vi)  Please propose for the following services:  1.  Furnish all management, supervision, labor, tools, transportation, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary to conduct site characterization at former underground storage tank (UST) locations at the Army and Air Force Exchange (AAFES) service station, building 2513.  The site characterization should define the extent of vertical soil contamination in accordance with Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) requirements.  2.  Review documents from a previous site investigation to further define contamination from Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST).  The Contractor must be an ADEQ pre-qualified consultant for site characterization work. Perform the site assessments and assemble the lab sample analysis in a report that meets the LUST case closure regulations.  3.  In January 2003, four 10,000 gallon underground storage tanks and associated dispensers were excavated and removed from building 2513. An initial assessment report is available for review.  Results of the initial assessment indicates total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) soil contamination determined using Arizona Department of Environmental Quality methods 8260 and 8310, extending to a depth of at least 14 feet below grade surface (bgs) at the UST locations and two to three feet bgs at pipeline and dispenser locations.  The total vertical and lateral extent of TPH soil contamination was not determined during the initial assessment.  Sampling for lateral extent soil contamination is not required because soil analysis shows contamination well below the Residential Soil Remediation Standards.  4.  The purpose of this project is to delineate the vertical limits of detectable soil contamination. The Contractor shall provide a mobile lab and qualified personnel to screen for petroleum contamination who shall be on site and responsible for all soil boring and sampling activities.  5.  The Contractor shall drill five (5) soil borings.  These borings shall be drilled to a depth of 25 feet below grade (bg) or 10 feet below grade based on the grade of the last field-detected contamination.  Placement of borings should be determined based on information in the initial assessment report and as required by the ADEQ follow-up report.  Borings may have to be extended if field observations detect contamination.  The Contractor will not drill beyond a depth of 25 feet unless given approval by the Government representative.  All borings are to be backfilled with fresh soil by the Contractor.
Bore 1: Lust File# 0128.33  Former UST #3, bore to 25 feet bgs
Bore 2: Lust File# 0128.34  Dispenser #1, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 3: Lust File# 0128.35  Dispenser #2, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 4: Lust File# 0128.36  Dispenser #4, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 5: Lust File# 0128.37  Product line/ elbow #8, bore to 10 ft bgs. 
6.  Sample Collection: All samples will be field-screened for the presence of organic vapors.  Samples will be collected in accordance with Arizona Administrative Code for UST Closure.  7.  Sample Analysis: A total of five (5) soil samples will be submitted to an Arizona state-certified laboratory and analyzed for the presence of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons using ADEQ method 8310 for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and method 8260 for volatile organic compounds (VOC).  If initial borings show field detection, then the borings will extend in 5 foot increments until no detection, for example, 10, 15, 20, and 25 feet bg.  If borings are drilled beyond 25 feet bg, the contracting officer representative will determine which samples are to be analyzed based upon boring logs and field organic vapor readings, and if any additional samples are necessary.  8.  Prepare and submit required reports to Base Environmental Flight, 355 CES/CEV.  The reports shall be submitted in draft form for review, and revisions made as directed by the Government representative.  All reports shall be prepared in accordance with ADEQ Guidance Document "LUST Site Characterization Report Checklist".  9.  Sample and analyze for contamination in accordance with ADEQ case closure procedures.  Sampling will be done to a depth of no detection of contamination.  Upon completion of all site activities, return the site to pre-construction condition.  Submit a Site Closure Report within twenty one (21) calendar days of completing all fieldwork and receipt of all analytical results.  Ensure the report meets the standards set forth in the Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) R18-12-263.03 (D).  10.  Soil cuttings are to be placed in 55-gallon drums (provided by the Contractor) and labeled with the boring numbers and depth intervals.  The Government will dispose of filled drums.  The Contractor will dispose of rinsate off base in accordance with all Federal, State, and/or local regulations.  Following completion of the project, any trash, debris, and excess grout generated by the project is to be removed by the Contractor.  11.  Obtain all necessary Federal, State and/or local environmental permits, licenses and/or certificates required to perform and complete the work.  Documentation shall be available for Government inspection.  12.  Attend a pre-construction conference before the start of fieldwork.  A work plan defining the Contractor's proposed methods to accomplish all fieldwork shall be submitted to the Government a minimum of two weeks before initiation of fieldwork.  This plan shall include at a minimum, the Contractor's methods, equipment, and procedures for carrying out all fieldwork including drilling, soil sampling, and decontamination procedures.  13.  All activities shall be conducted in compliance with all Federal, State and local environmental laws, statutes and regulations.  14.  Complete all work within thirty (30) days after pre-performance conference.  15.  A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the 355th Contracting Squadron, 3180 S.

It is anticipated that a solicitation for this project will be issued and awarded this winter; work is tentatively scheduled to begin July 7, 2003. Contract duration will be 75 days. The estimated dollar range for the project is $250,000 to $500,000. Note: another Notice will be posted prior to issuance of the actual solicitation.

<DESC>Amendment 0001- This Amendment hereby replaces the original synopsis in its entirety and incorporates the following synopsis as follows:  

This is a Request For Information (RFI) and not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this document is to request information supporting the acquisition of services to perform the Integrated Logistics Overhaul of Fleet Hospitals.  The Government seeks feedback from interested parties in order to reduce probable future questions and/or misunderstandings that may result from the Performance Work Statement of this acquisition.  This is a request for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  All data received in response to this notice will be fully protected from release outside the Government.  Information provided herein is subject to change.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or make an award in response to this Synopsis.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Website, located at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk is seeking sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform a contract in support of the Fleet Hospital Support Office (FHSO) for logistics support services.  Performance will be predominantly in Williamsburg, VA.  The Fleet Hospital is comprised of nine Fleet Hospitals around the world, which are overhauled during a 3-5 year maintenance cycle called the Integrated Logistics Overhaul.  Throughout the ILO process, the assets are downloaded; its materials, equipment, shelters, and containers are inspected; damaged or obsolete material is repaired/upgraded/replaced; all required items are then reloaded into the specified storage asset; and finally the hospital is prepared for shipment back to a pre-positioned location.  

The Contractor is to perform the Integrated Logistics Overhaul of Fleet Hospitals, or segments thereof, concurrently with related support functions in warehousing; inventory control; inspection, test, minor preventive maintenance, and repair of Fleet Hospital biomedical equipment; inspection and minor maintenance adjustments to Civil Engineering Support Equipment (CESE); and inspection and repair of configured shelters and transportation functions.  The Contractor shall perform all aspects of the ILO from the arrival of a Fleet Hospital at FHSO through its final preparation for re-deployment.  

Interested parties shall download and review the attached Performance Work Statement for this acquisition and answer the Governments following questions.  The Government is interested in receiving answers to the following questions: 1) Does the Performance Work Statement (PWS) effectively communicate the tasks required?  If not, what specific areas are questionable or unclear? and 2) Do you have any comments or recommendations in regards to the content of the PWS as to whether you agree or disagree it clearly communicates the requirement?  
 
Depending on the information gathered from this announcement, the Government intends to solicit competitive proposals for an Indefinite Delivery Requirements, Time and Materials (T&M) / Firm Fixed Price hybrid, Performance Based type contract for the above services to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government, cost and non-cost factors considered.  The contract will cover a period of five years comprised of one base year and four one-year options.  

All responses to this Request For Information notice shall be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on 2 May 2003.  Offerors shall either mail their responses to the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), 1968 Gilbert Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA 23511-3392, Attn: Cheryl Bernhard, Code 203B4, Reference FHSO Request For Information (OR) email responses to Cheryl Bernhard.

<DESC>Objectives.  The project objectives are to provide an analysis of the fire effects on the petroglyph sandstone and the natural rock coatings (varnish and oxalate).  The project will assess the effects of the fire on the materials in the rock coatings that are used to date the petroglyphs.  The project will also assess the need for conservation measures because of the alteration of the sandstone and the deposition of foreign materials by the fire and flood water. (1).  The contractor will conduct analyses to test the dating of the petroglyphs and will assess if the carbon in and under the rock coating has been contaminated because of the fire.  The contractor will assess if cations in the varnish that are used to date petroglyphs were altered by the fire.  The methods used will be microlamination analysis, carbon and oxalate analysis and dating, and cation-ratio calculations.  (2).  The contractor will conduct analyses to assess if the fire and flash flood foreign material deposits on the rock art are damaging the glyphs and should be removed by a conservator.  The contractor will conduct an analysis of the sandstone quartz grains to assess whether they may have been altered by the fire and will consequently present conservation problems for the petroglyphs.  The methods used will be Backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) and Wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS), Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP), and Transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM). Analyses.  Standard laboratories will be used for analyses such as radiocarbon and oxalate isotopes.  The contractor will collect the samples appropriate for the analyses and conduct the laboratory analyses.  The analyses planned are the following: Analysis							Number planned Microlamination analysis						4 Radiocarbon dating (C14) on oxalates				4 Stable carbon of oxalate (13 C)					2 Radiocarbon dating (C14) of organic carbon				5 Cation-ratio calculation						14 Backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) and 	Wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)			4 Transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM)			4 Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP)		4 In sampling, the best attempt is made to collect the necessary materials for each study.  However, for some analyses we cannot know if the required material is present until after laboratory work begins on the sample.  For example, we may collect a sample for radiocarbon analysis, but may find inadequate carbon is present.  In that event we would have incurred the cost for the laboratory processing, but would not have the radiocarbon dating cost.  However, the sample may be appropriate for another kind of analysis and we may use it for that instead.  For example, we may not have adequate carbon present, but the sample may have good varnish for cation-ratio analysis.  In addition, the outcome of the initial analyses may indicate that the initial plan should be changed to focus attention on one kind of analysis over another.  In consequence, it may be necessary to conduct a different number of each kind of laboratory analysis than originally planned.  We may shift funding between these types of analyses and do more of one kind and less of another compared with the proposed pre-work plan above.  The contractor shall perform the laboratory analyses and provide a preliminary report listing the results of the analyses. After all the analyses have been completed, the contractor shall provide a final report discussing the results of the analyses. Preliminary reports will be sent to the BLM following the completion of different kinds of analysis.  The first preliminary report will be due on September 30, 2004.  The final report will be due on September 30, 2005.

Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to determine which prospective prime contractors will be granted access to additional intelligence information at the Joint Service/DOD level.  This additional information is restricted to U.S. companies only and is necessary to submit a proposal in response to the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SLAMRAAM procurement.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. -- DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:  The SLAMRAAM System includes a fire unit using a HMMWV/Army common carrier, the USAF AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, GPS receiver, land navigation system, EPLRS/SINCGARS radios, FBCB2; Sentinel ETRAC and JLENS sensors; and an integrat ed fire control station (IFCS). The IFC capability will be developed using maturing BMC4I technologies, will integrate sensor data, engagement operations, and force operations, and is to be the initial fielded capability for the Air and Missile Defense Tac tical Operations Center. -- CONCEPT PAPER:  The contractor is requested to submit a concept paper (not to exceed 10 pages in length) that addresses the contractors experience in developing and producing major systems, either for the military or commercial sector, at a level of compl exity similar to the SLAMRAAM development effort described below.  The contractor should present an overview of its initial concept for meeting the requirements for a SLAMRAAM system as described in draft SOW and System and Launcher Specification documents , which can be found at the SLAMRAAM Industry Website (see instructions below for requesting website access).  The concept paper should focus on the contractors concept for Integrated Fire Control, first for the SLAMRAAM system, and second as a building b lock toward a common AMD TOC for Patriot, MEADS, and JLENS.

The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.    
 
B--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1)	Technical Description:  AFRL/MNA is conducting the 12-month Tunnel Defeat (TD) program that intends to design, develop, and characterize a guidance algorithm that will allow multiple air-to-ground delivered munitions to arrive at one or more pre-planned aimpoints, both precisely and simultaneously.  The desired end result is to cause the multiple warheads to act as one large explosive charge by detonating the independent, closely spaced warheads simultaneously.  The warheads must therefore be closely spaced in order that the individual blast waves and warhead detonation will be triggered electronically prior to impact. The program is divided into four tasks; however, this is not a task order or IDIQ contract.  Task I: Concept Definition/Detailed Design, Task II: SimulationSensitivity/Monte Carlo Analyses, Task III: Airframe Requirements Study, and Task IV: Weapon Integration and Test Plan.

MINIMUM TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS: 

The guidance design shall describe a system capable of enabling discrete air-delivered munitions to manage free-fall energy in order to arrive precisely at a predetermined point and time.  The goal is to be able to place multiple weapons (up to six) within a 10-meter diameter sphere centered at the aimpoint at the time of detonation (assumed simultaneous), with weapons nominally released from 30k ft at M0.8.  The separation in weapon release times must also be considered, since all weapons will not be released simultaneously.  The goal of this program is to be able to support a minimum 15-second separation between release of the first and last weapons, with an objective of 30 seconds separation.  The Offeror shall conduct detailed sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo analyses of its guidance design.  It is highly desirable that the precision time-of-arrival (PTOA) guidance design be compatible with existing or modified guidance kit hardware.   The baseline warhead is the 2000# MK-84 general purpose warhead or the similar composite blast bomb.  (See Section C7)  Mass properties and dimensions for these weapons shall be provided as GFI to the contractor.  The Offeror shall recommend an airframe (tailkit) and integration approach as part of the integration and test plan, Task IV.  The Offeror shall accomplish the following specific design, development, and study requirements:

CONCEPT DEFINITION/DETAILED DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT (TASK I):  The Offeror shall develop a system concept and then design and develop detailed guidance algorithm.  The guidance algorithm shall be integrated in a 6 degree of freedom (6DOF) simulation, to include required airframe and navigation characteristics.  The guidance law shall be demonstrated in the 6DOF simulation.  The Offeror shall identify assumptions and limitations that characterize the system concept, airframe and guidance law.  The Government shall participate in all design reviews and to the extent possible, and at the discretion of the Offeror, in the design and development process.

SIMULATIONSSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS/MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS (TASK II): The Offeror shall demonstrate the robustness of the guidance law.  The Offeror shall take the guidance design from Task I and fully develop and define its capabilities through iterative simulation runs, sensitivity analyses, and Monte Carlo analyses.  The simulations shall include detailed system error characteristics such as aircraft initialization errors, variations in weapon release, navigation and control errors, and wind models.

AIRFRAME REQUIREMENTS STUDY (TASK III): The Offeror shall assess the potential of existing guidance kits and modifications to existing guidance kits, to support the guidance law to common, existing tailkits.  If no existing tailkits offer sufficient energy control, then the Offeror shall design the hardware components necessary for the successful achievement of the stated objectives.  The design need not include detailed drawings or in-depth structural/aerodynamic analyses, but should adequately describe the proposed weapon system and its intended performance characteristics.

INTEGRATION and FLIGHT TEST PLAN (TASK IV): The Offeror shall develop an integration and flight test plan for a potential follow-on program.  The test will demonstrate the integration of the guidance algorithm, the airframe defined in Task III, and the baseline warhead.  As part of the integration effort, the Offeror shall present a detailed plan to show his/her approach for integrating the guidance algorithm, the airframe and the baseline warhead.  A comprehensive test plan shall be developed, to include both ground and limited free-flight testing to demonstrate the capability of the airframe/guidance to put a weapon on target with a precise time of arrival.  At a minimum, the tests outlined in Test Plan Execution (Option I) shall be addressed.  The above Tasks I-IV requirements have been established as an initial baseline and may be changed during the program with Government direction/approval.

TEST PLAN EXECUTION (OPTIONAL TASK V): The Offeror shall implement the integration and flight test plan defined as part of Task IV.  A flight demonstration phase is envisioned in order to demonstrate the capability to precisely control the time of arrival of weapons.  The demonstration would consist of at least three inert weapon drop tests, with four weapons dropped.  

(1) The first test will consist of a single weapon drop.  The intent will be to demonstrate PTOA capability under near optimum release conditions.  In this case, the arrival time may be pre-planned.  

(2) The second flight test will again consist of a single weapon drop.  The intent in this test will be to expand the release envelope beyond that of test 1.  This may require the weapon to simulate a 15- to 30-second release separation.  In this test, the arrival time will be selected in real-time.

(3) The final flight test will consist of a 2-weapon ripple release.  The intent here will be to demonstrate capability to put 2 weapons at selected locations and at the same time.  The arrival time will be computed in real-time and also provided to the weapons in real-time.

E--PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  

The selection of none, one, or more sources for contract award shall be based on scientific and engineering evaluation of the proposals in response to this PRDA to determine best-value to the Government for the entire program.  Proposals will be evaluated using the factors given below.  The factors, listed in descending order of importance, are: (1) The overall technical merits of the proposal, including technical approach, and program management, (2) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the program objectives, (3) The Offerors capability to support potential weapon integration and flight testing of the proposed weapon system, to include the developed guidance, (4)  Reasonableness and realism of proposed schedule and cost:  (5) The Offeror's record of recent past relevant performance.  An evaluation is made of all proposed costs to ensure the Offeror has a proper understanding of the effort.  It is the policy of AFRL/MN to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Offeror must indicate on the appropriate page any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. 

In accordance with PRDA guidelines, the technical evaluation will rank proposals into three categories defined as follows:  Category I:  Category I proposals must be well-conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results.  Category I proposals are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally will be displaced only by other Category I proposals.  Category II: Category II proposals are scientifically or technically sound but may require further development. They can be recommended for acceptance, but are a lower priority than Category I.   Proposals in this category are not usually funded.  Category III:  Category III proposals are not technically sound or do not meet agency needs.  They are not recommended for award.  

The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.   The U.S. Air Force reserves the right to select for award one, several, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Offerors may contact the individuals or sections listed herein to obtain generally available clarification of technical/contractual issues and cost proposal format or pricing information.
