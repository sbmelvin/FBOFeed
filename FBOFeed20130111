However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Office of Translational Research, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with In Vitro Strategies, LLC, located at 1 Newell Road, Flemington, NJ 08822, for the modification of an existing purchase order to add additional hours of consulting services.<br /><br />In 2010, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research established a new model for drug development - a network that integrates industry drug development expertise with the innovative disease biology of NIH-funded research. This created the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) at NINDS. The BPN launched multiple projects in 2011 with senior-level, industry-experienced drug development consultants who help to develop promising new drug compounds at the NIH. The consulting individuals or companies that were awarded Purchase Orders are required to design and direct the drug development plan on BPN projects with NIH Principal Investigators. In addition, work requirements include possibly being required to provide guidance on other NIH neuroscience-focused drug development programs.<br /><br />In Vitro Strategies, LLC is a drug development consulting company that was issued a Purchase Order to provide expert consulting guidance on NIH Blueprint projects involved in the bioactivity assay area. The Purchase Order was awarded on June 11, 2011 for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year optional periods (PO#HHSN271201100387P). There is a need for additional services due to the increase of guidance required by the consultant in the BPN projects and other NIH programs focused on medicinal chemistry.<br /><br />These additional hours include profiling bioactivity assay issues on all BPN-funded projects. In the next period of performance, an additional 100 hours is required for consulting services, with an option to exercise four (4) additional 50-hour optional quantities. In the two option year periods of performance following, an additional 100 hours will be added to the base amounts, with an option to exercise six (6) additional 50-hour optional quantities in each performance period. <br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the competition requirements of Part 6. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />Comments to this announcement, referencing this synopsis number, may be submitted to the NIDA SS/SA Branch, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Hunter A. Tjugum, at tjugumha@mail.nih.gov.

The Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD) light duty test cell A005 is being rebuilt with a new four wheel drive chassis dynamometer.  The gas sampling equipment that was removed before construction is aging and many components are not available for replacement when problems arise.  Components of the Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) are not suitable to be upgraded to current testing criteria.  The EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Michigan utilizes the CVS system as a means for test sequencing, control, and exhaust sampling.     This upgrade shall replace aging CVS equipment currently at the EPA Facility that is capable of running vehicle tests under the requirements of the proposed amendments of 40 CFR part 1066.  The aging system currently only has a single sample path and pump with a motor controlled butterfly valve to control tail pipe back pressure.  

The CVS system upgrade will provide dilution of emissions via a common dilution tunnel six inches in diameter for both gasoline and diesel powered vehicles.  The system must be capable of sampling both bag and dilute continuous exhaust samples from both gasoline and diesel catalyst equipped vehicles.  The system will be made capable of raw gas sampling and ready for future installation of a compatible raw analysis bench including CDTCS integration.  The CVS equipment should be compatible with an existing dynamometer with current video driver?s aid and existing benches to assure test control and functionality.  For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, warranty, and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement trace ability and system acceptanc e in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards.
 This procurement will be accomplished unsing FAR Part 15 Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:dshannon@usgs.gov">dshannon@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in chartering an offshore research vessel (oceanographic research vessel) capable of working in broken sea ice to support a walrus radio-tagging project in the northern Chukchi Sea for a maximum of 14 days between July 11  and 25 2013.  Actual trip timing and length will depend on the weather and sea ice and the billing will reflect actual charter days.  The work area will be the northeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  The vessel will support two workboats in performing the science mission: One workboat will be outfitted and provided by USGS (USGS owned and equipped workboat) and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  A second (similarly outfitted) workboat will be provided by the contractor.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, or other appropriate port near the target field work, board the science crew, and continue to the work area for arrival to the work area by about July 14, 2013.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be 150 nautical miles west of Barrow, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO15), Leavenworth, KS, intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the NCO15 area which includes the States of Kansas, Missouri, a portion of Southern Illinois, and small sections of Indiana and Kentucky in the Tri-State area (see map:  http://www.visn15.va.gov/v15/sites_cboc_map.asp) to provide Community Nursing Home services at contractor's facilities under Basic Ordering Agreements.  

The VA anticipates issuing an open-continuous solicitation for this requirement on or about January 31, 2013. Proposals will be accepted throughout the one-year period commencing with the issuance date of the solicitation. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective Offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.  Proposals will be downloaded and evaluated for award on a periodic basis beginning within 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.  

In accordance with FAR  52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, VetBiz Registration, prospective contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and in VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov  and Vet Biz information at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM  website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays so they may be considered for a contract award. 

NAICS Code is 623110 (Nursing Care Facilities) with a small business size standard of $25.5M.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition.  Multiple awards are anticipated and will be made on an as needed basis. All responsible sources may submit proposals which may be considered by the Agency. 

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are licensed by their respective States and who are Medicare/Medicaid qualified.

Awards to responsive and responsible offerors will be made on the basis of best value to the Government using the following criteria:

"	Assessment of need with consideration of relevant veteran population in specific areas and number of existing Agreements already serving those areas..
"	Distance of contract facility from area of consideration
"	Number of available beds
"	Nursing Home Compare rating of Average (3 stars) in each of the three areas of review
"	Current State License
"	Prospective Contractor must have current registration in System For Award Management (SAM).
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award
"	Prospective Contractor must submit a completed VA Form 10-1170, "Application for Furnishing Long-Term Care" prior to consideration for award.
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA exclusion review (fire safety, general safety, and compliance review conducted by VA personnel) prior to award

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.  However, based on a typical usage rate of 1 veteran for 365 days, a reasonable estimate for the value of any particular contract would be around $50,000 per year, with many facilities experiencing authorized veteran populations in excess of 15 per year.  Daily rates differ depending on case mix and location.  

Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to dennis.putman@va.gov  and ensure that the subject line includes: solicitation # VA255-13-R-0375 and reference the site location if applicable.

4.  Statutory Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.   

5. Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed source is Immixtechnology, Inc., 8444 West Park Drive, Suite 200, McLean, VA 22102-5112.  The VETSNET application suite software is currently designed using the Code-1 software application-programming interface (API).  To use another, different version of the software would require a redesign/rewrite of the software suite.  This universal coding software provides addressing validation, correction, and standardization technologies for the United States and other countries.  This software will ensure data quality in real-time for the VETSNET application.  The universal coding software is provided by the United States Postal System through licensing and distribution via Pitney Bowes Software Inc. (PBSI).  The software is proprietary property of PBSI.  PBSI is the owner, developer and manufacturer of the source code to the software and has exclusive rights to distribute the software or authorize resellers.  PBSI's sole reseller of the software is Immixtechnology, Inc.  No other vendor has end user distribution rights to the source code.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  In accordance with FAR 8.405-6 and FAR 5.3, the delivery order will be synopsized and this Justification and Approval (J&A) will be made publicly available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  PBSI owns the rights to the universal coding software and only has one authorized reseller.  For future procurements, this agency will work with the program office to perform ongoing market research to identify any alternative solutions that may become available.    

8.  Market Research:    REDACTED

9.  Other facts:  None.

<DESC>TITLE: Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) Follow-On Contract Sources Sought/Capability Request for Information
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR QUOTE. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respones to this RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation. It is the intent of the Contracting Office to use the information collected for market research purposes only. If a formal solicitation is released, it will be via the Federal Business Oppertunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information. Only responses from US companies will be accepted. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Engine CIP is a program that establishes a prioritized list of projects each calendar year for engineering and test support as defined and agreed to by the Major Commands (MAJCOMs). Projects include developing engineering changes to the engines, developing organizational, intermediate and depot level repairs as needed, and designing modifications to existing support equipment as well as initiating new support equipment designs as required by engine driven changes. CIP also provides support to resolve service revealed deficiencies and maintain or extend the life limits of aircraft engines.<br />The Component Improvement Program has a very long and very distinct history dating back to the mid 1950s. It is the only program of its kind which provides development and sustainment support for the active inventory of aircraft engines. Since CIP is a tri-service program with involvement from the Army and Navy, the lead service for a particular engine is responsible for improvements to that engine. This prevents duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall conduct a continuing engineering and test program at the Contractor's facilities, at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) Tinker Air Force Base OK, at San Antonio Air Logistic Center (SA-ALC) Kelly Air Force Base TX, at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Edwards Air Force Base CA, at the Eglin Air Force Base Climatic Test Facilities Eglin Air Force Base FL, and at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) Arnold Air Force Base TN. The Contractor shall identify, fabricate, qualify and deliver the first article as identified under the Government approved Engineering Project Description (EPD) in order to support engine related changes, complex and non-complex support equipment and overall improvements in system performance, reliability and maintainability.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: <br />The Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) Branch at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential responsible business sources to provide optimal solutions to the objective of Engine CIP. <br />The Government is seeking responsible firms to furnish the following information: <br />(1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. <br />(2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc.) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712. <br />(3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide supplies identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 541712 to be more appropriate as a classification for the supplies identified above? Please include the rationale for your answer. <br />(4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature (ref: the above requirements)? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. <br />(5) What contract type do you recommend for the established requirements, and why?<br />(6) What are your capabilities/strengths with respect to performing the Engine CIP mission?<br />(7) The Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient, demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting). The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies). The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials ..." Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. <br />(8) AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in any solicitation released for this effort. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this Sources Sought/ CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive." Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy. It is the responsibility of respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel. All members of the evaluation team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The government's support contractors will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement concerning proprietary information prior to being granted access to your data.</p>
<p>RESPONSES AND PAGE LIMITATIONS: Responses to this RFI must be received No Later Than 1500 (EST) 11 Feb 2013. Information packages may be submitted to Mrs. Brenda Maizel in an Adobe or MS Word compatible format by e-mail to brenda.maizel@wpafb.af.mil, or on a Windows compatible CD by mail to the following address: Attn: AFLCMC/LPAK, Attn: Brenda Maizel, 2145 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7017.

Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights; however, if any information submitted is considered proprietary, then the pages containing such information must be marked accordingly.

Ensure that the submission provides the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated.</p>

The Contractor must be located in the City of Muskogee, in Muskogee County, no more than 20 miles from the Jack C. Montgomery Medical Center (JCMVAMC) located at 2414 E. Shawnee, Muskogee, OK 74403. This program supports veterans throughout the catchment area supported by the JCMVAMC.  This catchment area stretches from the Kansas border to the Texas border and covers the eastern part of Oklahoma.  To support the needs of veterans outside of a reasonable commuting distance, the JCMVAMC seeks lodging for those veterans to allow them to reliably take part in the IOP program. 

Type of Contract - The Government intends to award a Firm, Fixed-price contract for a base period of MAY 1, 2013 through September 30, 2013 with four one-year options to the successful offeror. 

Contract Requirements - The successful offeror(s) will be required to perform these services within the following constraints:

The contractor shall comply with all state and local laws and regulations and will report any violations thereof to the VA Contracting Officer or his or her designee Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 24 hours for non-emergency violations.  The contractor shall report all emergency related violations to the Contracting Officer or COR within 4 hours of the incident.  If the Contracting Officer and the COR are unavailable, such notification will be made to the Nurse on Duty (NOD) at (918) 577-3116.

When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with a notation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA office authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient have no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the Contractor will forward inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA office authorizing admission, and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from the  VA concerning disposition.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Dosimetry Group of the Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division within the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) has a requirement for a Low-Energy High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) spectrometer in support of their program in standards development for health care, namely air-kerma standards for mammographic x-rays. As new beam qualities are being developed by NIST to match those used in the clinic for digital mammography, measurement of the energy spectrum of photons from the x-ray tube is necessary to accurately determine correction factors for our primary standard free-air chamber. The new HPGe Spectrometer will be added to the existing mammography calibration range, measuring the x-ray spectra and enabling direct realization of air-kerma (related to patient dose). Due to incompatibility of the use of liquid nitrogen in the mammography calibration lab, the spectrometer must be cooled by a mechanical-type cooler.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Below are required specifications of the HPGe Spectrometer:</p>
<p>1. Must have an energy resolution of at least 200 eV (FWHM) at 5.9 keV;<br />2. Must have an energy range from at least 3 keV to 300 keV;<br />3. Must have an entrance window thickness less than 0.04 mm beryllium;<br />4. Must have a Mechanical-type cooler (no liquid nitrogen);</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this instrument are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above.</p>
<p>Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size and socio-economic status of business as it relates to NAICS code 334519 (Small Business size standard of 500 employees), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA federal supply schedules (if applicable) under which your company can provide the products described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years in which a similar instrument was provided.</p>
<p>All responses shall be emailed to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 5:00 pm EST January 22, 2013.</p>

<p>Phoenix Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research Branch has permanent research facilities in two locations: (1) at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) in Phoenix, Arizona; and (2) at the Hu Hu Kam Memorial Hospital (HHK) on the Gila River Indian Community at Sacaton to conduct research related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications among American Indians at both sites. For example, greater than fifty percent (50%) of adult Pima Indians and more than twenty percent (20%) of adults in many other tribes have diabetes. Therefore, the NIDDK's Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch was established to study this high-risk population.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that prompt payment to volunteer study participants is essential for both the recruitment and retention of volunteers as study participants. Consequently, on-site payment to volunteers on the day of hospital discharge or at the completion of outpatient studies is a requirement of the contract. It is also essential that the contractor maintain a bank account with a financial institution represented in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area for the purpose of issuing payment checks.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. One copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than 10 days prior to close of business (11:00 A.M. local time at designated location) on January 24, 2013.</p>
<p>For questions regarding Solicitation number NIHLM2013652 please send via email to griffinv@mail.nih.gov. <br /><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<DESC>Institutes of Health (NIH), The National Library of Medicine (NLM) on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or HUBZone small businesses that can provide measurement of the concentration and shear dependence of the viscosity of highly concentrated solutions of individual proteins, individual polymers, mixtures of proteins and mixtures of proteins and polymers.
<p><br />The Contractor shall: <br />1. Prepare highly concentrated solutions of various proteins and mixtures of proteins under conditions of varying pH and ionic strength, as specified by NIDDK. <br />2. Perform measurements of the concentration dependence of the viscosity of these solutions.<br />3. Provide detailed documentation of all preparations and measurements, and complete data obtained from each measurement.<br />4. Contribute to analysis of the results as necessary to be performed: Solutions will be prepared and measurements performed on a continuous basis during the term of the contract. Reports of progress will be provided at least once weekly by the Contractor, and consultations between NIDDK and the Contractor will be held frequently via oral or written communication, so that results may be discussed and experimental goals and protocols revised if necessary in light of results obtained.</p>
<p>Special equipment or procedures to be used: <br />The Contractor will perform the requested measurements using a viscometer/rheometer specifically designed to carry out measurements of the type that we wish to perform. The amount of sample required to perform the requested measurements is less than one tenth of that required to perform equivalent measurements using commercially available instrumentation. In addition, the unique automated dilution system incorporated into this special viscometer enables a complete profile of viscosity as a function of concentration to be obtained about twenty times more rapidly than an equivalent set of experiments can be performed using a conventional viscometer. Both of these unique capabilities are essential to performance of the requested measurements within the time frame of the requested contract. Some of the proteins that NIDDK seeks to characterize are engineered monoclonal antibodies that are available only in quantities that are too small to characterize via conventional means. Results obtained from the instrument have been validated by comparison of results obtained for small quantities of several proteins and polymers using the custom viscometer with published results obtained using much larger quantities of the same proteins and polymers in commercially available viscometers.</p>
<p>Specifications for measurement:<br />1. Total sample required for an entire concentration series: &lt;1 ml of the highest concentration solution (up to 200 g/l)</p>
<p>2. Precision of concentration determination: better than 3%</p>
<p>3. Accuracy of viscosity measurement: better than 3% of measured value</p>
<p>4. Precision of viscosity measurement: better than 0.1%</p>
<p>5. Range of viscosity measurement: 1cP to 1000 cP</p>
<p>6. Range of applied shear: 10 s-1 - 104 s-1</p>
<p>7. Temperature control: better than &plusmn; 0.5oC</p>
<p>8. Viscosity of each solution must be measured at &gt;25 concentrations obtained via serial dilutions</p>
<p>9. Optional inline measurement of concentration via absorbance</p>
<p>10. Entire series of viscosity measurements performed on a single sample at different concentrations must be completed within 3 hours to avoid sample degradation.</p>
<p>11. Measurements must be made by staff experienced in the preparation and safe handling of valuable biologically derived materials, including engineered monoclonal antibodies.<br /><br />Expected deliverables, if any:<br />Data obtained from experiments, complete documentation of all procedures performed in conduct of the experiments.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: February 1, 2013-July 31, 2013</p>
<p>This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the items listed above and to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:</p>
<p>Company name, address, phone number, primary contact(s), e-mail address, NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large) and DUNS number.<br />All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the NIMH, intends to negotiate a modification to an existing contract with the Lewin Group, 3130 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 800, Falls Church, VA 22042, Contract no. HHSN271201000033C entitled, "Study of Health Outcomes in Children with Autism and their Families", on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND </span></strong></p>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a significant public health concern, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 110 children in the United States. Much of the research to date has focused on the core social and communication deficits of ASD, but there are anecdotes and some survey data suggesting that the rate of comorbid health conditions may also be elevated in this population. Furthermore, despite several large-scale epidemiological studies that have assessed but not found any potential association between ASD and vaccinations, public concerns persist about such a causal link. At least partly as a consequence, health officials in the United States have reported an increased rate of vaccine refusal in the general population.</p>
<p>"Study of Health Outcomes in Children with Autism and Their Families" awarded on a competitive basis on 09/20/2010 to The Lewin Group under Contract # HHSN271201000033C, is a cost-reimbursement research and development type contract, and currently expires on February 15, 2013. Under this contract, The Lewin Group analyzed a large dataset of retrospective commercial health plan claims of 46,236 children with ASD, their parents and siblings, and a comparison cohort of children and family members. They successfully completed the analyses requested in the original statement of work, which included a study of the validity of ASD diagnoses in the claims data, and descriptions of health outcomes and health care utilization of the ASD cohort, their family members, and the comparison cohorts. The purpose of this contract modification is to conduct additional analyses on the extent of vaccination coverage and health outcomes of the younger siblings of children with ASD and younger siblings of the comparison cohort, and examine the relationships between health outcomes and vaccine history.</p>
<p>The Lewin Group is uniquely qualified to perform this work. The size and geographic diversity of the administrative database is unique, as is the ability to link medical, pharmacy, and behavioral coverage, and family members. A validation study of ASD diagnoses has already been conducted with the claims data. About 60% of the resources of the original contract were used to obtain the necessary administrative permissions to use the databases, conduct the validation study of the ASD diagnoses, link the appropriate data sources, determine the cohort with adequate continuous coverage, and determine the study variables. Thus, significant federal resources have been used to develop this unique database, and the questions now on the table are directly related to prior analyses using this data. An attempt to solicit the same analyses from another source would result in a duplication of effort, expending significantly more funding and time. A new contractor would be unable to meet the same efficiency levels that The Lewin Group has established at this stage of completion of the study. Under the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) and FAR 6.302-1, The Lewin Group is the only source capable of meeting the requirements of this project.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose OF THIS PROPOSED ACTION is to extend the CONTRACT'S current period of performance an additional 12 months, and, provide for follow up of previous findings with additional analyses using a proprietary database derived and validated under the contract.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</span></strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the contract modification will address the following: (a) The extent of vaccination in younger siblings of children with ASD and the comparison cohort; and (b) The health outcomes in younger siblings of the children with ASD and the comparison cohort, with respect to medical and neuropsychiatric disorders (including ASD), including relationship of these outcomes to vaccine history.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REPORTS/DELIVERABLES:</span></strong> All reports shall be submitted in electronic form as PC-formatted computer files in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and/or searchable PDF format.&nbsp; The following reports will be required: A. Quarterly Technical Progress Reports, the contractor shall provide a report no later than the 30th calendar day of the month in which the quarter ends (e.g. March 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, etc.); B. Annual Progress Reports, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer (CO) with two copies of the Annual Progress Report in draft form in accordance with the DELIVERIES Article in SECTION F of the Contract/10 Calendar days prior to the delivery date for the Final Version of the Annual Report. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will review the draft report and provide the CO with comments within 5 calendar days after receipt. The Annual Progess Report shall be corrected by the Contractor, if necessary and the final version delivered as specified in the above paragraph. C. Final Progress Report and Summary of Salient Results, a final report shall be submitted on or before the last day of the period of performance. This report shall include a summation of the work performed and results obtained for the entire contract period of performance. This report shall be in sufficient detail to explain comprehensively the Tasks accomplished and the results achieved, and shall summarize data and statistical analyses performed in text, tabular and graphical form. D. Other Reports and Deliverables: 1. Data File Turnover Report, an electronic and hardcopy report is required by completion date of contract; 2. Data Sharing (National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) data entry, an electronic and hardcopy report is provided upon request by COR; 3. Small Busines Subcontracting Plan, an annual report is due (see http://www.esrs.gov); 4. Contractor-Employee non-Disclosure Agreement(s), an electronic and hardcopy report is applicable before an employee begins work; 5. Updated IT Security Plan (in accordance with NIST SP 800-26 Secuirty Self Assessment Guide), an electronic and hardcopy is due annually with the corresponding quarterly progress report; 6. Information Security Training Report, an electronic and hardcopy is to be included with original and subsequent revisions with each technical progress report; 7. Section 508 Annual Report (as applicable), an electronic and hardcopy is due annually with the corresponding annual progress report and with the final technical progress report; and 8. Annual and Final Invention Disclosure Reports, an electronic and hardcopy is due in accordance with FAR Clause 52.227-11, Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contracting, with annual and final technical reports.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</span></strong> The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month performance year from 2/16/2013 through 2/15/2014.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:</span></strong> (1) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is will be 541720; (2) The Contractor must use the data management system developed for and used for the Study of Health Outcomes in Children and Autism and Their Families Study. Because the Lewin Group is the sole proprietor of this specific version, access to this data management system is limited. The database is unique in its size and geographic diversity; (3) A validation study of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) diagnoses has already been completed by the Contractor; (4) To answer further questions, the current data source has to be used; any other potential sources would not have access rights to the database, and, would have to duplicate the effort already expended under the current existing contract with Lewin to develop and validate a database, as well as to duplicate the already-completed analyses of health outcomes and health care service use. This would result in significant additional and duplicative costs to the Government, and, significant delay delivery of the final research findings.</p>

This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division (NSWC, IHD). The purpose of this Sources Sought is to seek the availability and capability of qualified contractors that are interested in and capable of performing the work described therein:
The Joint Staff (TJS) is currently the program manager of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) capability known as the Enterprise Business Accountability System (EBAS).
 The EBAS Program Manager requires contractor support for EBAS. The EBAS PM provides cross services to select DoD Agencies as a Shared Service Provider (SSP) for Momentum. The solution consists of three integrated financial and budget systems: Comptroller Automated Budget System (CABS), the Programming Budget System (PBS), and the Exhibit Automation System (EAS). CABS and PBS are implementations of CGIs Momentum Financials and Momentum Performance Budgeting (PB), respectively. EAS is a Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solution. Additional EBAS tools include: eAcquisition or eACQ (a procurement requirements, funding, and approval workflow), eORF (a workflow supporting spending and approvals of Official Representation Funds), and eTraining or eTRAIN (a workflow supporting the approvals and SF 182 forms required for requesting and funding, training).
 These additional EBAS tools are built in webMethods, and support generation of forms, digital signatures, and back-end financial updates and funds control directly in the CABS application. The suite of integrated tools and systems, its interfaces, automated workflows applications, and COGNOS reporting capability collectively allow EBAS to automate DoD Agencies business processes. EBAS represents an end-to-end Program, Budget, Execution, Accounting, and Reporting solution, automating and integrating processes from formulation and justification through execution.

In this capacity, the EBAS performs the following high level functions with contractor support.

<DESC>AMENDED SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

This sources sought amends the prior sources sought (N00244-13-T-0051) issued on December 19th, 2012 via the US Navys, NECO (Naval Electronic Commerce Online) website. In view of the responses received, the Navy is clarifying its requirement to ensure this market survey is consistent with its funding; Operation & Maintenance, Navy (O&M,N), and not development funds.  The Navy is seeking a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Modified Off the Shelf (MOTS) product currently available product, and will not consider a custom developed software product to be responsive, as it will impact the required delivery time. The Navy is seeking information on existing COTS or MOTS software products that are known or proven to be compatible with Business Objects Enterprise (BOE) software infrastructure currently used (or currently in place)  at Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRC-SW).
 

BOE is the standard reporting tool that is used to leverage reporting processes across FRCs. BOE manages and provides business decisions at the local level and across the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE). BOE requires stringent oversight and administrative tasks for ultimate operating efficiency. The administrative tasks, amount of monitoring required, and Navy security mandates are very time consuming and lead to errors due to existing manual inputs. The desired COTS software solution needs to manage the BOE environment and assist in satisfying all internal security audit requirements with less human effort. 

The desired COTS software solution shall have the capability to perform the minimum salient functions:
1.	Ability to track inactive users, reuse unused licenses, ability to address compliance including audit requirements
2.	Set up security permissions dynamically using web matrices and perform complete security assessment on demand
3.	Selectively restore deleted or corrupt BOE content
4.	Keep copies of the BOE environment to be able to see changes at any given time
5.	Run impact analysis to determine effect of any universe or SQL changes
6.	Identifies unused documents and universes and track duplicated objects or reports
7.	Migrate content between different environments using drag and drop method
8.	Document and audit Security used on reports, SQL restrictions, and universes
9.	Run backup and recovery of the BOE environment

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 511210 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 7030.
 Interested vendors that offer COTS software products which they believe to meet the above performance requirements shall indentify their software product name and performance features. Responses must be received January 17th, 2013 1200 (PST). For information regarding this amended sources sought contact  Jose Neto, Contract Specialist; email jose.neto@navy.mil. Proprietary data will be protected when so designated. Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made. Availability of any formal solicitation may be announced separately. This is NOT a request for quote (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), or an announcement of a solicitation as no solicitation package exists at this time. The request is for informal market survey purposes only.
 No cost data should be submitted. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice, and may not provide follow-up information if  requested. NAVSUP FLCSD intends to utilize the information provided for acquisition planning purposes only.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Defense Information Systems Agency requires an Independent Public Accountant (IPA) to audit the financial statements of both the DISA Working Capital Fund (WCF) and DISA General Fund (GF). The IPA firm will be responsible for an audit of the balance sheet of the WCF and GF and of the related statements of net cost, changes in net position, and budgetary resources. The vendor will then provide a report in accordance with the terms and conditions of the resultant contract and in conformance with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. The vendor will perform the audit in conformance with the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) generally accepted government auditing standards, the GAO/President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM), and auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. <br /><br />Both the WCF and GF entities are highly complex, providing state of the art information technology (IT) support throughout the Department of Defense, to include combatant commands and the Office of the President of the United States. Vendors must demonstrate the capability to staff, recruit and retain, qualified auditors in sufficient numbers to successfully perform this audit. The Government estimates this effort will require between 50-60 highly qualified auditors. The result will be the expression of an opinion on whether DISA's WCF and GF financial statements are fairly presented in all material aspects and in conformity with U.S. GAAP. They will report any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal controls which could effectively prevent or detect misstatements, losses, or noncompliance, which are material to the financial statements; and report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance. The audit will report whether DISA's financial management systems with respect to the WCF and GF substantially comply with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA). <br /><br />To perform this engagement, a qualified IPA should demonstrate experience and ability to audit a complex global enterprise in a highly technical, IT/telecommunications environment. Prospective offerors must demonstrate experience successfully performing audits of this nature within the Department of Defense. DoD agencies identified in your capability proposals must be of equal or greater complexity than the Defense Information Systems Agency.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION.  Concerns having the ability to expand the current USGS Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) in accordance with the most recent requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS 201).  The system shall provide for detecting, delaying, and deterring unauthorized individuals from entering the internal offices and suites while providing access to authorized personnel.   The PACS shall consist of a PACS controller; access control panels (ACPs), FIPS 201 reader, and related sensor and door control devices.  The PACS controller shall be a network appliance, while the ACPs may be either a traditional multi-door control panel, or a single-door edge devise.   Security Install Solutions, Inc. (SIS) currently has the warranty and maintenance responsibility for the USGS PACS System along with security clearances/access and knowledge of the current system and design.  Access and expansion by another contractor may potentially void the standing warranties and result in compromising security at existing locations.  SIS currently has all background checks through both USGS and GSA and has full access to all building on the DFC.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Security Install Solutions, Inc., 5305 E. Evans Ave, Ste. 102, Denver, CO 80222 and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who fell they can furnish the required item or their functional equivalents (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

Notice Type: 
Sources Sought 
Synopsis: 
This is a Sources Sought notice for the purpose of identifying available small business general construction firms for the construction project identified below.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) is seeking a small business general construction firm to perform Project No. 663-405, Building 101 Mental Health Services - Phase 1 | Parking Structure and Main Entry Drive, at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division, 1660 South Columbian Way, Seattle, WA 98108.  The general construction firm must be classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) (2), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Section 8(a), and/or (6) HUBZone.  The magnitude of this construction project is between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000. Interested general construction firms must be firms with an approved NAICS Code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.   A bid bond as well as payment and performance bonds shall be required. 

Background:
The VA Puget Sound HCS/Seattle Division is located in an area of high seismic activity.  The Puget Sound Area has experienced 25 damaging earthquakes since the late 1800s, and a 6.0 or greater earthquake is predicted for the region every 10 years.  A VA-contracted risk assessment indicated that many of the VAPSHCS buildings are at risk of collapse during a design-level earthquake of 6.7 or greater. In 2001, the VA initiated the Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) program.  This program required a 100-percent inventory of VHA's capital assets and the development of a long-range plan to address program gaps.  The seismic vulnerability and other infrastructure deficiencies of the VAPSHCS were also cited. There have been no major construction projects at the Seattle Division campus related to mental health in over 11 years; yet over the same period the number of Veterans seen in outpatient mental health clinics increased by 39 percent. All mental health and research space is currently fully occupied and does not meet current needs or future workload projections. VAPSHCS has been cited as having a severe shortage of space and that many of the laboratories were in need of major renovation or replacement.  The additional square footage provided by the construction of the new Building 101 will address the CARES identified square footage shortfall, allow for the consolidation of mental health clinics, administration and research space to facilitate more effective utilization of resources, double the amount of dedicated clinical research space, and provides additional square footage of laboratory space and associated office space to meet current deficiencies.

This project, Phase 1 of the Building 101 Mental Health Services Seismic Renovation and Construction project, consists of the construction of the Main Entry Drive and a 1,000-space Parking Structure at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System/Seattle Division campus.
The scope of work will include construction of a new multi-level 1,000 car parking structure consisting of approximately 343,000 SF aboveground and 66,000 SF underground.  The underground portion will include ventilation systems, lighting, emergency power and elevators. Elevators will also be included at two locations in the aboveground portion of the garage. Phase 1 work also consists of the relocation of major underground utility systems, extensive civil grading and retaining-wall work as well as construction of an emergency power duct bank. The Entry Drive work includes grading, realignment and widening of the campus entry drive and walkways that serve the main hospital, a new garage and the provision of temporary access routes for emergency vehicles during construction. 

At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a solicitation. Bondable small business contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought.  

Responses should include the following information: 
1. Company Name
2. Address
3. Point of Contact
4. Phone number and e-mail address
5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status
6. DUNS number
7. Available Bonding Capacity
8. Construction experience of similar size and complexity (The estimated price range for this project is between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000). 

Please provide your email responses to jeremy.bedner@va.gov by 3:00 p.m. (PST) on February 25, 2012.
Small business concerns failing to respond to this ad will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation. 

NOTE: This is not a Request for Proposal and the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue solicitation documents for this project.
NOTE: If this project is solicited as "full and open competition", in order to mitigate adverse effects to the small business community, prospective large prime contractors will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan as part of their bids. The ability to meet and exceed small business goals will be incorporated into the source selection criteria.  In addition, prospective large prime contractors will be encouraged to enter into small business teaming agreements.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE DARPA-SN-13-18, UFP PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Upward Falling Payload (UFP) program on Friday, January 25, 2012 from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM in Arlington, VA at the DARPA Conference Center, in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-13-17 (expected to be released prior to the Conference). The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the UFP program; promote additional discussion on this topic; and to address questions from potential proposers.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />Cost and complexity limit the number of ships and weapon systems the Navy can support in forward operating areas. This concentration of force structure is magnified as areas of contested environments grow. A natural response is to develop lower-cost unmanned and distributed systems that can deliver effects and situation awareness at a distance. However, power and logistics to deliver these systems over vast ocean areas limit their utility. The Upward Falling Payload (UFP) program intends to overcome these barriers. The objective of the UFP program is to realize a new approach for enabling forward deployed unmanned distributed systems that can provide non-lethal effects or situation awareness over large maritime areas. The approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface. The UFP system is envisioned to consist of three key subsystems: (1) The &lsquo;payload' which executes waterborne or airborne applications after being deployed to the surface, (2) The UFP &lsquo;riser' which provides pressure tolerant encapsulation and launch (ascent) of the payload, and (3) The UFP communications which triggers the UFP riser to launch. A multi-phase effort is envisioned to design, develop, and demonstrate UFP systems.  <br /> <br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  <br />All participants must pre-register for the conference no later than 12:00 PM EST January 22, 2013, and must provide a corporate DUNs code.  Please include the subject "UFP Proposers' Day" in all submissions and correspondence.  Details on the conference, including registration information and directions to the facility are available for download at the UFP Registration website http://www.solers.com/BAAinfo-reg/UFP/.  There is no registration fee for attendance.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and only open to US contractors.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all attendees are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens will not be permitted to attend.  The completed Citizenship Form must be emailed to DARPA-BAA-13-17@darpa.mil or faxed to:  Jason Allio, ManTech, fax: 703-248-1918, phone: 703-526-1706 no later than 12:00 EST January 22, 2013.  This document is available for download at the registration website.</p>
<p>A confirmation email that includes directions to the facility and other additional information will be sent to your provided email address upon receipt of the US Citizenship form.  Additional information about the conference center can be found at: http://www.darpa.mil/about/contact/visitor_guidelines.aspx</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to the BAA for this program.  Due to space limitations at the conference facility, attendance will be limited to no more than 2 representatives per organization (unless the registration does not fill to capacity, in which case the 2 representatives per company restriction may be lifted).  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity Contracting Office - East intends to extend Contract No. W91QUZ-06-D-0017/Task Order 8S01 on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of the DMA interim IT support services. The objective is to extend the performance period for six (6) months. This extension will ensure program continuity and critical mission support while allowing the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated with a competitive follow-on procurement.
<p>The current Contractor provides the following IT support services to:</p>
<p>a. DMA HQ operations. Services include: internal network (ANET) operations and management, help desk, and application development.</p>
<p>b. DINFOS operations. Services include: internal network operations and management, help desk, and application development.</p>
<p>c. DVI operations. Services include: system administration, web development, training, database administration and application development.</p>
<p>d. Technical Serviccs B-Net operations. Services include: internal network operations and management and help desk, mission critical safety, health, and environmental support services for the NASA/DFRC Edwards and Palmdale locations.</p>
<p>Services are currently obtained using a&nbsp;firm-fixed price (FFP)&nbsp;task order against&nbsp;an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Contractor provides all resources, including labor, supervision, materials and management necessary to perform information technology functions.</p>
<p>The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period of performance for six months from 1 April 2013 through 30 September 2013. The current contractor, Lockheed-Martin, is considered the only contractor that can meet DMA IT support services requirements given the potentially short period of performance for the extension. Award to another source while the competitive process for a follow-on contract is occurring would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and would also not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling DMA IT support requirements.</p>

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Offerors are highly encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> HQ Army Material Command <br> Office of Command Counsel <br> 9301 Chapel Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> Ft.

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the <br> present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor <br> contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. <br> (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) <br>  <br> HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin <br> Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, <br> Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and <br> Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another <br> day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees <br> involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE <br> FOLLOWING: <br>  <br> 1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category. <br>  <br>  <br> ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** <br>  <br> If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract <br> (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state <br> or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by <br> laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by <br> an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the <br> wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance <br> with the following standards as compliance: <br>  <br> The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an <br> adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the <br> actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance <br> is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors <br> subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide <br> collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the <br> furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all <br> employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 <br> cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are <br> made of  quote mark wash and wear quote mark  materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other <br> personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry <br> cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the <br> cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, <br> by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement <br> that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>  <br> The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the <br>  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations quote mark , Fifth Edition, April 2006, <br> unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the <br> Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at <br> http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) <br> Web site at http://wdol.gov/. <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard <br> Form 1444 (SF 1444)} <br>  <br> Conformance Process: <br>  <br> The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which <br> is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the <br> work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage <br> determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable <br> relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted <br> classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such <br> conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished <br> the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be <br> initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such <br> unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or <br> fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. <br> {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a <br> contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to <br> which a class(es) is to be conformed. <br>  <br> The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>  <br> 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed <br> occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). <br>  <br> 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in <br> order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for <br> each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed <br> wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of <br> the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no <br> authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be <br> submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted <br> class(es) of employees performs any contract work. <br>  <br> 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a <br> report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent <br> information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the <br> Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of <br> Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>  <br> 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or <br> disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or <br> notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to <br> process the request. <br>  <br> 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the <br> contractor. <br>  <br> 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. <br>  <br> Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond <br> paper. <br>  <br> When preparing a conformance request, the  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of <br> Occupations quote mark  (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure <br> that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in <br> the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required <br> tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage <br> determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or <br> subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. <br>  <br>  <br> REQUIRED RESPONSE DATE: Quotes MUST be received by Thursday, January 17th 2012. Electronic submissions via email or facsimile (fax) will be accepted. If you An official authorized to bind your company shall sign the quote. Questions concerning this solicitation should be addressed to Jake Perrotta, Contract Specialist, via email at jake.r.perrotta.civ@mail.mil. All questions or inquiries must be submitted in writing/e-mail.  <br>  <br> Submission of quote, through alternative electronic points of entry, will be deemed unacceptable. The quote will need to be completed and sent via electronic email or fax to the Contracting Specialist; either to jake.r.perrotta.civ@mail.mil or fax # (609) 562-3625. <br>

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>A. GENERAL INFORMATION
<p>1. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) NIHLM2013626-SV and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through December 2012 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars 2005-63. This is a small business set aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237130.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional for the following features and capabilities:</p>
<p>Dark fiber (i.e. fiber unlit-by-electronics) for two diverse-path connections between the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Telephone Equipment Room Building 38A 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20894 (NPA/NNX 301/435) and the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) consortium facilities located at the University of Maryland Computer and Space Sciences Building, Building #224 Room 0312A, College Park, MD 20742-2411 (NPA/NNX 301/405) is required in order for the NLM to communicate and physically exchange Internet traffic with domestic and international biomedical researchers via advanced communication systems in a diverse and robust manner. These redundant diverse fibers will need to continue as long as necessary into the immediate future so that the NLM can continue to communicate with its users and research partners over advanced high-performance networks in a reliable fashion. Many NLM users domestically and internationally access its resources via high-performance connections at their respective institutions which in turn connect with their regional aggregation points which in turn connect to their respective national research and education networks all of which enables continued collaboration and advances in biomedical research and development. This worldwide network of advanced research and education networks and their peering arrangements is the structure by which this happens. The MAX operates, in the Washington, DC area the regional aggregation point for traffic to/from domestic and international destinations.</p>
<p>All proposals received by January 22, 2013 at 12:00 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) will be considered by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Responses must be in writing, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirements. All responses from responsible sources will be considered.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates the AC-695A Jet Prop Commander Aircraft in various locations throughout the United States and Canada. It has been determined that the AC-695A Jet Prop Commander will be based out of Flying Cloud Airport (KFCM) to be operated in support of critical snow survey related research and soil moisture data collection throughout the entirety of the year. Due to winter weather conditions in the Minneapolis area and the requirements for the aircraft, it is necessary that the aircraft be kept in a heated hangar during the period March 31, 2013 through March 30, 2014. In addition to heated hangar requirements during winter months, the aircraft further requires hangar during the remainder of the year to prolong the life of the aircraft and sensitive scientific mission equipment for soil moisture data collection.</p>
<p>b) SCOPE. NOAA's AC-695A Jet Prop Commander aircraft will be operating out of Flying Cloud Airport in Eden Prairie (KFCM) in support of snow survey and soil moisture research nationwide. The AC-695A Jet Prop Commander is used by the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) to conduct aerial soil moisture and snow surveys in the United States and Canada. Snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements are gathered during the winter months over a number of flight lines at 500 feet above the ground at ground speeds ranging between 100 and 120 knots. Gamma radiation emitted from trace elements of potassium, uranium and thorium radioisotopes in the upper 20 cm of soil is attenuated by soil moisture and water mass in the snow cover. Information collected during snow survey missions, along with photographic data, is used by the National Weather Service River Forecasting Centers and other government agencies to forecast river levels, water flow, and potential flooding events due to spring snowmelt water runoff.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) AC-695A Jet Prop Commander aircraft having a wingspan of 52 feet, length 43 feet and 14 feet 11.5 inches high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored. <br /><br />Security clause 1352.239-72 does not apply to the SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>The following services are requested as part of the hangar lease price. If there are extra charges or fees for any of these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental price, provide separate pricing information for each item:</p>
<p>1) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a) DC external power unit,<br />b) Ground service equipment on an as needed basis,<br />c) Tow vehicle and driver for aircraft movement in and out of hangar. <br />2) Hangar amenities including: tools, equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power,<br />3) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew,<br />4) Storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft,<br />5) Acceptance of Multiservice Air Card for payment of incidentals.</p>
<p>c) PERFORMANCE PERIOD. The hangar lease is required from March 31, 2013 through March 20, 2014, which is the base period, with one six-month option period. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site and from use of the hangar without incurring any additional fees or penalties associated with departing early. At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>d) INSURANCE. The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

As such, it is imperative that the magnetic tapes used for backup be both covered by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty and not cause errors during either the backup process, or during any potential file restore process.   Previous attempts to use non-standard brands of tape caused errors to occur during nightly backup processing, resulting in an increased number of hours needed for the support staff to troubleshoot and correct, and adding a high level of risk to the Agency backup process. <BR> <BR>No Section 508 standards apply to this solicitation as it is for the purchase of a media storage device. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200030 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>

<p><br />It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France (F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  OFDA's Office of the Director is responsible for management of OFDA's strategic relationship with IOs and NGOs, leading external coordination efforts with traditional and non-traditional donors, leading efforts in humanitarian policy and humanitarian architecture work, setting the strategic direction for OFDA's work with multi-lateral organizations, and establishing OFDA policy on a range of humanitarian issues and managing global programs.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Senior Disaster Operations Specialists (SDOSs) play a central role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk reduction programs.  They assist in developing response strategies, in managing all aspects of grants for humanitarian donor organizations, and in preparing talking points, information products, and briefing material.  They manage complex portfolios consisting of one or several countries with multiple and sometimes competing priorities, and are members of regionally focused humanitarian response teams consisting of Disaster Operations Specialists (DOSs), a Regional Coordinator, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists. The SDOS provides technical guidance and mentoring to DOSs and serves as a focal point for program-related planning efforts.</p>
<p>SDOSs are part of the Disaster Response Team (DRT) within DRM.  This team consists of five regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA), Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean (ASIA/LAC), Southern, Western and Northern Africa (SWAN), East and Central Africa (ECA) and Sudan.  Each regional group is managed by a Regional Coordinator.</p>
<p>SDOSs demonstrate a mastery of a regional area of specialization, extensive knowledge in a wide range of humanitarian concepts, principles, and practices with demonstrated ability to apply this knowledge in to difficult and complex work in environments.  The SDOS must also have an expertise in USG assistance award management from the USG perspective, including the ability to apply this expertise to developing recommendations to resolve complex issues.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--   <br>   (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;    <br>   (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and   <br>   (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and   <br>   (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.   <br>   (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:   <br>   (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.   <br>   (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.   <br>   (ii) Examples.   <br>   (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.   <br>   (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.   <br>   (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.   <br>   (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code).   <br>   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]   <br>   (1) Listed End Product   <br>   Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin:   <br>     	     <br>     	     <br>     	     <br>   (2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.   <br>   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-   <br>   (1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or    <br>   (2) [_] Outside the United States.   <br>   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]   <br>   (1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

Para 20.1 states that the "average daily rate (ADR) will be, at a minimum, sufficient to accomplish all work within a thirty day period based on the estimated quantity of debris in the area," suggesting a 30-day performance period after NTP.

Therefore, if an incumbent is selected at the GS-11 grade level, the candidate does not have the opportunity for advancement to the GS-12 equivalent grade.  However, once the candidate reaches the minimum qualifications of the GS-12 grade, he/she may apply for a GS-12 position if the position is resolicited by the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI in the future.  Extension of the contract is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C. with possible travel as stated in the position description.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely assistance to support and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances are designed to promote progress or prevent backsliding. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI USPSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time.  The Program Operations Advisor position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  To achieve this, OTI requires a Program Operations Advisor who has the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit. A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs.  The Program Operations Advisor provides services which require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and operational expertise in administrative support.  This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation.  While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel.  OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.  The Program Operations Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee which may be the Deputy Chief of OMD or other OMD Team Leaders, the Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD) or FPD Regional Team Leaders.  The Program Operations Advisor will spend the majority of his or her time working with OMD support staff in Washington.  All of the field activities supported and the vast majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Program Operations Advisor to support the Operations and Management Division within OTI.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Program Operations Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Program Operations Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Program Operations Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>This is a solicitation prepared in accordance with FAR 12.3 and 15.2 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND NO OTHER WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The Government will evaluate proposals in response to this solicitation without discussions. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular. Applicable FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and may be viewed on the following websites</p>
<p>https://www.acquisition.gov/<br />https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html<br />http://www.dm.usda.gov/procurement/policy/agar_x/agarbase/index.html</p>
<p><br />Delivery required by April 01, 2013<br />All Subject to Sample Approval.</p>
<p><br />Offeror shall submit a firm-fixed price offer for all costs necessary to furnish all equipment, labor, transportation, supplies, etc. needed to provide the Agar Powdered USP, NF according to the specifications. Price proposals should be of sufficient detail to determine their adequacy.</p>
<p>The Pink BollWorm Rearing Facility (PBWRF) in Phoenix, AZ uses agar as a binding agent in the artificial insect diet prepared for rearing larvae of the pink bollworm. Contrary to most artificial insect diets containing agar, the pink bollworm diet is not left intact as poured, but is shredded into noodles approximately 5 mm wide and of varying thickness and length. Because of this special method of use, the agar acts more as a binding agent than it does a gelling agent as in other insect diets. As such, the requirements are more critical in terms of physical properties especially the strength of the gel (1.34% concentration) and the ability to retain moisture for a relatively long period of time. The agar supplied shall be the dried product of the water soluble extract of a species of Pterocladium, Gelidium or Gracilaria confervoides.</p>
<p>Excessive moisture loss from the diet results in two problems. If the loss comes from moisture-holding capability of the agar, the nutrients in the diet become too concentrated and if the loss comes from excessive syneresis, the resultant free moisture creates an unhealthy habitat for the larvae. In the case of the pink bollworm, the artificial diet not only provides the larvae with essential nutrients for their development, but also provides their living space. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SF1449 FOR PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Testing and Approval of Product <br />Contractors wishing to submit an offer for this proposal need to submit a sample which needs to be shipped, separate from the actual proposal, to the PBWRF in, Phoenix, Arizona. Failure to submit a "Sample", or failure of the offerors' sample(s) to meet specifications, or submitting the actual offer (pricing) to the PBWRF in Phoenix, Arizona will render an offer non-responsive and ineligible for award. DO NOT INCLUDE PRICING WITH THE OFFEROR SAMPLE.</p>
<p>A one (1) pound sample of agar must be received at the following location prior to the date and time specified for receipt of offers:</p>
<p>USDA, APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine<br />Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility<br />Solicitation - APHIS-PBWRF-618868 <br />Attn: Eoin Davis<br />3645 E. Chipman<br />Phoenix, Arizona 85040</p>
<p><br />In the event the sample differs in any way from the agar to be supplied to the PBWRF, the offeror is to state how the sample differs. Contractor shall furnish for each sample supplied, the species of algae (binomial scientific name), geographical source, and time of year the seaweed was collected.<br />The sample will be evaluated within 14 days to determine compliance with the specifications. Agar must meet all parameters listed in technical critieria. If the sample fails the gel strength twice, further testing will be suspended. Products delivered under any resulting contract shall strictly' comply with the approved sample for gel strength and moisture retention. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed.<br />The contractor may not substitute a different type or form of Agar unless this is approved prior by the government.<br />In the event of multiple awards and the agar is purchased from more than one vendor, the vendor can provide the agar in one shipment or multiple shipments. If multiple shipments, the contractor can divide the agar into three equal parts and provide the agar according to the delivery date specified.</p>
<p>Instructions to offerors:</p>
<p>1. In accordance with FAR 52.212-1 (J) Provision and &amp; 52.212-4 (T) (1 Commercial Terms and Conditions clause; Any entity wishing to do business with the federal government under a Federal Acquisition must be registered in SAM At http://sam.gov. Federal agencies may require entities be registered in SAM for additional processes. Also, consider creating a SAM account if you wish to utilize the full set of capabilities that have been developed in SAM and/or migrated from legacy systems (CCR, FedReg, ORCA and EPLS). ***REGISTRATION IS FREE***</p>
<p>2. Any entity doing business with the Federal Government must also obtain a Dunn and Bradstreet number. If your company does not have a DUNS number, you may contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one by calling 1- 866-705-5711 or via the following website:<br />http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform</p>
<p>3. Please complete and return all of the following Representations, certifications and other statements of offerors or respondents found in the attached SF1449 Addendum II pages 16 thru 31</p>
<p>52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012) <br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (FEB 2012) <br />AGAR 452.209 - 70 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction. (FEB 2012)<br />52.225-6 -- Trade Agreements Certificate (Jan 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. Delivery and price are significantly less important than technical performance, and Delivery is more important than Price.</p>

<DESC>National Institutes of Health (NIH), The National Library of Medicine (NLM) on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or HUBZone small businesses that can provide measurement of the concentration and shear dependence of the viscosity of highly concentrated solutions of individual proteins, individual polymers, mixtures of proteins and mixtures of proteins and polymers.
<p><br />The Contractor shall: <br />1. Prepare highly concentrated solutions of various proteins and mixtures of proteins under conditions of varying pH and ionic strength, as specified by NIDDK. <br />2. Perform measurements of the concentration dependence of the viscosity of these solutions.<br />3. Provide detailed documentation of all preparations and measurements, and complete data obtained from each measurement.<br />4. Contribute to analysis of the results as necessary to be performed: Solutions will be prepared and measurements performed on a continuous basis during the term of the contract. Reports of progress will be provided at least once weekly by the Contractor, and consultations between NIDDK and the Contractor will be held frequently via oral or written communication, so that results may be discussed and experimental goals and protocols revised if necessary in light of results obtained.</p>
<p>Special equipment or procedures to be used: <br />The Contractor will perform the requested measurements using a viscometer/rheometer specifically designed to carry out measurements of the type that we wish to perform. The amount of sample required to perform the requested measurements is less than one tenth of that required to perform equivalent measurements using commercially available instrumentation. In addition, the unique automated dilution system incorporated into this special viscometer enables a complete profile of viscosity as a function of concentration to be obtained about twenty times more rapidly than an equivalent set of experiments can be performed using a conventional viscometer. Both of these unique capabilities are essential to performance of the requested measurements within the time frame of the requested contract. Some of the proteins that NIDDK seeks to characterize are engineered monoclonal antibodies that are available only in quantities that are too small to characterize via conventional means. Results obtained from the instrument have been validated by comparison of results obtained for small quantities of several proteins and polymers using the custom viscometer with published results obtained using much larger quantities of the same proteins and polymers in commercially available viscometers.</p>
<p>Specifications for measurement:<br />1. Total sample required for an entire concentration series: &lt;1 ml of the highest concentration solution (up to 200 g/l)</p>
<p>2. Precision of concentration determination: better than 3%</p>
<p>3. Accuracy of viscosity measurement: better than 3% of measured value</p>
<p>4. Precision of viscosity measurement: better than 0.1%</p>
<p>5. Range of viscosity measurement: 1cP to 1000 cP</p>
<p>6. Range of applied shear: 10 s-1 - 104 s-1</p>
<p>7. Temperature control: better than &plusmn; 0.5oC</p>
<p>8. Viscosity of each solution must be measured at &gt;25 concentrations obtained via serial dilutions</p>
<p>9. Optional inline measurement of concentration via absorbance</p>
<p>10. Entire series of viscosity measurements performed on a single sample at different concentrations must be completed within 3 hours to avoid sample degradation.</p>
<p>11. Measurements must be made by staff experienced in the preparation and safe handling of valuable biologically derived materials, including engineered monoclonal antibodies.<br /><br />Expected deliverables, if any:<br />Data obtained from experiments, complete documentation of all procedures performed in conduct of the experiments.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: February 1, 2013-July 31, 2013</p>
<p>This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the items listed above and to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:</p>

A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than close of business (2:00 pm local time at designated location) on January 22, 2013. Responses by fax or e-mail WILL BE ACCEPTED. This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.<br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>

<a href="mailto:dshannon@usgs.gov">dshannon@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in chartering an offshore research vessel (oceanographic research vessel) capable of working in broken sea ice to support a walrus radio-tagging project in the northern Chukchi Sea for a maximum of 14 days between July 11  and 25 2013.  Actual trip timing and length will depend on the weather and sea ice and the billing will reflect actual charter days.  The work area will be the northeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  The vessel will support two workboats in performing the science mission: One workboat will be outfitted and provided by USGS (USGS owned and equipped workboat) and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  A second (similarly outfitted) workboat will be provided by the contractor.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, or other appropriate port near the target field work, board the science crew, and continue to the work area for arrival to the work area by about July 14, 2013.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be 150 nautical miles west of Barrow, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.  Radio-tagging will occur for up to 10 days, and then the vessel will return the science crew to the nearest suitable logistics base, with a preference for Wainwright or Nome.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of up to 9 people working for USGS, as well a suitable workboat and boat operator experienced in small boat handling offshore in sea ice.  The size of the USGS crew will be agreed upon at least one month prior to sailing.   Complete specifications for the subject charter vessel will be described in the solicitation.
As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming Solicitation (G13PS00106) will be made available through the GPE on or about January 25, 2013.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be conducted as a competitive acquisition under the provisions of under FAR Parts 12 and 15, and will be designated as a 100% small business set-aside.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at email dshannon@usgs.gov (916-278-9342). This requirement is subject to availability of funds.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS:<br /></strong>The Distribution Tunnel System (DTS) serves as an infrastructure for conveying combined sewage overflow (CSO) to the Chicagoland Underflow Plan (CUP) McCook Reservoir Project, expected to be online within this decade. The reservoir will provide nearly 10 billion gallons of storage for Chicago's Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) from overflow at the existing Mainstream and Des Plaines tunnels. The DTS also serves to distribute stored CSO in the reservoir to the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant once floodwater recedes and plant treatment capacity is alleviated. Facilities for the DTS include a Control Building, Access Shaft and Valve Chamber that suffered structural damage, allowing water to seep in and cause inundation. Water mixed with raw sewage produced a corrosive environment that damaged various components of the facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />The Control Building is at ground surface above the chamber, which is located approximately 300ft below the surface, connected by the 26-feet diameter shaft. The McCook Reservoir DTS Repairs project will consist of repair and/or replacement of the systems affected by water and/or corrosion damage in addition to new improvements for existing facilities.

<p><br />1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE REQUIRING AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>a. Requesting Activity:</p>
<p>Defense Finance and Accounting Service<br />ATTN: DFAS-DCIP<br />8899 East 56th Street<br />Column 316-Z<br />Indianapolis, IN 46249-0301</p>

<p>2. NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION: The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a limited source acquisition in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (b) (2). "Limited source" in this case pertains to the award of a single logical follow-on task order for the continuation of DCIP systems support to DFAS. The provision for a logical follow-on can be found at 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C). DFARS 208.405-70(b)(2) provides for an exception as listed at FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property Administration Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies.<br />.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE: The Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to DoD missions. DCIP is directed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense) [ASD(HD)] and managed by the Mission Assurance Director. DFAS is tasked as the Financial Services Sector Lead Agent (one of 10 Defense Sectors under DoD). In addition, OASD(HD) ensures that related DoD and national programs supporting critical infrastructure protection are leveraged effectively. To accomplish these objectives, the vendor under contract to DFAS, ASD(HD) and the Mission Assurance Director has established a support matrix throughout DoD to ensure an integrated effort that leverages expertise outside of the core staff. The contractor performs work to develop and maintain policy, procedures and guidance related to DCIP; which develops and maintains characterization of the Financial Services sector functions, systems, assets and dependencies; collaborates with other Defense Sector Lead Agents and DoD Components to identify cross-sector interdependencies; analyzes the Financial Services Sector capabilities and develops a prioritized list of critical assets; and provides recommendations for remediation or mitigation of the Financial Services Sector related risks to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense &amp; Americas' Security Affairs).The contractor will continue to support DFAS's Financial Services Sector Lead Agent role in achieving these objectives.<br /><br />The contract will be a one-year bridge contract awarded as a logical follow-on to the task orders from the BPA to allow the transition from contractor to in-house fulfillment of the mission requirements. The estimated cost for the contract is $XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.</p>
<p>4. RATIONALE AND PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The DCIP program was initiated and funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense who named DFAS as the Lead Agent for the Financial Services Sector. Because DCIP was new and DFAS did not have the personnel or expertise to complete the mission, a contract was sought. At that time, the potential contract was competed within the GSA community of vendors and had 3 responses. Just last year, critical Microsoft Security standards were added to the requirements for all personnel working on the program.<br />A 5-year BPA (HQ0423-07-A-0007) was written against GSA Schedule contract XXXXXXXXXXX(Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.) for a total contract value of $XXXXXXXXXXXX. The last of 6 Task Orders were written on that BPA on 9 January 2012 to fulfill a continuing need to provide support of the DCIP program. <br />Six years ago, DFAS was able to meet it's needs with IT experts in database and systems. However, in the last 6 years, the personnel engaged in the DFAS DCIP operation have developed unique knowledge and expertise and working relationships with all the agencies and 65 DCIP partners throughout DoD. There are also multiple remediation projects in various stages of completion. The contractor has developed the unique knowledge and expertise to perform the tasks in support of the DFAS Lead Agent role, serving the entire Department of Defense.<br />This mission is critical and has undergone a not-quite-completed Business Case Analysis (BCA) to determine if it should be brought in-house. Note that the DCIP Program Office was required to identify the personnel and training requirements to complete the transition. Their analysis noted that they would require a three-month overlap to bring a new staff up-to- speed with the program as it is today.<br />That information makes it critical to put in place a bridge contract. We expect the mission to be brought in-house within the next year. It will take a three-month hands-on training process to effectively transition to another team. Therefore, it would degrade the mission and create a significant additional financial burden to compete the contract in the open market now, pay for and extension to allow the current contractor to transition a new staff, then go through the whole transition process again 6 months. later. <br />Therefore, best action from DFAS is to put in place a Logical Follow-on, one-year bridge contract to allow the BCA process to be completed and the individuals hired and trained so that this mission can continue.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE: The award of the initial task order for DFAS DCIP Support was competed on GSA e-Buy under GSA SIN 874-1, MISSION ORIENTED BUSINESS INTEGRATED SERVICES (MOBIS) -Consulting Services. All interested offerors within this GSA SIN of 1,710 vendors had the opportunity to respond to the RFQ. Three quotes were received and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. (BAH) was awarded the BPA on a Best Value basis. This requirement will be awarded to BAH in accordance with 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C)); the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY: Some inquiries were made and it is clear that the current team has information, processes and knowledge that are unique to the DFAS DCIP mission so no other firm can perform the mission without a significant transition. This is a Logical Follow-on to bridge from contractor provided to government employee provided support. This Logical Follow-on will allow a smooth transition of the functions to government employees.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: This order must be issued on a limited-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a five-year BPA effectively accomplished by the incumbent. The use of a logical follow-on is justified because the same work requiring significant expertise is continuing and there is a continuing need for the same level of DCIP support during the transition. The inclusion of priced options was not considered since the bridge contract cannot be extended beyond the one-year time frame.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: DFAS-DCIP intends to in-source this effort at the end of the one-year period of performance of this contract. Thus, additional contract awards are not anticipated.</p>

<DESC>The Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (GCTT) has a requirement to conduct a tech refresh to install the current, fielded CDT software version and replace obsolete hardware with new, present day technology as cited in the Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP).  A tech refresh will also maintain commonality, compatibility and interoperability across the current CDT product line.  This allows the CDT/SV to remain capable of sustaining training.
