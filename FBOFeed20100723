<CONTACT>Lynn G. White, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-4996, Fax (315) 330-8120, Email Lynn.White@rl.af.mil
<DESC><br />
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Cross Domain Innovation &amp; Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate is interested in new innovative technologies and capabilities that promote the state of the art for secure, accreditable capabilities to enhance the sharing of information between multiple independent security domains.</p>
<p>General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs:</p>
<p>- Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Multiple Level Security technologies: MILS &amp; MLS technologies are operating systems or equivalents which allow for trustworthy handling of data at different classifications. These are often core functionalities utilized in cross domain solutions. Examples of MILS systems include Green Hills "Integrity" Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), Linux Works LynxOS, or Wind River's offerings. Examples of MLS operating systems include Trusted Solaris 10 with Trusted Extensions, or Security Enhanced Linux (SE-Linux).</p>
<p>- Object level auditing: Modern auditing is typically performed on specific events, such as accessing a new process, potential modification point, etc. This tends to lead to massive amounts of audit data, some with little or no security relevance. An alternate approach is to have data objects be capable of recognizing appropriately auditable events - creation, deletion, copying, etc - and report their occurrence to some centralized service(s). Such an effort would face an extreme amount of validation requirements to be accreditable.</p>
<p>- Policy-based configuration and management: Most modern systems are typically configured independently, leading to difficulty in reconfiguring a network of multiple systems to handle an overarching change. Additionally, most are directly configured, rather than being dynamically reactive to policy changes. Having systems being both centrally configured and reactive to policy changes could greatly reduce the administrative overhead of such systems. On the management side, the Government must be able to represent policies for access to system resources electronically, allowing for a simple policy change to affect the configuration of systems and networks in a highly assured manner.</p>
<p>- Workflow Enforcement: Most systems are good at maintaining a workflow within their capabilities. However, few systems are easily adaptable to enforce new workflows across multiple systems, maintaining non-repudiation and auditability across each step. Solutions that allow for adaptable workflows will greatly improve system flexibility and reactivity to changes when needed.<br /><br />- Redaction: The ability to modify an information flow (either in limited formats or optimally in any format) to remove information inappropriate to its destination. The ultimate goal would be a system capable of automatically preventing inadvertent or malicious release of inappropriate information while not restricting the appropriate sharing of information. Further challenges include determining the point at which redaction removes the value of transmitting any resulting information, which if successful would reduce the bandwidth &amp; processing requirements for cross domain solutions.</p>
<p>- Data Trust: Being able to assure that the content (&lsquo;data') matches the labels and metadata associated with it. This is a dual task. The system must assure an appropriate linkage between specific data and metadata by automated inspection wherever possible and human inspection where automation is infeasible. It must also allow for highly-trusted validation mechanisms to reduce the computational overhead, while still fulfilling the certification and accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>- Improved/Reliable Human Review (RHR): Increasing the speed and efficiency of the human review process required on transfer of most information from a higher classification domain to a lower classification domain. Methods are expected to be highly variable, from full machine comprehension to statistical techniques that aid the reviewer. Example tools needed to improve the RHR process include: identifying, revealing and/or cleansing of hidden content; data security labeling verification; data owner/data steward identity verification; pedigree representation; cognitive text analysis and many others.</p>
<p>- Enterprise Common Operational Picture (COP): An awareness of challenges, risks and problems to an enterprise is critical to being able to respond appropriately to react to enterprise events including load balancing, fail over and matching of appropriate device based on information to be shared. As such, a Common Operational Picture (COP) or dashboard environment is required to measure environmental factors of all machines within the enterprise so that an appropriate reaction can be made to quickly adapt to the changes needed. Note that there are non-trivial operational and need-to-know issues involved.</p>
<p>- Service management: Given the growing interest in and support of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in the various domains, improving the management of such resources becomes increasingly urgent. Adding in the desire of many customers to form &lsquo;mashable' (data rapidly adaptable by users) interfaces to critical data sources via SOA, this management requirement becomes even more critical. Additional concerns come into play when these single-domain SOA-based enterprises begin incorporating cross domain solutions. Thus, determining the risks to one or more cross-domain solutions as provided by such &lsquo;mashable' interfaces' capabilities becomes an urgent concern. This can also be known as &lsquo;service orchestration'.</p>
<p>- Label Integrity &amp; Classification: Being able to appropriately and securely label information is an early precursor to flattening the networks. As such, the integrity of the labels - especially classification &amp; releasability labels at a bare minimum - is critical in the long run. Various methods are being researched for this, from authoritative information servers to various cryptographic binding methods, and including other approaches.</p>
<p>- Data Aggregation &amp; Attestation: A classic concern with automated data handling is the data aggregation issue, also referred to as the &lsquo;sources and methods' problem. That is, a document made up of multiple pieces of information may end up with a final classification higher than any of its constituent parts. Finding methods to assure this does not happen within automated, adaptable services is a major challenge. Further, finding automated or automatable methods to validate and attest that it has not occurred increase the level of difficulty.</p>
<p>- Trustworthy labeling tools &amp; services: Given the importance of appropriate labeling of data in a flattened networking environment, the tools to add labeling to data become very important targets of malicious users. Finding ways to assure that the labeling is correct and not maliciously applied or reapplied becomes critical.</p>
<p>- Identity management: Maintaining track of who has access to what resources is a non-trivial, but mostly understood challenge within a single domain. When this capability is extended into a cross domain environment, many critical issues immediately arise and make what seems reasonably solvable in a single domain quite thorny. Examples include need-to-know issues, such as: Do low-side users need to know about high-side users? When and why and how do you allow only appropriate information flows? How and when do accounts getting locked in one domain affect account(s) in other domains?</p>
<p>- Storage of sensitive data with multiple owners: Given the focus of centralization of capabilities currently ongoing within the various communities (Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs), Regional Service Centers (RSCs), etc., the issue of sensitive information owned by multiple disparate organizations being collocated on a single device becomes a potential showstopper. Finding ways to protect the need to know of the information at a level acceptable to all the various data owners in question becomes a very difficult problem, especially when you add in the modern need-to-share requirements.</p>
<p>- Secure non-hierarchical data sharing: The Bell-LaPadula concepts (&lsquo;write up, read down') work extremely well for hierarchical separation schemes, such as with classification. However, there are many non-hierarchical separation schemes in use across the various domains - releasability, caveats and code words can all be examples of non-hierarchical classification schemes. What are the equivalents of Bell-LaPadula's concepts in such non-hierarchical information spaces?</p>
<p>- Appropriate discovery and subscription to data flows in other domains: A common theme across academic approaches to web services and SOA is discovery - sharing information about how to get information. This is a great advantage to the transfer of information, but the common, open standards typically used are completely insecure. To allow for discovery of services in trusted networks, there must be some level of need-to-know enforcement built into the standard academic discovery approaches.</p>
<p>- Disadvantaged (&lsquo;tactical') user support: The Tactical user is unable to handle the information load expected within the enterprise, as they are typically limited to the computer hardware they can carry or have mounted to a vehicle. Yet these users are still in need of many of the enterprises' data feeds, and are the ultimate reason for those enterprises' existence. How do we link these users back into the enterprises, given the challenges on weight, power, bandwidth, and effective time? (Would you rather have a soldier on the front lines performing administrative tasks, or fighting?)</p>
<p>- Cross domain enterprise management: This area investigates quality of service (QOS) in different security domain being handled at the transfer device improving enterprise information sharing. This area identifies ways to achieve greater mission assurance by enabling Cross Domain content review mechanisms to be efficiently adapted to changes in information assurance and mission policies. To achieve this, a Cross-Domain content review architecture supporting expandable set of service-based data filters and a data flow orchestration mechanism responsive to policy changes must be defined, leveraged and/or developed.</p>
<p>- Secure Information Sharing - In order to prevent malicious insider and outsider threats to the many different security domains, within a Cross Domain System (CDS), Technology that improves/enhances cyber capabilities via assured isolation &amp; mitigation of high concern threats, covert channels, and other defensive cyber capabilities within cross domain environments must be developed. In doing so, balance among the three legs of the CIA Triad; Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability must be maintained.</p>
<p>- Next Generation Data Services: As SOAs move towards secure Cloud Computing within a Global Information Grid environment, the research, analysis, and assembly of appropriate secured services is required to ensure that data within this environment is trustworthy, reliable, readily available to the appropriate parties, protected from unauthorized parties, timely, and accurate. This area seeks to identify, select, implement and test various services against the metrics identified above and develop a prototype solution that fuses these capabilities into an accreditable prototype solution.</p>
<p>- Advance Trusted Computing Technologies: Advance the state of the art in trusted computing technologies though active research of commercial companies and technologies to determine what trusted computing technologies are on the market today. Once identified, this area will assist in defining a Technology Roadmap and Trusted Computing Strategy based on those findings and investigate the identified trusted computing architectures, looking at ways to modify and improve architectures for operational use. After analysis is complete, the development and population of a test-bed of trusted computing technologies for testing security, functionality, and performance of modified systems can be created and a strategic marketing and outreach execution which impacts commercial development of Trusted Computing products and services of selected candidates provided that is based on the test results.</p>
<p>Focus Areas for FY11:</p>
<p>Reputation Based Access Control:<br />- Given a large corpus of pedigree metadata currently being investigated as a means of improving data sharing, it should be possible and practical to determine (via data mining &amp; graph analysis techniques) acknowledged authoritative sources for data. This would allow systems to determine 'considered good' sources as a ground-truth indication for future data release. In addition, a formal model of behavior should be used, based on event structures for specifying properties of past behavior; and providing efficient dynamic algorithms for checking whether a particular behavior satisfies a particular property. This would increase users' confidence in information integrity and appropriateness through the measurement of quality of information (QOI).</p>
<p>Automated Security Annotation &amp; Safeguarding:<br />- Expanding the ability of cognitive-based assistants to improve cross domain information sharing to fulfill the "human-in-the-loop gap" is a significant challenge that needs to be resolved for well understood data types. This would include working with accreditors to build a body of evidence regarding the trustworthiness of cognitive automated annotation and safeguarding procedures. The end goal is to create accreditable systems with known and accepted probabilities of success for the labeling and sharing of information between different security domains.</p>
<p>Focus Areas for FY12:</p>
<p>Cognitive support for discourse level analysis:<br />- Using innovative techniques to enhance the sharing of documents between multiple security domains, there is an additional need to expand the capability beyond single documents and create machine comprehension of multiple documents. This is useful in &lsquo;chatroom' and many other multiple-person interaction collaboration formats. As a bonus these techniques may be able to detect phishing/social engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Automation of RHR: <br />- RHR remains a continual bottleneck for the efficient sharing of information between multiple security domains. In order to improve sharing, the need exists to automate, as much as feasible, tools to cognitively analyze the documents and messages being transferred in order to make an effective decision. This capability must prove to be highly reliable and accurate with a proven ability to substantially reduce the number of false positive and false negative responses. The solution must take into account the Information Assurances aspects of the capability so that the tools can be extended into an accreditable automated RHR capability.</p>
<p>Focus Areas for FY13:</p>
<p>Brokering authoritative trust within multiple security domains: <br />- Investigate and develop innovative mechanisms for the development of multi-domain authentication and authorization services. Currently, there are many single domain mechanisms for single domains that cannot be used for multi-domain brokering due to information assurance issues with trust. There is a need to determine how best to leverage those single-domain solutions to allow for trust between different security domains. This trust obviously cannot be cryptographically secured, and due to concerns of operational security should obscure to a large degree the domain that the information that the trust is being based upon is being drawn from.</p>
<p>Key Terms:</p>
<p>Secure: The solutions must be highly resistant to inappropriate use, either deliberate or accidental.</p>
<p>Accreditable: The solutions must be able to pass appropriate accreditation procedures, such as DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/3, and/or the emerging National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) 8500 standards in its final form. (Systems will not need to be immediately accredited, but must make all reasonable efforts to retain the ability to be accredited via best practices and good security design, such as Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA's) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) series, National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST)'s Special Publication 800-53v3, and other appropriate guidance.)</p>
<p>Need to Know: Not every user will necessarily be allowed access to every potential resource. Solutions must have appropriate measures to allow enforcement of access policies.</p>
<p>Sharing: Information handled through these solutions must be able to be easily shared with appropriate personnel and/or systems. This typically requires adherence to published data, security, infrastructure and interoperability standards such as those available from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) among others. In general, solutions should be capable of interacting appropriately via SOA/web service means.</p>
<p>Independent Security Domains: By default, each level of classification is required to run on physically separated infrastructures. Cross-domain solutions are the bridges between these infrastructures, and hence require an exceedingly detailed security analysis and risk identification.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24 M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 11 - $8M; FY 12 - $8M; FY 13 - $8M.

<p>ATTN: Michael J. Mayhew <br />AFRL/RIEBB<br />CDIS BAA: BAA-10-09-RIKA<br />525 Brooks Road<br />Rome, NY 13441-4505</p>
<p>Electronic submission to Michael.Mayhew@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the degree of innovation for the approach and the use of innovative modern architectures in development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; the use of analysis, metrics &amp; testing and adherence to Information Assurance and Cross-Domain Certification &amp; Accreditation requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness, Maturity &amp; Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Reliability and Robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Government may use the services of MITRE in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals. The exclusive responsibility for evaluation and selection/non-selection of proposals remains with the Government. Representatives of the foregoing firm participating in the evaluation process will be precluded from submitting a white paper/proposal under this BAA, and will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. Any objection to the use of any or all of the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a secret or top secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to secret or top secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Michael J. Mayhew<br />Telephone: (315) 330-2898 <br />Email: michael.mayhew@rl.af.mil</p>

<CONTACT>Ruth Makela ruth.makela.ctr@randolph.af.mil

<a href="mailto:ruth.makela.ctr@randolph.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>554 ELGS/PNK formally announces the intent to award a sole source task order FA8734-10-F-0011 Government & Retirement Benefits, Inc. (GRB), under GSA contract GS-35F-0047S Schedule 70 for approximately $990,544.02; basic performance period and four 1 year options.  To meet mission requirements, the objective of this acquisition is for the subscription of software for the Employee Benefits Information System (EBIS) eTraining module. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(1), Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work Support requires the continuation (renewal) of the current e EBIS eTraining license, as an integrated module within the current EBIS system, for 146,0013 users and consists of the following seminars: 1) Pre-retirement: The Thrift Savings Plan Open Elections Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-469) required the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop and i! mplement a retirement financial literacy and education strategy for Federal employees as part of the retirement training offered by OPM under 5 U.S.C. 8350 to educate Federal employees on the need for retirement savings and investment; how to plan for retirement; and how to calculate retirement investment needed to meet their retirement goals. Each agency is required to develop a retirement financial education plan and strategy on how to provide retirement financial education to their employees. The solution to reach 100% of the AF serviced population (new employees, mid-career employees, and employees close to retirement) was to purchase the Benefit eSeminars;  2) Financial Literacy: targets new, mid-career, and pre-retirement employees 00 valid need; 35,069 FERS employees (29% of FERS employees) contributing less than 5% to TSP; and 3) New Employee Benefits Orientation: Approximately 7,000 employees hired each year; Civilian Personnel Sections (CPS) do not consistently pr! ovide benefits information - many new employees miss benefit opportunities.  The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b) (1), Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work The EBIS e-Training software license is considered highly specialized and is an embedded module within the EBIS application subscription already in use by Air Force. The software product subscription and the data rights are solely owned by GRB and cannot be purchased. The period of time required to perform a source selection as well as the ramp-up time required for a new contractor to customize software to meet the requirements would cause an unacceptable schedule delay and a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The basic period of performance is one (1) year and four (4) one-year options. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the cont! racting officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offers, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, a! nd/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. In addition AFFARS 5352.201-9101, OMBUDSMAN, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.  This will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.<BR><BR>The United States Army, National Capital Region Contracting Center (NCRCC), intends to award a single 1 year (with four optional one-year periods) Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract for Project Directorate Reserve Component Automation System (PD RCAS) and Product Directorate Army Human Resource System (PD AHRS) for Information Technology (IT) Support Services.  This is 100% Small Business Set-aside, Best Value acquisition. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541519, size standard is $25 million, and the Federal Supply Code (FSC) is 7045.  <BR><BR>The RCAS is an automated information system that provides the Army the capability to administer, manage, and mobilize Army Guard and Reserve forces more effectively.  Over fifty percent of the Army's force structure is in the Reserve Component. Existing information management systems in the Army National Guard (ARNG) and United States Army Reserve (USAR) are not integrated, are limited in capability and functionality, and require excessive time and manpower to operate and maintain.  The RCAS provides an integrated capability that supports mobilization and improves day-to-day administration and management of Reserve and Guard forces.  RCAS links approximately 10,500 Guard and Reserve units at approximately 4,000 sites located in all 50 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia.  The United States Army is sustaining the Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) to fulfill long-standing plans to improve the operational readiness of the Reserve Component (Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve) portion of the total force.  The RCAS supports the decision-making needs of all commanders, staffs, and functional managers responsible for Reserve Component forces. <BR> <BR>The RCAS provides state-of-the-art office automation, telecommunications, distributed databases, and distributed processing capabilities to provide timely and accurate information to plan, prepare, and execute mobilization and to improve the accomplishments of routine administrative tasks.

<DESC>This posting constitutes West Point Military Academy, West Point, NY notice of intent to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Newsgator Technologies, Inc., 950 17th St Ste 2500, Denver, CO 80202 for the continued development of MilSpace to customize the platform for maximum impact in the military domain.  The baseline technology platform is provided by Newsgator, Inc.  formerly Tomoye, Inc. The software is proprietary to Newsgator Technologies.  The period of performance is for one year.  The total award amount is estimated to be $320,000. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) - deemed available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts. The applicable NAICS code is 541511. Newsgator, Inc. provides the technology platform that U.S. Army professional forums are powered on. The company has unique and proprietary knowledge that is required to effectively develop the custom capabilities required and to then integrate those custom developments into the platform seamlessly.  This becomes even more important considering that the company is in an ongoing and continuous process of future development.  Moreover, CALDOL has a research and development function with a requirement to share custom technology development with the Battle Command Knowledge System (BCKS) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Because the BCKS online communities are also built on the Newsgator product, it is critical that the technology features and capabilities CALDOL develops integrate seamlessly inside the Newsgator system.  In summary, the work CALDOL requires must be done by the company that is already providing the basic service.  They have the expertise and unique knowledge that will give us the best product, which will also seamlessly integrate with the product in its future state. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. No solicitation will be available. Interested parties may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the designated representative. Response to this notice must be received within two (2) calendar days of the date of this notice via email. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, upon receipt of this notice, is solely at the discretion of the Government in accordance with FAR 13.106(b).

<DESC>The Runway Safety Area (RSA) Sterilization initiative requires the FAA to replace all non-frangible structures in the RSA to frangible structures.
The purpose of this announcement is to publish the FAA's intent to award a single source contract to Jaquith Industries Inc., Syracuse, NY for Low Impact Resistant (LIR) Structures and Ancillary Equipment.  This contract will also be used to supplement the inventory at the FAA Logistics Center for future projects.
Jaquith Industries Inc. currently provides LIR structures and ancillary equipment for the National Air Space.  Jaquith will deliver LIR structures and all supporting equipment to the FAA Logistics Center in Oklahoma City, OK.  Jaquith' structures have a definitive base compatible with FAA's base structures currently installed at various airports.  Due to schedule and budget constraints, the FAA does not have the resources or time to construct new concrete bases required to accommodate a new design structure. 
This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information/market survey, nor will reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding.  
Written questions or comments must be received by the Contracting Officer at Vickie.gordon@faa.gov and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representatives at renee.williams@faa.gov and ammyanna.williams@faa.gov by 4:00 local time on August 9, 2010.

<DESC>This project is being advertised on a unrestricted "full and open" basis.

PROJECT DETAILS

This project is located within Tonto National Forest between Apache Junction, AZ and Roosevelt Dam.  Apache Trail (SR88/FH49) is a designated scenic byway and historic road that travels some of the most rugged terrain in Arizona.  This unpaved road varies from 12 to 22 feet in width.

The project consists of 5 separate sites within a 2 mile stretch near Fish Creek Canyon, between Tortilla Flats and Apache Lake.  Access to the project sites will be from both the west (Apache Junction/Tortilla Flats) and east (SR88/SR188 intersection).  Planning and staging of the work between the 5 sites will be critical to successfully complete the work in the limited timeframe.  In addition, this project requires technical expertise in compaction grouting, as well as specialized stone masonry work.  A description of each project site and approximate quantities is as follows:

Wall 1 work consists of compaction grouting, stone masonry wall repairs, and drainage work.  Wall 1 will require approximately 22 cubic yards of cement grout, 190 linear feet of grout piping, 8 square yards of stone masonry repair, 70 square yards of clay ditch liner, 100 linear feet of ditch reconditioning, and 10 cubic yards of grouted riprap.

Wall 2 work consists of construction of a 6 to 18 high reinforced concrete retaining wall with stone masonry facing and drainage work.  Wall 2 will require approximately 2,700 square feet of retaining wall, 300 square yards of stone masonry facing, and 250 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

Wall 3 work consists of compaction grouting, stone masonry wall repairs, and drainage work.  Wall 3 will require approximately 100 cubic yards of cement grout, 1000 linear feet of grout piping, 50 square yards of stone masonry repair, and 200 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

Site 1 work consists of construction of an 8 high reinforced concrete retaining wall, a reinforced soil slope, and selective tree clearing.  Wall at Site 1 will require approximately 2,300 square feet of retaining wall.  Reinforced soil slope at Site 1 will require 430 square yards of geogrid, 170 cubic yards of excavation, and 170 cubic yards of unclassified borrow.

Site 2 work consists of construction of a 10 to 13 high reinforced soil slope and drainage work.  Site 2 will require approximately 1,500 square yards of geogrid, 450 cubic yards of excavation, 450 cubic yards of unclassified borrow, 40 cubic yards of riprap, and 100 linear feet of ditch reconditioning.

In addition to the main roadway work, there will be temporary traffic control, construction surveying, temporary erosion control, and contractor testing.
It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in mid July, 2010 with construction occurring from October 2010 to January 2011.

Estimated cost $1.5 to $3.5 million.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106(b), the Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office is negotiating a sole source award to CIMtech Inc., 901 Algona Blvd. N., Ste. B, Algona, WA 98001, for the purchase of a Dimension SST 1200es FDM printer for approximately $44,000.
This is a fused deposition modeling three dimensional printer that uses ASS thermoplastic for the printing medium. No other technology or company has been found that produces three dimensional printers that use the fused deposition method. The fused deposition method means the printer melts (fuses) the thermoplastic as it is printing.  
In addition to the three dimensional printer using fused deposition method, its final product must be able to be drilled, tapped, heat stake threaded, and be semi-flexural for snap interconnecting parts without being brittle and breaking and have no post curing.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date and time.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to CIMtech Inc.  Responses are due by August 6, 2010, 3:00 p.m. (MT).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>GENERAL:The US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), Quinault National Fish Hatchery (NFH), 3 Sockeye Road, Humptulips, WA 98552 has 24 concrete rearing ponds. 
These ponds were constructed in 1970 and are now 40 years old.  The concrete walls and floors are pressure washed numerous times every year and the surface of the concrete has eroded and become very rough and detrimental to aquaculture.  
The Quinault NFH has limited funds this year and is only able to fund the resurfacing of two rearing ponds. This resurfacing will extend the life of the ponds by at least 15 years.  This hybrid elastomeric coating has been applied to several Service hatcheries (e.g. Dworshak, Carson, & Warm Springs NFHs). 
Scope:Project is estimated at $5.20/sf. Based on a square footage per pond of 2624 sf. the amount would be $27,289.50 to cover two ponds.  Weather and hatchery timeline for production will allow sufficient dry days for the coating of the ponds without the need for heat and tenting expenses on top of the above estimate. Specifications include an epoxy primer and urethane thickness of 120 mil average. 
DEFINITIONS:  Hybrid Elastomeric Coating: Products and specifications have just been adopted by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. ICS have 20 years of application, development and testing.  ICS has coated more hatcheries than all the others combined. 
PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Rearing ponds will available for coating on August 2, weather permitting.  Project should be completed by the end of August to take advantage of dry weather.  
Project is located at:Quinault National Fish Hatchery3 Sockeye RoadHumptulips, WA 98552

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The Fremont Winema National Forest is requiring upgrades&nbsp;to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3</span></strong> existing remote weather stations located throughout the Fremont-Winema National Forest. The RAWS (Remote Automatic Weather Station) Depot at NIFC (National Interagency Fire Center) supplies the maintenance program for our network of RAWS. All of the sensors on the RAWS are required to be replaced at intervals of annually, two or three years, depending on the sensor. The Depot refurbishes and recalibrates these sensors for us in addition to providing technical and maintenance support, trouble shooting and system monitoring. Only FTS products will be supported by the RAWS Depot. Any other supplier's products would require a maintenance agreement that would be an additional expense over and above the current Depot agreements. The extensive network of RAWS locations requires not only annual maintenance but parts upgrades to support improving technology and higher quality weather data for Wildland firefighter and public safety. Maintaining consistency between weather stations models within the fire organization is crucial to our mission for interagency and interoperability and safety. The Government intends to award a contract for this requirement. The suggested contractor is <strong>FOREST TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS LTD, 1065 HENRY ENG PLACE, VICTORIA, BC, V9B 6-B2.</strong> This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they may meet these requirements may submit in writing, within 10 calendar days of this notification, complete information describing the ability to meet these requirements. Information will be used solely for purposes of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Maria Gonzalez mgonzalez@fs.fed.us not later than 12 noon, Pacific Standard Time, August 2, 2010. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. IAW FAR 5.202(a)(6), this acquisition will be ordered against an existing IDIQ contract under a GSA schedule and no other offers will be solicited for this requirement. IAW FAR 8.404(a), placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. A determination will be made by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable. The requirement items are commercially available therefore existing market forces support the cost reasonableness determination. <strong>The prices quoted are based on GSA Contract GS-07F-9253S.</strong> Per FAR 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Market research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedules. Market research indicates that while the FTS supplies are not unique for all equipment or all parts but they are compatible with the weather stations. <br />This is the only source available to purchase the required components and meet the delivery requirements of the agency. It was determined that no other FSS vendor has all parts and equipment or services on schedule that matches, has interconnectivity to, and is compatible with the existing requirements of the weather stations. This requirement is not available for "full and open competition" based on the need for these services in maintaining the integrity of the unit and delivery time. The use of FTS items and services is essential to program requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product or obtaining services by another company. Acquisition of a different brand would cause incompatibility with the existing component stations, delay in awarding, and not meeting delivery requirement with the process of testing the integrity of other manufactures parts or equipment to these propriety components would directly impact the Fire Program and have significant effects on firefighter and public safety.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior is in the process of procuring three used Boeing 737-400 aircraft in support of National Nuclear Security Administration mission requirements. As a part of this requirement, the NNSA requires the aircraft be configured in a "combi" configuration capable of hauling both passengers and cargo during the same flights. This announcement serves as notification of the U.S. Department of the Interior's intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Pemco World Air Services, Inc from Tampa, FL (previously Dothan, AL) for the modification to used Boeing 737-400 aircraft using STC  ST03387AT with a rear airstair into the combi configuration in support of NNSA mission requirements. The first aircraft is anticipated to be delivered to the company so that the modification can begin by January 2011. The justification to negotiate on a sole source basis Pemco World Air Services is attached below.All reasonable sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation by the closing date of this announcement which shall be considered by the Agency. There will be no solicitation issued with this announcement, and interested parties shall contact the contracting Officer at 208-433-5027 or Michael_mcfarlane@nbc.gov for additional information on these requirements. The following Justification follows the content requirements of FAR Part 6.Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) - Modification of up to Three Boeing 737-400 Aircraft to a Combi Configuration 1.	The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), National Business Center (NBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), Boise Branch, plans to contract by means of other than full and open competition, for the modification of up to three (3) used Boeing 737-400 aircraft from a passenger configuration to a combi configuration with rear airstair, in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Secure Transportation (OST), Program Office for Aviation Operations (POAO). This document sets forth the justification and approval for the use of other than full and open competition for the Sole Source Procurement of the services as identified within.2.	In support of the NNSA, AQD intends to procure services from Pemco World Air Services, a U.S. company headquartered in Tampa, Florida, to modify up to three (3) 737-400 aircraft from a passenger configuration to a combi configuration using Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) ST03387AT with rear airstair.  This justification is to support the negotiation of a Sole Source contract for modification of these aircraft from a passenger configuration to a combi configuration using the above Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) STC. An STC is a supplemental type certificate issued when an applicant has received FAA approval to modify an aircraft from its original type design. The STC, which incorporates by reference the related Type Certificate (TC), approves not only the modification but also how that modification affects the original design. Modifications to aircraft must be approved by the FAA with an STC, an FAA Field Approval issued by Form 337, or both, in order to possess an FAA Certificate of Airworthiness. 
3.	The NNSA has a statutory requirement to transport armed Federal agents to and from convoy locations, and nuclear emergency responders to and from accident and incident sites throughout the United States and potentially overseas.  Federal and contract employees aboard these flights carry automatic weapons and grenade launchers, as well as significant amounts of mission-required pyrotechnics, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials (hazmat) and specialized cargo. Carriage of passengers, hazmat, explosives, and pyrotechnics in the same aircraft is strictly prohibited in civil aircraft.  The Government conducts these missions as public use aircraft and mitigates passenger risk to the maximum extent possible; however, even after implementing the most-rigorous risk mitigation procedures, NNSA cannot protect its employees and contractors from cargo fires or from fumes emitting from hazardous materials in an aircraft where the passengers and cargo share the same cabin space without bulkhead separation. 
In order to fulfill the NNSA mission requirements above, the aircraft must be capable of carrying both passengers and cargo in the main cabin at the same time, in such as the combi configuration. The combi is a modification that converts a regular passenger aircraft main cabin into two separate compartments; cargo and passenger.  The compartments are separated by a barrier wall (bulkhead) which isolates the passenger section of the main cabin from any possible fire and/or toxic chemicals carried in the cargo compartment area.  The combi cargo compartment is sealed from the passenger compartment and incorporates very effective halon fire extinguishers. Note: Halon displaces air and is not allowed in closed compartments like airplanes where people are present.  The cargo compartment is designed to vent to the exterior of the aircraft allowing halon discharge, noxious fumes, toxic chemicals, and carcinogens to flow overboard, thus protecting passengers. The Boeing 737-400 airframe combi is compliant with all 14 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) and 49 CFR requirements.  This is critical to the safety of aviation and NNSA personnel as they conduct their challenging Governmental mission.  Pemco World Air Services has the only FAA STC to convert the Boeing 737-400 from a passenger configuration to a combi configuration and there are no other known Boeing 737-400 combi conversions in the world.
The estimated price of the combi modification and aft airstair installation is $(redacted) per aircraft, for a total estimated contract value of $(redacted) for up to three aircraft. 
4.	The authority used to justify this procurement of other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c).  No supplier other than Pemco World Air Services has an FAA-approved combi modification to the Boeing 737-400 airframe. 
5.	AMD and NNSA have reviewed the list of FAA STC's, and the only approved STC to convert a Boeing 737-400 aircraft from a passenger configured aircraft to a combi configured aircraft is the Pemco World Air Services' STC ST03387AT. 
Therefore, the intent of this justification is to receive approval to negotiate a contract on a Sole Source basis with Pemco World Air Services for the modification of up to three (3) Boeing 737-400 aircraft from passenger configured aircraft to a combi configured aircraft with rear airstairs. 
6.	 Market Survey: Market research was conducted by AMD through search of the FAA database for FAA STCs on Boeing 737-400 aircraft.  AMD also contacted The Boeing Company and they confirmed that the Pemco World Air Services is the only holder of an FAA-Approved STC for the conversion, and Pemco World Air Services holds the only STC available for the conversion of the Boeing 737-400 aircraft from a passenger configured aircraft to a combi configured aircraft. The Pre-Solicitation Announcement will be posted on the Government Point of Entry (GPE) for a minimum of 15 days consistent with the requirements of FAR Subpart 5.203(a), even though Commercial Items procedures allow for less time. Should World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreements or Free Trade Agreements be applicable, the announcement will be posted for a period of 40 days in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.203 (h).  The synopsis will include the required content described in FAR Subpart 5.207 and specifically items (14) that identifies the intended source, with a statement of reason justifying the lack of competition and (15)(ii) that requires a statement that all responsible sources may submit a capabilities proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. 
7.	The Contracting Officer will employ the practices of price analysis as identified in FAR Subpart 15.404-1(b) to determine that prices are considered to be fair and reasonable. Award will not be made without assurance that the prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
8.	Market research was conducted by searching the FAA website for STC's on the Boeing 737-400 aircraft, contacting various major airframe modification companies, informal discussions with large transport aircraft operators, and finally by confirming with The Boeing Company that Pemco World Air Services is the only STC holder for combi conversions on Boeing 737-400s. A significant amount of material is available and printed for the file; however, information related to this justification consisted of attempting to locate current FAA STCs for the combi modification.  In addition, we contacted companies that perform major airframe modifications to large transport aircraft to see if it would feasible to develop a new Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to modify the Boeing 737-400 airframe to make them capable of carrying both passenger and hazardous cargo at the same time. The response was that not only would it not be cost-effective to develop the STC, it would most likely take years to develop. 
9.	At this time, Pemco World Air Services holds the only FAA-approved STC for converting the Boeing 737-400 aircraft from a passenger configured aircraft to a combi configured aircraft.  To allow someone to attempt to create and approve another combi conversion would be time-consuming, costly, and risky to the NNSA program. 
10.	The following companies have contacted the AMD in writing and indicated that they are interested in the requirement to modify 737-400s to a combi configuration:a.	(redacted)b.	Pemco World Air Services
11.	The synopsis will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunity website, and should another responsible company respond that has the capability to perform the combi modification and obtain the required FAA approval, we will evaluate the capability and determine whether or not to remove the sole sources status and compete the requirement. 
12.	I hereby certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Ick Young Kim, 102-201 Walkerhill Village, 383 Kwangjang-dong, Kwangjin-ku, Seoul 143-811, Korea, for the services as outlined below: 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-232-DDC. 

Background Information
Chronic bacterial infections have been to shown to cause cancer via unknown mechanisms.  Any bacterial product that interferes with signaling and results in the disruption of normal cell division and apoptosis could encourage tumor promotion.  Similarly, the ability to promote anchorage-independent growth could facilitate metatastic potential and lead to cancer progression.  One of the best-known toxic mechanisms with carcinogenic potential is the mitogenic toxin produced by some strains of Pasteurella multocida (PMT).  Toxigenic P. multocida has been isolated from chronic respiratory infections in humans.  PMT, a potent mitogen, enters cells, including fibroblasts, to stimulate G protein-dependent signaling pathways. In addition, mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), a key Ser-Thr kinase conserved from yeast to mammals, is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth, proliferation, and autophagy in a nutrient- and energy-responsive manner.  Investigators in the Laboratory of Biochemistry (LB) have shown that PMT induces protein and ATP synthesis in serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells via a G&#945;q-dependent activation of MEK and ERK1/2, and that in turn activates mTORC1, as monitored by the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein and inhibited by rapamycin. Thus, MT could serve as a model for elucidating the mechanism by which a bacterial toxin is involved in tumor promotion and/or cancer progression, as well as in normal signaling pathways mediated by mTOR.

Purpose and Objectives
The objective is to elucidate the biochemical pathways that mediate the various responses of fibroblasts to PMT treatment.  These include the mechanism underlying the anchorage-independent growth induced by transient treatment of PMT; PMT-induced mTOR activation that in turn phosphorylates PP2A, a protein phosphatase, at tyrosine 307 via a tyrosine kinase and results in its inactivation; and PMT-induced up-regulation of glucose transporter 1 protein via an mTOR-independent signaling pathway.  This will lead to studies of the effects of other physiologic factors on PMT-induced responses.  The Section on Metabolic Regulation in LB requires the immediate services of an expert cell biologist who has expertise in (1) enzymology, including those of protein tyrosine kinases and enzyme kinetics; (2) molecular biology, including techniques in protein overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis; and (3) protein chemistry, including techniques in protein purification and characterization.

Services to be Performed

General Requirments
Define optimal conditions for growth, PMT-induced effect on mTOR activation, proteins and ATP synthesis, and up-regulate glucose transporter 1 (Glut 1) protein.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PMT up-regulates this gene expression in serum-starved cells and to determine, using molecular biological techniques and biochemical methods, the role of Glut 1 in PMT-induced anchorage-independent proliferation. Investigate the tyrosine kinase downstream of mTOR that is responsible for phosphorylating PP2A, a protein phosphatase at tyrosine 307. 

Specific Requirements

The contractor must have an established record as an independent investigator, and as documented by publications in peer reviewed scientific journals. The contractor must be an expert in the field of biochemistry, molecular biological techniques, and biochemical methods to study the regulation and characterization of enzymes and an expert in enzyme activity assays, including those of protein tyrosine kinase.  

Contractor Requirements
The Contractor will perform experiments that involve growing Swiss 3T3 cells; setting up assays for enzymes participating in the signaling pathway mediating mTOR activation and PP2A inactivation that includes serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and protein synthesis machinery; carrying out siRNA methods to knockdown regulatory proteins; and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the residues involved.  

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
The Contractor is required to report the research findings and discuss it with the COTR on a daily basis.

Program Management and Control Requirements  
The Contractor is expected to deliver the experimental data in a timely fashion consistent with the specific tasks defined under Contractor Requirements.  The Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) will keep abreast of the progress of the work to determine if the contract requirements are being fulfilled.
. 
Inspection and Acceptance Requirements
Inspection of the project will take place in the office of the COTR in Building 50, Room 2148, and evaluated for acceptance whether the work is acceptable.

Government Requirements
The government will provide on-site laboratory space; furnish all necessary laboratory chemicals, cell lines, and all instruments necessary to allow the contractor to carry out the research.

Period of performance:  The proposed period of performance is August 5, 2010 thru February 4, 2011.  

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 50 South Drive, Building 50 Room 2148, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Biochemistry (LB) requires the services of Dr. Ick Young Kim, a former associate of the Laboratory of Biochemistry where he collaborated with Dr. Thressa C. Stadtman and also with Dr. Moon Bin Yim in Dr. Chocks Section.  In the Laboratory of Biochemistry, Dr. Kim employed molecular biological techniques and biochemical methods to study the regulation and characterization of selenophosphate synthetase.  In addition, Dr. Kim is an expert in enzyme activity assays, including those of protein tyrosine kinase.  He is prepared to come to Dr. Chocks laboratory to participate in studying the mechanism by which PMT-induced mTOR activity mediates PP2A tyrosine phosphorylation as well as elucidating the molecular mechanism by which PMT regulates Glut 1 gene expression in serum-starved cells and the role of Glut 1 in PMT-induced anchorage-independent proliferation.  Dr. Kim has the qualifications, experience, and expertise to carry out the proposed studies in the Laboratory of Biochemistry. His services will ensure continuity of the project in the Section on Metabolic Regulation, LB, by imparting his extensive skills to others in the laboratory who will continue with complementary lines of research.

<DESC><br />The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with University of Michigan to improve, maintain, and assess the PARCS (Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator) code package and support its application to the steady-state and transient analysis of current and future light water reactor (LWR) designs. These improvements will sustain code robustness, code health, and code applicability, giving the licensing program offices a more mature analysis product with which to inform regulatory decisions.
<p>University of Michigan is uniquely qualified to provide the services based on its knowledge and experience of the theory and algorithms utilized in PARCS. The NRC office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) has been developing the PARCS code since 1998 under a licensing agreement from the Purdue Research Foundation. Another license agreement with the University of Michigan has been developed due to the relocation of the PARCS development team. No comparable commercial and research code will couple to the NRC TRACE code without substantial duplication of costs to the Government in order to bring this selected tool up to the levels of maturity, modeling capabilities, and coding standards that PARCS has presently attained. The period of performance will be thirty six (36) months. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Kala Shankar, Sr. Contract Specialist by phone at (301) 492 3638 or via e-mail at kala.shankar@nrc.gov. See Numbered Note 22.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Columbus, Ohio, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,837 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4,206 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet. The lease shall be for a term of ten (10) years, five (5) years firm term.  The space must be available for occupancy by February 1, 2011.  

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Office space must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor and have the potential for an efficient layout.  The space cannot be located on the ground floor or top floor of any building.  Space shall be located in a professional office setting.  Subleases will not be considered.  Perimeter walls for the proposed space must be slab-to-slab or 13-gauge wire mesh from the dropped ceiling to slab.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including a total of 5 structured reserved parking spaces for Government use.  All services (including daytime janitorial service), janitorial supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the fully serviced rent.  Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as first class and comply with all current Federal, General Services Administration, state, and local codes including but not limited to regulations for fire and life safety, Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and seismic protection.  Space shall not be located within a base (100-year) flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative. The Government shall have access to the space 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

LOCATION:
Offered properties must be located within the Central Business District of Columbus, Ohio.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. 

This advertisement is not a basis for negotiation.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all expressions of interest and give consideration to properties other than those offered in response to this advertisement.  

OWNERS & AGENTS: This is an expression of interest for available space, NOT an invitation to bid.  Interested parties should write to the Governments designated representative, NOT LATER THAN AUGUST 6th, 2010 at the following address:

	Efrem Colmenero
	Studley, Inc. 
	15303 Dallas Parkway
	Suite 1200
	Addison, TX  75001
	Office: 972-692-1399
	ecolmenero@studley.com

The following should be included in the expression of interest letter:  
1) Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
2)  Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
3) ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.
4) Date of space availability.
5) Method of rentable space measurement.
6) Building ownership information.
7) Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
8) Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.
9) List of building services provided.

Responses submitted by agents must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the agents authority to submit an expression of interest on behalf of the building ownership.

The Governments decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information in response to this advertisement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items and/or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This action is being solicited on a Sole Source basis under authority 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The intended source is the Quantum, P.O. Box 57100, Irvine CA  92619-7100, as they are the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The proposed sole source action is for the repair, recertification, and maintenance of the Quantum Scalar I-2000 Tape Libraries located in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Field Offices in Hines, Illinois and Silver Springs, Maryland.  The Government is aware that there are Quantum authorized Value-Added Resellers (VAR) and Distributors who can provide Quantum technicians certified for repair and maintenance of tape libraries on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). However, in the recent past, repairs were performed on the tape libraries by technicians of a subcontractor of a SEWP IV contract holder who were not Quantum certified technicians. This resulted in critical damage to the system.  Resellers under SEWP cannot perform the recertification process. Only the OEM can perform both the repair and re-certification. Thus, the requirement for repair and recertification of the systems must be performed by Quantum.  Due to the urgent need for the repair of the tape library at Silver Springs, and the recertification of the tape libraries at Hines and Silver Springs, Quantum is the only source that can perform the effort.

This synopsis if provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered as a Request for Quotation; however, all responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency. The solicitation number is VA118-10-RQ-0648 and the response is due to be in receipt by this office not later than 07/28/10 at 2:00 PM EST.  

The proposed action is on a firm fixed price basis for the procurement of the repair, recertification, and maintenance of the Quantum I-2000 Tape Libraries which includes Quantum Gold Support Plan for Hines, IL and Quantum Silver Support Plan for Silver Springs, MD.  The period of performance will be from date of award through 12 months with two 12-month option periods to be exercised at the Government's discretion.

The Place of Delivery is:

<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>Domestically, the work is principally sedentary. While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required. Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>II. Minimum Qualifications</p>
<p>&bull; U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.<br />&bull; Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs. One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. <br />&bull; Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.<br />&bull; Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.<br />&bull; Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.<br />&bull; Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. <br />&bull; Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications. Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.</p>
<p>III. POSITION ELEMENTS</p>
<p>Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs. The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.</p>
<p>Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL. The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.</p>
<p>IV. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>

<DESC>The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) is seeking comments on a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the design of auction mechanisms to support several programs from the National Broadband Plan. The broadband plan may be found at: www.broadband.gov. The draft SOO comment period will be open through August 31, 2010.<br />The draft SOO seeks offerors with the capability to design and implement auction mechanisms for proposed incentive auctions and universal service fund support to provide comments to the FCC. Key elements of the proposed requirements included&nbsp;are developing a mechanism and associated proof of concept for each of the following programs:<br />(1)Voluntary clearing of broadcast TV spectrum: a mechanism to clear and reassign spectrum. In the case of broadcast television, this involves inducing TV broadcasters to give up spectrum voluntarily, repacking the spectrum to create a contiguous block of cleared spectrum well-suited for mobile broadband and assigning the cleared spectrum to new licensees; <br />(2) ongoing support of universal service: awarding universal service high cost support to a single service provider in a defined geographic area; <br />(3) one-time support of broadband buildout (fast track Connect America Fund): awarding one-time universal service high cost support to deploy broadband in currently unserved areas; and, <br />(4) one-time support of wireless broadband buildout (mobility fund): awarding one-time universal service high cost support to upgrade areas to a minimum level of 3G wireless coverage. <br />The draft SOO is attached to this notice.<br />Responses to questions and other information about the draft SOO will be reviewed and may be incorporated into the final SOO.<br />For prospective offerors, FCC will post a presolicitation notice and hold a presolicitation conference in Washington DC once the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued. The specific presolicitation conference date and location will be in RFP once posted. <br />Please send comments on the draft SOO via email to Bridget.gauer@FCC.gov by the requested response date.&nbsp; Please include the solicitation number in the subject of the email.<br />

<CONTACT>Andrew Chappell, (703) 325-1715

<a href="mailto:andrew.chappell1@us.army.mil">ITEC4, NCR PARC (NCR-CC)</a>
<DESC>Comments are solicited from potential Offerors for the proposed contracting approach to be used in the re-competition of the Movement Tracking System (MTS) III acquisition.  The purpose of this proposed method is to assure industry that the Government intends to conduct a fair, full and open competition to the maximum extent possible by allowing as many as possible responsible and responsive Offerors to compete.<BR><BR>     The National Capital Region Contracting Center (NCRCC) proposes to use a modified down-select approach to award a contract for the MTS requirement.  It will consist of two phases that will use a multiple award contract vehicle for execution of the necessary actions, and ultimately result in the award of a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR><BR><BR>Phase I (Initial Award)<BR><BR>     A formal source selection process, in accordance with FAR Part 15, will be used to select potential Offerors for multiple award IDIQ contracts.  The contract will contain a base period with four, one year option periods.  The base period will consist of a single CLIN while the option year CLINs will contain work and production quantities to be ordered for the duration of the contract.  The award of the basic contract will revolve around the selection of Offerors who best demonstrate the potential for their existing commercial system (one that is currently being used for commercial purposes, e.g. land, sea or air applications) or other suitable working system to be militarized* into a fully capable Movement Tracking System.  The existing commercial or suitable working system will utilize or have the same or similar basic elements and characteristics of the MTS system such as, but not limited to, the ability to send and receive messages by satellite, active RFID capabilities, geo-location and other status reporting capabilities, demonstrate mapping, route planning and overlay capabilities.  A live demonstration of a working system meeting the basic criteria (which may not be fully specified here) will be required for any further consideration.<BR><BR><BR>Phase II (Modified Down-Selection)<BR><BR>     A task order will be issued to all the multiple award holders at the start of the base period for the length of the base period (as yet undetermined, but comments invited) for a fixed amount (as yet undetermined, but comments invited) to satisfy the minimum guarantee.  The task will be for the award holder to militarize his existing system.  Limited Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) will be provided to aid in the militarization of the award holders existing system.  The deliverables will consist of a proposal and a prototype of the militarized system.  An evaluation of the deliverables against established criteria, the MTS specification and a test plan, will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 16.5.  The award holder whose proposal and prototype offers the best value to the Government will be awarded its first option year (exercise of option by modification), containing production quantities and other services for continuation of its contract.  The other multiple award contract holders will not be issued a modification to exercise a first option year resulting in a down-select to a single award IDIQ contract.<BR><BR><BR>* Militarized, as used here, means the incorporation of any commercially available material, equipment and services, as well as any GFE, to enable the Offerors working system to comply with the full MTS specifications and capabilities.<BR><BR> <BR>Specific comments are invited regarding:<BR><BR>     1) This type of contracting approach<BR>	<BR>     2) Given typical GFE consisting of universally compatible equipment (e.g. computer tablet, NGA mapping kit, GB-GRAM card), an estimated cost to militarize the Offerors existing working system and estimated length of time to do it<BR><BR><BR>No further details are available at this time and comments/questions about this approach are invited until 13 August 2010.  There will be no responses to comments or questions.<BR><BR>     You may direct comments to:<BR><BR>          zun.z.lin@us.army.mil<BR><BR>          andrew.chappell1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>          cc:  ed.charette@us.army.mil (Contracting Officer)

Each probe tests for a particular sequence of DNA and small groups of probes can be used to check for specific bacteria or viruses up to the species level. The LLMDA can test for over 2,000 viruses and 900 bacteria. The newer version of the LLMDA will expand that capability to nearly 6,000 viruses and 15,000 bacteria as well as fungi and protozoa organisms. After DNA and/or RNA is extracted from a sample, it is applied to the LLMDA. Any probe that detects its specific sequence will fluoresce, and be read by a scanner. The raw data from the scanner is then analyzed using algorithms developed by LLNL run on high performance computing (HPC) machines.</span></p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on a sole source basis from the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project Authority (SSCWRP). The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br /><br />Proposed vendor will provide data integration services related to estuarine and associated habitat datasets. SCCWRP was identified by the program office as the only source that can meet the technical requirement of this service procurement because SCCWRP is a regional joint-powers agency whose mission is to coordinate and facilitate aquatic resource assessment in southern California. Furthermore, SCCWRP serves as a technical lead on development and implementation of California's aquatic resource monitoring programs as directed under California Senate Bill 1070 and is a designated regional data center entrusted to manage mapping and monitoring data and facilitate data sharing among agencies and the public. As such, SCCWRP is uniquely positioned to help expand existing aquatic resource monitoring programs to accommodate eelgrass and other estuarine related datasets. No other known vendor can provide and integrate these services into existing aquatic resource monitoring programs. The government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract with a period of performance of August 15, 2010 to September 30, 2012.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation, such as the specifications of your product, in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after the publication of this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009, PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE EXISTING CONTRACTOR PROVIDING ARRA RELATED PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUPPORT VIA GSA BPA EA1330-09-BR-0021.</p>
<p>A Time and Materials task order against the above BPA with CACI-WGI will be issued for NOAA's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Project Management support in the management of projects being funded with ARRA resources. The Contractor will provide support for project formulation and management, including requirements and options analysis, cost estimating, schedule management, risk management, and performance and metric development. A time and materials task order is most appropriate as it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact extent or duration of the Project Management support needed or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence as it is not known what exact process will be employed from the outset and the full scope of ARRA resources that will require project management support. The above described task order will be issued on or about August 10, 2010.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service contemplates issuing a sole source award to PaperThin, Inc. for consulting and support services for their Commonspot Content Management System. To enable a closer relationship, PaperThin and NPS will enter into a more engaged Support Services relationship.
The goals for this engagement are to: Ensure that PaperThin's extensive experience and best practices are made available to NPS/DOI. Provide strategic technical consultation on architectural issues related to the inner workings/architecture of CommonSpot. Ensure that NPS/DOI utilize CommonSpot's framework to its fullest capabilities and deploy websites and applications rapidly and efficiently in a supported manner. Create acommunication pipeline that allows issues/questions to be identified and resolved faster and ultimately to create a process of growth that steers the NPS/DOI CommonSpot implementation away from future issues.
The NPS currently uses PaperThin's CommonSpot software and recently began expanding use of the software for full integration of all hosted websites within the NPS framework (both public and private). NPS requires PaperThin's unique knowledge to ensure that the NPS configuration and system architecture meet with the best practices of the product and all development work is completed in an optimal way that will meet scalability and system requirements.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) located in Orlando, FL under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) - Only One Reasonable Source and No Other Supplies or Service will satisfy agency requirements - plans to issue a sole source modification to Cubic Worldwide Technical Services to extend services for the period of performance beginning 1 October 2010 up until no later than 30 September 2011. This increase is necessary in order to continue support while a follow-on task order is awarded under the Fielded Training Systems Support III (FTSS III) Multiple Award Contract.
<p>The task order is for Firm Fixed Priced Contract Operation and Maintenance and Instruction Services (COMS and CIS) for CNATT, Commander Naval Air Forces Pacific Fleet (CNAF West) and Commander Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (CNAF East) at Marine Corps aviation training sites located throughout the United States, including MCAS Miramar, CA, MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA, MCAS Yuma, AZ, MCBH Kaneohe Bay, HI, MCAS New River, NC, MCAS Cherry Point, NC, and MCAS Beaufort, SC.</p>
<p>This action will result in a firm fixed priced contract with optional periods to extend services through 30 September 2011, if a full 12-month extension is necessary. This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract modification is not a request for competitive proposals. There is no solicitation document. Any firms believing that they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than&nbsp;9 August 2010. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality and reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firm's response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the period of performance that this synopsis represents. The point of contact for this action is Marcia Coleman 407-380-4966.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is set-aside 100% for Small Business.  Firm, fixed-price offers are requested under Request for Quotations (RFQ) solicitation number L10PS02918.  This document incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41.  The NAICS code is 611430.  The business size standard is $7 million.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement to maintain 608 communication sites, which demands a skilled workforce in both the radio and engineering career fields.  In some cases, the BLM employees construct new communication sites and/or oversee the work of contractors.  The Department of Interior developed a site inspection process that includes the use of a checklist to evaluate communication sites.  The checklist is titled "The United States Department of the Interior - National Radio and Spectrum Program Management Office FORM NRSPMO-SS-001 Radio Electronic Site Survey Instrument", and may be found at the attachment to this SOW.
The BLM requires  a tailored course which covers the concepts behind the information contained in the checklist with an emphasis on grounding, as well as a visit to a BLM radio site(s) to reinforce the classroom concepts (hands-on training) and to learn how to evaluate a communications site (reference attachment). 
A full copy of the combined syponsis/solicitation is available at FedConnect  (https://www.fedconnect.net)

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements.  

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing the same or similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same (or most similar) equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

 Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes
the only solicitation; quotes are being requested , and a written solicitation will
not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  
(RFQ) NIH-OD-263-2010-721.  The solicitation documents and incorporated
provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition circular
FAC2005-41 dated May 13, 2010.  This acquisition will be processed under 
Simplified Acquisitions Procedures (SAP) and is set aside for small businesses.

The Statement of Work is attached.  The period of performance is for one year from
date of award.  

Evaluation Criteria

Proposals received shall first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to
proposed cost.  Those proposals considered technically acceptable shall then be 
evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.  Although technical factors are  of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall decision.  All evaluation factors, other than cost/price, when considered
are significantly more important that cost or price.  

Offerors are advised that an award will be made to that offeror whose proposal
provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government.  The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance
capability superiority rather than the lowest overall cost.  However the Government 
will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve
only slightly superior performance.  Overall cost to the Government may become the
ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal
based on other factors.  This evaluation shall be based upon the completeness and thoroughness of the proposal submitted.  The offeror should show the objectives
stated in the request for proposal are understood and offer a logical consistent program
for their achievement. 

Evaluation Factors are:

Past Performance 40%    
Familiarity with the Government 30%
Price 20%
Corporate Experience 10%

The following FAR clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR Part 52.212-1 
Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52-212-2 Evaluations Commercial

<p>A. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability. The offeror's demonstrated technical capability to meet the Government's requirement</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: The offeror's demonstrated record, as confirmed by references, of successful past performance of the same or substantially similar contract efforts including quality of services or supplies, timeliness of performance and delivery, cost control and the offeror's business relations.</p>
<p>Sources (i.e. Government databases or other individuals) other than those identified in the offeror's proposal may be contacted/accessed by the Government. The Government may use the additional information received in its evaluation of the offeror's past performance and responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price. Although the proposed cost or price is not listed as an evaluation factor, it shall be considered a significant criterion in the overall evaluation of proposals. The factors listed above are in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>C. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>D. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting ["can not be determined at this time"] .<br />(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.<br />(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.<br />(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or dive stures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.<br />HSAR 3052.209-73<br />LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (JUN 2006)<br />(a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

ALL QUOTED ITEMS MUST BE BRAND NAME SPECIFIED.  PARTIAL QUOTES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  COMPARABLE ITEMS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED 
This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. This is a 100% small-business set-aside. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 212399 with a size standard of 500 emp.
The contract resulting from this combined synopsis, solicitation, will be a firm-fixed price contract. 
DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS: Prices shall be FOB destination, delivery to Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) ATTN: Facilities Maintenance  HC 83, Box 1 BLDG 7047 Bridgeport, CA 93517-5009. Required delivery date : 5 Aug 2010.
PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Preservation and Packaging shall be best commercial practice, sufficient to protect and preserve all items supplied under this contract during shipping to destination.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>Amendment to respond to questions provided in regards to this solicitation. The answers to the questions stated below will be used to assist potential bidders to better understand the Government's requirement. A new due date will be issued, ending on July 27th, 2010.<br /><br />1) The announcement says "8 virus suspensions (each lot=400 vials) in Vero or SPF eggs." However, the SOW states 500-2500 vials will be requested.<br /><br />&nbsp;Answer - The delivery of a minimum of 400-500 vials will be enough to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meet the&nbsp;Government's requirement.<br /><br />2) In section III, Deliverables and Reporting Requirements, virus suspensions and cell lines are included, but the SOW does not specify including qualified cell line production. Please clarify.<br /><br />&nbsp;Answer - No new qualified cell line will need to be produced. NIH has a&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualified&nbsp;Vero cell line that will be provided to the company to use<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this virus&nbsp;production. <br /><br />3) Is there a proposed start date and duration to complete all eight (8) virus suspensions?<br /><br />&nbsp;Answer - The start date for production will be as soon as possible, likely after<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp;pre-IND meeting. NIH would like to shoot for September or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October. The&nbsp;time line should be approximately 6 months to <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce&nbsp;1 virus after we&nbsp;supply each seed stock. So if NIH were to <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a few viruses a year,&nbsp;this&nbsp;would occur over a 2-5 year period.

<DESC>Questions and Answers&nbsp; (All questions must be submitted in writing to bonnie.oshiro@noaa.gov)<br /><br />Q1: In the Statement of Work, under "Work Requirements" number 4 it states that each dataset (singular) should take no longer than 20 hours. Does this mean that there are 130 datasets and that each one takes 20 hours? or that the 130 datasets will take a total of 20 hours to complete? The 130 number is coming from the "quantity" section on the "Request for Quotation" form.
<p>A1: Item 4 of the SOW reads, "...The government estimates that the analysis of a dataset and preparation of a final report should take no longer than 20 hours..." Item 7 of the SOW reads, "...For each dataset analyzed, the contractor shall prepare a final report..." The dataset referred to is the nominal dataset consisting of ~200 digital images associated with a 50-minute towed-diver survey. Contractors are asked to provide pricing to analyze 130 datasets. The government estimates that it should take no longer than 130 x 20 = 2600 hours of time-on-task to complete the analysis of 130 datasets and provide 130 reports documenting each dataset.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<RESPDATE>080210
<CONTACT>Isaac Bellamy, Phone 3014430150, Email isaac.bellamy@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:
The prevention and reduction of healthcare-associated infections is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The HHS Steering Committee for the Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) was established in July 2008 and developed the HHS Action Plan for the Prevention of Health-Associated Infections, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce healthcare-associated infections.  The Action Plan established national goals for healthcare-associated infection prevention and outlined key actions for achieving identified short and long-term objectives.  The Action Plan was intended to enhance collaboration with external stakeholders and to strengthen coordination and impact of national efforts. Recognizing that efforts to make progress hinge on the ability of states to lead and coordinate prevention efforts at the regional and state level. The 2009 Omnibus bill required states receiving Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant funds to certify that they would submit a plan to reduce Health-Associated Infections to the Secretary of Health and Human Services not later than January 1, 2010. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a State HAI plan template to facilitate coordination with national HAI prevention efforts.  All 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico submitted plans that reflect current and proposed prevention activities, identify needs, and set realistic priorities and five-year targets.  By having each state identify its own goals based on the level of infrastructure and resources presently in place, HHS has been able to gather valuable information that is currently guiding our prevention efforts.

PURPOSE:
In May 2010, OPHS regional offices were encouraged to submit 2010 regional HAI Prevention Project proposals using information and data from the national and regional state HAI plans, the CDC review, and the expertise of HAI state advisory councils.  After a comprehensive review of materials, the RHA staff identified activities that could be implemented to address the HAI state/regional gaps, i.e., formative research with consumers on public reporting of infections rates, and education to healthcare personnel. 

HHS Region VI received funding to develop a regional HAI work group that includes infectious disease experts from each state, and other federal agencies/offices who will work together to develop website elements to be included in a health care-associated infection consumer friendly website.  The process work will involve designing focus group questions and survey information to obtain consumer input regarding health care-associated infections and potential use of this information to make informed health care decisions. 

STATEMENT OF WORK:
During FY 2010, a contractor will be selected to work with the regional/state HAI team to provide consultation and assistance 1) to research and evaluate existing national/state HAI websites that involve consumer information 2) to design consumer focus group questions 3) to identify state locations for two/three consumer focus groups  4) to identify and recruit focus group participants that is representative of the regional population,  5) to analyze focus group data  5) to plan monthly HAI regional taskforce conference calls, and one face-face meeting to finalize elements for the consumer website, and 6) to prepare a final report.

TASKS:
The contractor will: 
1.Arrange HAI regional workgroup monthly conference calls, meeting agenda, and meeting notes.
2.Plan with HAI workgroup the goal(s), objectives, time line, evaluation for prioritizing the elements to be included in the consumer friendly website. 
3.Arrange for HAI regional workgroup logistics for one face to face meeting to discuss the final elements to be included in the consumer friendly website.
4.Conduct extensive preliminary research of existing HAI websites to ensure state specific websites will be useful and accessible.
5.Design focus group questions and survey information to obtain consumer input regarding  health care associated infections and potential use of this information to make informed health care decisions. 
6.Identify two or three state focus group locations for conducting focus groups.
7.Identify and recruit focus group participants that represent the regional population.
8.Analyze focus group data, and present written information to HAI workgroup in the face to face meeting.
9.Prepare a final report of all activities accomplished in Year 1.

DELIVERABLE(S):
1.After each monthly HAI workgroup conference call, contractor will provide written conference call notes, and also arrange a conference call with RHA office planning group to discuss project current findings and timeline progress. 
2.At end of first quarter, provide HAI workgroup with extensive preliminary research environmental scan written report.

<DESC>This amendment for the mobile kitchen and mobile canteen units is to provide the questions and answers the Government received in response to RFQ #N10PS8383.
Questions and Answers for RFQ #N10PS18383 - Mobile Kitchen and Mobile Canteen Units
Amendment 1 to RFQ N10PS18383
To the extent that the answers and clarifications  below  and the adding of details with respect to the post-award repair and maintenance represent a change in the statement of work, all prospective offerors are to consider this question and answer document as amendment 1 to the solicitation.   Offerors are, in their quotes, to explicitly acknowledge receipt, acceptance and understanding of Amendment 1.  
Q1 - Once the winner is awarded the job is there a time period or date for which the unit needs to be completed and delivered by?
A1 -  The preference for completion and delivery would be approximately 120 days (3 months) from date of the award. 
Q2 -  (This question is paraphrased here because it contained information potentially proprietary that could have reduced this offeror's competitiveness.) The products will be built at a location more than 300 miles from DC. Would this automatically disqualify us
A2 - (BACKGROUND:  The site visit and acceptance appointment for this Contractor would be at a place beyond 300 miles from Washington D. C. even though the contractor's principal place of business is within 300 miles of D. C.)     
The government will accept and consider the proposal, but in evaluating the proposal, it would consider the cost that the government would incur in travelling to the distant location.  The government is not in a position to be able to accept a reimbursement of a government travel expense from a contractor, so the price of the goods would have to be sufficiently competitive to the point where the cost of goods plus added cost of travel would total less than competing offers, all other technical aspects being equal.   The 300 mile limit was intended to apply primarily to the place where the company would honor its warranty in the post award phase and to insure that the place around Washington, D. C., to which the government would have to bring vehicles for repair and maintenance could  be easily accessible and cost effective.
Q3 - (Rear full door, Mobile Canteen Unit) Are you wanting doors that are the full width of the truck or a single "man door" that is approx. 36" wide?
A3 - The preference is a doorway that is larger than 36" wide, the approximate width of the rear of the trailer. 


Q4 - (2-door blower refrigerator, Mobile Canteen Unit)  Can you clarify?
A4 - A floor to ceiling refrigerator unit approximately 66" wide, with side by side doors (2 door) 
Q5 - (Stainless steel counter buffer area, Mobile Kitchen Unit)  Can you clarify?  Is this a space between the burners and other items?
A5 - Countertop space between cooking areas and other items where appropriate
Q6 - (30" wide opening with swing door & sight window, Mobile Kitchen Unit)  I assume this is a door.  If so, it needs to be 36" wide to get equipment in the trailer.
A6 - 30" was the correct dimension 
Q7 - What is a "blower" refrigerator? What is the difference between it and a standard refrigeration unit?
A7 - Most commercial refrigerators are 'blower'units to assist with evaporation and air circulation. This is the unit called for in the RFQ
Q8 - What will they be using the "cold plate" refrigeration for? Do they want a cold plate in an effort to save power, prevent food loss, or what reason would they like the cold plate as opposed to a standard refrigeration unit?
A8 - Once cold plates are charged they will maintain temperature for when the unit is in transit, therefore it best serves the needs for this unit. Cold plate is also best for our needs in case of a generator failure. Cold plate refers mainly to the freezer unit. 
Q9 - Is - (4) 150,000 BTU Roof mount AC units a typo error?  That is way too much.  
A9 - 15,000 BTU 
Q10 - What is the Contract award date?
A10 - Probably within 60 days of closing date by which the quotes are to be submitted.  Legal reviews, request for clarifications from "short-listed" offerors, etc., may delay award.
Q11 - What are your expectations for a completion date and delivery?
A11 - Required delivery date is to be within 120 days of award of contract 
Q12 - What are your sign off and testing processes? 
A12 - The technical evaluation will involve reviewing the units for all requested items referenced in the RFQ. 
Q13 - We suggest that we train your personnel, what are your expectations for training? If so, will this be done at our location or do we need to calculate in travel and time for our staff to train at your location?
A13 - Training isn't in the solicitation - this element can be proposed separately as an unsolicited proposal.  See FAR subpart 15.605 for contents of such proposals.  Can be awarded on sole source basis if company receives basic award for the vehicles themselves, but training proposed in the response to the solicitation can't be evaluated.  Webpage link: https://www.acquisition.gov/.../Subpart%2015_6.html - Cached.  
Q14 - Are we going to deliver this unit or will you come pick it up?
A14 - To be picked up as detailed in the RFQ.
Q15 - Please explain " Flat Aluminum overhead security door with 120V florescent lighting"
A15 - The overhead security door will fold down and lock over the windows in the unit, providing a secure unit. During operation, the door rises up, allowing for an awning over the windows. 
Q16 - Please explain " Plexiglass doors located wherever possible" Are you referring to cabinet doors?
A16 - Overhead storage cabinets with sliding plexiglass doors (canteen unit) 
Q17 - No AC for the Canteen unit?  We suggest at least a 2500 BTU unit.
A17 - The AC for the Canteen unit is placed within the cab (driving portion of the unit). 
Q18 - Canteen calls for 25 gal water heater, the kitchen trailer calls for a 4 gallons, is that correct?
A18 - 2.5 gallon water heater for canteen, 4 gallons for kitchen trailer, both fast recovery units 
Q19 - Are you satisfied that the generators will be big enough?  Once we calculate the complete power requirements for the equipment, lighting, outlets, etc. we might need a bigger generator?  Have you already calculated this?
A19 - The generators listed are sufficient 
Q20 - The equipment requested for the canteen is a challenge.have you already done a preliminary layout of the interiors, to insure all the equipment requested will fit?
A20 - It is understood that the project is a challenge - we expect the company engineers to configure by using equipment with dimensions that will fit.                          
Q21 - Is the kitchen equipment electric or propane?  In our experience, it would be best if it was all one or the other.
A21 - Cooking equipment is propane. 
Q22 - Height may be an issue with Freezers on the gooseneck area, are we free to move them around in the layout to another location?
A22 - The requirement does not specify the location of the equipment
Q23 - Kitchen trailer calls for the generator to be mounted in the rear of the trailer. Weight may be an issue, with mounting this behind the wheels of the trailer. Can we move this to the gooseneck?
A23 - The requirement does not specify the location of the equipment

Justification and Approval 


1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  

VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Contracting Office, Biloxi, MS, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition for Social Work Services.


2.	Nature/Description of Action

A new firm-fixed priced requirements contract for Homeless Transitional Services which is currently being provided under Fee Agreement with Harbor House is being contemplated as authorized under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 17.48.  


3.	Description of Supplies/Services

The requirement is to provide emergency housing to Veterans along with other services to assist them in transitioning back into the community.  Ten (10) beds are intended to be utilized for these services. The transitional housing is for a period of 6 months or 180 days. Historically, Harbor House has reported that the ten beds have not been fully utilized and that the most they have assisted is four to six.


4.	Identification of Statutory Authority

( X )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                          
                                           Research Capability or Expert Services
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest


5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:

a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:

In accordance with the above listed authority and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Harbor House is the only known operational Homeless Transitional Services facility in Pensacola, FL where the services are required.


b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:

      A Sources Sought Notice was issued 1 March 2010.  One SDVOSB showed interest but his establishment is in Port Charlotte, FL and he would not set up new operations in Pensacola unless given a contract first.  Because the VA would need to inspect a contractor's actual proposed facility as part of the solicitation's evaluation factors, this would be impossible to accomplish as the potential Offeror does not currently have established operations in Pensacola. Further market research through Internet sources revealed that there are no other established Homeless Transitional Service providers in Pensacola.

c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.

A Sources Sought Notice issued 1 March 2010 revealed only two interested companies.  One is the "Incumbent" who currently provides services under a Fee Agreement and the other is a SDVOSB who currently does not have operations in the Pensacola, Florida area.  Executive Order 13360, therefore, is not required as the SDVOSB is not currently available.  
  
d. If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.

N/A

      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:

N/A


6.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost

The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable because a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract. 

7.	Description of market survey and any interested sources. If no market survey was conducted, state the reason.

A Sources Sought Notice issued 1 March 2010 revealed only two interested companies.  One is the "Incumbent" who currently provides services under a Fee Agreement and the other is a SDVOSB who currently does not have operations in the Pensacola, Florida area.  The Executive Order 13360 therefore is not required as the SDVOSB is not currently available.  
8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:

a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:

N/A

b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:

Current amount paid per Veteran is $40 per day to Harbor House under a Fee Agreement.  It is believed that Harbor House will seek a higher amount due to our failure to fill all ten beds and also due to changes in the economy.  Prices of similar nature will be obtained from other VA's to determine a fair and reasonable price before award is made.


c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:

N/A


9.	Sources expressing an interest:

Harbor House, Pensacola, FL (Current provider under Fee Agreement)

Halcyon Management Group,Lighthouse Addiction Services, Port Charlotte, FL (SDVOSB)


10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:

We will continue to maintain contact with Halcyon Management Group to see if they establish operations in Pensacola, FL.  We will also continue to monitor the market through FedBizOpps and through the Social Work Services who work in the Pensacola area to determine when new companies enter the marketplace.

11. Delivery Requirements:

Base Period: June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011
1st Option Period: June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012
2nd Option Period: June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013
3rd Option Period: June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014
4th Option Period: June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015

12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is ( X ) is not required for this acquisition.

13. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, include appropriate approvals.

The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation an any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans.

Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about September 01, 2010.  Contracts will have a base period, with options for two additional one-year terms exercisable at the discretion of the VA.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on DCA200-96-H-0041-TF3R<br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  VA Puget Sound Medical Center

2.	Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a freezer and refrigerator emergency service/repair contract from Spectrum Services for a period of 21 July 2010 through 30 Sep 2010.

Spectrum Service
2720 Rucker Ave Ste 101
Everett, WA 98201
1-253-850-7754

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: 
i.	Emergency response calls to core-use freezer and refrigerator failures to be established through a blanket purchase order. All repair calls will be billed against this purchase order.
ii.    This will include all lab refrigerators, lab freezers, walk-in refrigerators/freezers, and refrigerator/freezer dependent equipment.
iii. Same day emergency response,  24 hours/day, 7 days/wk.
iv. Charges: labor $104.00/hr., one time per job truck fee $39.00, overtime rates apply outside of regular work hours.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(  ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will          
                    Satisfy Agency Requirements;

	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: This purchase order will support the research program at the VA Puget Sound Medical Center by protecting irreplaceable research materials that are generally stored under ultra-low freezing conditions.  The loss of one freezer can result in the loss of millions of dollars worth of samples and biological constructs.  The mission of the VA is enhanced by protecting critical resources necessary for the advancement of scientific discoveries that directly and indirectly benefit veterans.
 
6.	 Actions to Promote Competition:  In the future, the contracting officer will conduct additional market research for vendors who are certified to diagnose and repair these refrigerators.  

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 15,000.  Previous Purchase Order (D06010) $20,000 was for similar service. The contracting specialist has determined the price to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Spectrum Service is a local small business. Market Research indicated that there were only two companies that can diagnose and repair negative 80 degrees or lower freezers.  Spectrum Services has four employees that are certified to do this work.  

9.	Other Considerations:  None

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting officer will research the market by submitting sought sources through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors can provide this service. 

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition of research expertise and services for University Institutional Review Board (IRB) No. 4 registered with the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) as IRB# 00006412(IRB4) whereby Jesse Brown VA Medical Centers Research & Development Service will utilize its Affiliate, University of Illinois at Chicago, IRB Services.  

3.	A description of supplies/services required:  UICs IRBs shall perform all of the functions required under 38 CFR 16 (Common Rule) for reviewing and approving human subject research conducted under the auspices of Jesse Brown VA Medical Center Federalwide Assurance (FWA00000290). This includes, but is not limited to, research supported by the VA or conducted at a VA facility, and research involving VA patients as research subjects (hereafter VA research). IRB review and approval of VA research shall be conducted in accordance with 38 CFR 16 and 17, 45 CFR 46 subparts A through D, 45 CFR 160, 164, 21 CFR 50 and 56, 312, 600 and 812 (where applicable), and other pertinent federal regulations and guidance; and VA rules and policies as set forth in writing in VA policy Manual 3 and Handbooks. 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1.  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The VAs minimum needs need not be provided through full and open competition when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).  

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  This contract is necessary for the continuation of the Research program at Jesse Brown VAMC, as federal regulations prohibit conducting human subject research without IRB approval.  It is unlawful to conduct human subjects research without the services of an IRB.  VA policy states that if a VAMC does not convene its own IRB, it must contract with the academic affiliate.  Use of commercial IRBs is prohibited.  

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  Services can only be obtained from Jesse Brown VA Medical Centers Academic Affiliate.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The Affiliate will provide a price breakdown and this data will be shared with VAs Research & Development Service.  As experts in the field, they will assist the Contracting Officer in determining price reasonableness.  Based upon prior year costs, the Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a Base plus two-year contract for $258,450.  Therefore, the Contracting Officer anticipates the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

8.	Market survey conducted:  None

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
