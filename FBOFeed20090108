<SUBJECT>10 -- NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR SOCET GXP SOFTWARE
<SOLNBR>R1985
<CONTACT>Kiel Anderson kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA), by the 950th Electronic Systems Group, Hanscom AFB, MA, which intends to issue a contract to BAE Systems National Security Solutions Incorporated, Reston, VA for the procurement of 124 copies of SOCET GXP software and 124 copies of SOCET Screener Upgrade Entitlement licenses, pursuant to the authority of FAR Parts 6.3, 12 and 13.501(a) Sole Source Acquisitions.
SOCET GXP, an Electronic Light Table (ELT) imaging software, allows users to input, roam, annotate, manipulate, and output images from photographs, film, satellite images, maps, charts, and other real world data. Images are loaded through the Visual Coverage Tool (VCT), which allows for visual management of online and offline data used with the BAE family of image exploitation software.
The Government intends to contract with BAE, as the only holder of the SOCET GXP software under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".
This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor shall it be construed as a commitment by the Government.
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days of this publication.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  
An Ombudsman, Col Russell Blaine, Director, Commander's Staff, (781) 377-5106, has been appointed to hear concerns. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the program manager and/or Contractor Officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Please direct any questions regarding this Notice to Patricia J. Forest, Contracting Officer, tel. (781) 266-1048, e-mail:  pat.forest@hanscom.af.mil

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to assess industry capability for Terminal Automation System Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Operational Support and Analysis effort for the FAA's Terminal Automation Group (ATO-T).  The effort is a continuation of work currently being performed by a small business.
At this time, the acquisition strategy has not been determined.  The results of this survey will be used to determine if the requirement should be set aside for competition between small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort has been identified as "541512 Computer Systems Design Services" with a size standard of $25M or less of gross annual receipts over the past year.  FAA will consider vendor suggestions for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of effort described herein.  
FAA will also consider prime subcontractor relationships as long as the Small Business criteria are adhered to.   
The requirement is for Independent Verification and Validation Operational Support and Analysis for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS)and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS).  Raytheon Company is the STARS prime contractor.  Lockheed Martin is the CARTS Prime Contractor.  These systems collect information from radar (multilateration and ADS-B currently being considered as added sensors), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in the Terminal Service Areas.  
These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IV&V to ensure that system software evolution continues to decrease the accident risk, the number of incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.
The FAA is requesting that potential vendors provide appropriate responses of no more than 25 pages to the following FAA areas of interest:  
1.	Generalized Knowledge 	C++, ANSI C, and Linnux capabilities.	Familiarity with Sun Workstation Platforms, Motorola Power PCs, and other PC models. 	Experience with fusion of multiple sensor inputs into a single display.   	Experience with Kalman and similar filters. 	Experience re-hosting software on test bed platforms.	Experience which directly relates to the effort set forth in this announcement with sufficient narrative description.    
2.	Knowledge of Trackers and Tracker Registration related to surveillance sensors and systems similar STARS and ARTS:   	Overall experience with surveillance sensors and trackers.  	Development and analysis capability related to tracker algorithms. 	Experience with reconciling position reports with position truth.	Experience with dynamic bias correction	Knowledge of registration function and thoughts on potential for automating the function.   	Experience or thoughts on the affect of high performance targets on the correlator and altitude tracker.    	Knowledge and experience with extrapolation errors and conversion to stereographic plane.  
3.	Analysis experience in the following areas: 	Cost and benefits analysis.	Processing power and load analysis.	Analysis of Fusion tradeoffs	Analysis of filtering schemes.  	Analysis of Integration of multiple sensors 
4.	Test Capability.	Vendor capability for independent analysis/development of test tools to validate tracking algorithms and system performance.   
5.	Statistical Analysis 	Experience in analysis of live data recordings (DRF Tapes) to construct a baseline performance measure. 
6.	Company Resources:	Subject matter expert(s) and length of experience in surveillance or air traffic control systems.    	Personnel experience and length of experience in analysis and assessment of design, development, and implementation of Air Traffic control safety functions software.    	Potential Program Director(s) knowledgeable in air traffic control system issues, tracking and safety. 
Vendors responding to this survey must meet the following criteria:
1.	Be a Certified Small Business in accordance with NAICS Code 541512, or a suggested code consistent with the areas of interest described above.2.

FEMA reserves the right to issue additional task orders for continued services within the scope of the contract. CLINs 500, 600 and 700 shall be performed on each unit in the field each month.  It is FEMA?s intent to negotiate CLINs 800, 1000 and 1600 on a task order basis when, if needed. CLIN 800:  It is assumed that ten percent (10%) of the units will require major repairs during the life of the contract.  CLIN 1000: It is assumed that there is a nominal need for miscellaneous repairs.  CLIN 900: It is assumed that twenty percent (20%) of the units will require an emergency repair during the life of the contract. CLIN 1200: It is assumed that ten percent (10%) of the total number of units installed will need to be temporarily deactivated during the life of the contract.  This normally is associated with demolition of an adjacent damaged structure.  Unit deactivation assumes all units will be deactivated during the life of the contract.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Nikon Instruments, Inc., of Melville, New York, for the acquisition of a fluorescence adaptation for a Nikon MM-400 microscope to be used in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for a fluorescence adaptation for a Nikon MM-400 microscope to be used in experiments to complement visible light wafer metrology.  By doping photoresist with radiation sensitive compounds that become fluorescent upon exposure, it becomes possible to generate latent image information in fluorescence mode.

Sole source determination is due to the necessity for compatibility with the existing Nikon MM-400 microscope.  In order to adapt the microscope for fluorescence mode, it will be necessary to alter several parts of the existing microscope, exchanging existing parts for new parts.  The parts that are required, and the parts to be exchanged, are proprietary to Nikon, and are designed specifically for the MM-400 instrument.

Nikon Instruments is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required fluorescence adaptation for NISTs Nikon MM-400 microscope.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to award a contract for a BPCA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) responsible for providing the requisite personnel, facilities and services to support aspects of data collection, analysis and reporting in support of regulatory reporting for the pediatric clinical trials, and select preclinical data conducted under the authority of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). BPCA was initially authorized by Congress in 2002 and recently reauthorized in September 2007, to improve labeling information for drugs used to treat children. The anticipated contract type will be cost reimbursement with a five to seven year period of performance.  Further details will be provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP) to be issued in approximately 2  4 weeks after the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.  This is a follow-on procurement to the initial DCC that was awarded in 2003, to Premier Research Incorporated, of Philadelphia, PA.  

BPCA Structure  

NICHD is establishing the newest phase of BPCA, by establishing a consortium of contractors to provide overall support for BPCA activities. This structure will require a high level of interaction among the various contractors and with NICHD.  This structure, henceforth termed the BPCA Consortium, will work together to construct, implement, and monitor the clinical and preclinical activities within the BPCA to improve the knowledge and labeling of drugs, biologics and devices used in children.  NICHD anticipates that communications and collaborations amongst all Consortium contractors will occur through regular scheduled teleconference, on-line activities, and face to face meetings.  This will be accomplished with the establishment of a Consortium Steering Committee, which will consist of the principal investigators (or senior staff representative) off all BPCA Contractors and the NICHD Project Officers of each contractor.  In the coming year, NICHD anticipates awards of the following contracts in support of BPCA:

	BPCA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to serve as the master contractor for the conduct of preclinical and clinical trial studies under BPCA.  
	BPCA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to manage and house all of the data generated from the Clinical Trials Network, including leadership, tracking and submission of all FDA regulatory documents generated under BPCA.
	BPCA Repository to track and store all of the biological specimens generated from BPCA clinical trial activities.
	BPCA Scientific Support (SS) to provide literature reviews, scientific analyses, market surveys and conduct workshops, symposia and conferences for the development of diverse pediatric therapeutic approaches to be utilized in the prioritization and selection of pediatric therapeutics for further study by BPCA.  

A major responsibility of the new BPCA-DCC will be to provide state of the art data capture and sharing in order to integrate the data from the clinical trials across dissimilar clinical specialties, and clinical sites.  This also includes the integration of data from preclinical studies as well.  The DCCs responsibility will be to insure integrity of the data collected and the regulatory compliance with the FDA and NICHD policies on the conduct of clinical and preclinical studies.  The activities conducted by the BPCA-DCC will support data collection, data tracking, and data analysis and data storage for the generation and submission of all necessary reports to the FDA.  It is expected that the Contractor will understand and be able to perform and coordinate all of the regulatory responsibilities for NIH for the submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and New Drug Applications (NDA), as applicable, under the reauthorized BPCA of 2007.   The regulatory requirements of BPCA 2007 also include assisting NICHD in tracking Proposed Pediatric Study Requests submitted to the FDA by NICHD Project Officers.

<DESC><p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to contract, on a sole source basis, with Dr. Philip O. Anderson, University of California, San Diego Medical Center. The purpose of this effort is to continue to build, update and maintain LactMed, a database, on possible adverse side effects of prescription and nonprescription drugs and diagnostic agents in infants that result from transmission during human breast-feeding.</p>
<p>This requirement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Non-Commercial). This acquisition is a small business, and veteran-owned business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541990.</p>
<p>NLM anticipates that the award will be made for one year from date of award and 4 (four) successive one-year option periods. The place of performance will be at the contractor facility. <br />The LactMed database, which was created, developed and maintained by Dr. Anderson for the past 4 years, has become widely acclaimed in the medical community and is the third most accessed TOXNET database. Specialized Information Services (SIS) is in the process of building, both internally and through outsourcing, a number of drug-related databases that are essential to NLM's maintenance of specialized medical and scientific information in the public domain.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following services are required... <br />1. Compile the world's professional and scientific literature relating to drug use during human lactation. Organize this literature into a professionally acceptable system for ease of access to articles on specific drugs and, where appropriate, classes of pharmacologic and/or therapeutic agents. Drug names should be at the generic level and include, at a minimum, United States Adopted Names.</p>
<p>2. At a minimum, database records should include the drug names specified above, drug class(es), pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data such as drug concentrations in breast milk and infant serum, time course of such levels, and weight-adjusted percent of maternal dose in breast milk, when it can be determined from case report evaluations and other analyses of published literature, provide possible drug effects on maternal lactation and in breast-fed infants, indicating a quantifiable probable causation. Information should also be provided with respect to those drugs that present no safety problems where published literature specifically makes that determination. All drug data within records must follow the approved drug record template, and note available source references.</p>
<p>The contractor shall implement these tasks with minimal direction, but in close collaboration with the government.&nbsp; Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, Dr. Anderson is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement. Dr. Anderson, an internationally recognized authority on drug use and lactation, brings a wealth of experience to this project. SIS and NLM require the services of Philip O. Anderson, Pharm.D., a Health Sciences Clinical Professor of Pharmacy at the University of California San Diego to complete the development and continue the maintenance of LactMed, an evidence based database, that is a needed enhancement in the pharmaceutical area to the Toxnet suite of pharmacological-toxicological databases maintained by SIS. This will allow continuation of the project within SIS's strategic planning for new pharmaceutical and pharmacology databases.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The vendor must possess the knowledge of the programs of NLM and LactMed, must have access to a comprehensive set of professional case evaluations from the source literature and can organize the data in a consistent and user friendly format. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement. This requirement is NLM Synopsis No. NLM-09-035-KDP. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by January 29, 2009. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. Questions must be submitted in writing to Kimberly D. Pringle at pringlek@mail.nlm.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>
<p>Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/. The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions-Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items).</p>

<DESC>ONR 312 Electronic Warfare (EW) seeks white papers for efforts that shall develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation components and systems in Electronic Warfare. Although white papers addressing any truly innovative EW S&T will be considered, the primary emphasis of this BAA is on technologies to Detect and Defeat Imaging Infrared and Multi-Mode Threats. Proposed efforts should focus on development of technology and techniques to detect and/or counter advanced threat
tracking systems, missiles, and other Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) that:
&#61485;
 - Employ imaging sensors (both scanning and Focal Plane Array (FPA)-based) operating in the infrared spectral bands (with emphasis on the atmospheric transmission bands at roughly 1-2, 3-5, and 8-12 micrometers) designed to passively track targets, guide weapons, and negate the effectiveness of infrared countermeasures that have limited spectral or spatial fidelity to the target signature, 

or

&#61485; - Employ multiple passive and/or active modes of tracking and guidance (electro-optical imaging, infrared seeking, laser spot/beam tracking, radar homing, active radar emitting, radio frequency command guidance, etc.) that can operate sequentially or simultaneously during weapon engagement to negate the effectiveness of single-mode countermeasures.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to purchase the following goods and services by Competitive Negotiation:

TVA intends to request in the near future proposals for a long-term (5 years, with option to extend) agreement to conduct modifications, outage and supplemental maintenance work at TVAs fossil, nuclear, and hydro generating plants, and possibly work at other TVA controlled facilities.  The selected CONTRACTORs principal work would be to employ and manage all craft labor necessary for the execution of modifications, outage and supplemental maintenance work, including construction, rehabilitation, modifications, removal, replacement, asbestos abatement (direct or through subcontractors), insulation and lagging (direct or through subcontractors), and construction testing of components and/or systems identified by TVA at generating plants and other sites located within the Tennessee Valley region.  In connection with this work, CONTRACTOR would perform a variety of functions, including but not limited to, site/field engineering, project management functions, quality control functions including inspection and testing services, training (craft and non craft), administration and enforcement of a safety program meeting OSHA and TVA standards, administration of CONTRACTORs subcontractors and TVAs contractors as assigned and possibly some procurement related activities (as authorized for materials and equipment approved by TVA).

TVA intends that any resulting contract would be cost reimbursable and that all fee/profit would be based on performance.

The selected CONTRACTOR(s) would be required to become signatory to the Project Labor Agreements that govern craft work at TVA sites.

Unless otherwise agreed to between TVA and the Contractor, the following exclusions and limitations will apply.

Exclusions:
	CONTRACTOR will not perform any design engineering services.
	CONTRACTOR will not directly perform services for Nuclear Steam Supply Systems (NSSS), e.g. refueling.
	CONTRACTOR will not directly perform turbine generator work.
	CONTRACTOR will not be required to provide technical services of the sort that TVA normally obtains from boiler manufacturers.

Limitations: 
Work associated with the following items ordinarily will not be performed by the CONTRACTOR, but CONTRACTOR may be used to support these efforts:
	Work associated with TVAs Environmental and Clean Air Strategy Projects unless agreed to between TVA and the CONTRACTOR.
	Work associated with the construction of new TVA generation projects (e.g. Combustion Turbines, Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, etc.)
	Work associated with the replacement of steam generators at TVA nuclear plants.
	Work deemed specialty work by TVA (e.g. roofing, paving, fencing, elevator repairs, work on transmission towers, etc.)
	Work associated with the completion and/or commencement of commercial operations of TVAs Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 2.  
CONTRACTOR may be required to furnish to TVA under TVA supervision, augmented personnel for projects supporting work associated with:

	Turbine generator work
	TVAs Power Service Shop
	Short term staffing for projects to address temporary peaks, gaps or specialized needs
	As requested by TVA to meet business objectives

TVA desires to select one or more firm(s) with a history of successful experience in generating plant modification, outage and supplemental maintenance work, but will entertain proposals from joint ventures or other teaming arrangements of firms which have such experience.  TVA seeks to determine whether it would be in TVAs best interest to have one CONTRACTOR provide all modification, outage and supplemental maintenance work at TVAs fossil, nuclear, and hydro generating plants, and possibly work at other TVA controlled facilities, and strongly encourages proposals from firms willing and able to perform that full scope of work.  However, TVA will also consider proposals from vendors who are willing and able to perform less than that full scope, e.g. work at nuclear sites only.

The following is a brief summary of the magnitude of potential work.

1.	Nuclear

CONTRACTOR agrees to provide the services of qualified personnel to perform modification, outage and supplemental maintenance services, and technical support (excluding design engineering services) services at Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, and Watts Bar Nuclear Plants operating units.  All craft labor will be obtained through union referral process.  During a typical outage season, nuclear will have a minimum of 1 unit in outage and a maximum of 2 at different plant locations in Rhea and Hamilton Counties, Tennessee and in Limestone County, Alabama.  Such nuclear outages normally are not scheduled concurrently with each other.  The annual managed task estimated labor man hours for a fiscal year could be as many as 1,100,000 once CONTRACTORs work is fully implemented.

CONTRACTOR agrees to provide as requested by TVA, augmented personnel under the direct supervision of TVA.  The estimated annual augmentation labor man hours for a fiscal year could be as many as 250,000 once CONTRACTORs work is fully implemented.

2.	Non-Nuclear - Fossil Managed

CONTRACTOR agrees to provide the services of qualified personnel to perform modification, outage and supplemental maintenance services, and technical support (excluding design engineering services) services at TVAs 11 Fossil Plants (59 units), 29 Conventional Hydro generating plants (109 units), 20 non-power dams, one Pumped Storage facility, Power Service Shops (located in Muscle Shoals, AL), and other sites located within the TVA region.  All craft labor will be obtained through union referral process.  During a typical outage season, Fossil will have 6 - 11 units in outage at possibly 6 - 11 different locations and Hydro will have 10 to 18 outages at the same time as fossil located throughout the Tennessee Valley.  Of the units in outage, 2 - 3 outages could start on the same date with the other outages having staggered starting dates.

The estimated annual managed task labor man hours for a fiscal year could be as many as the following once CONTRACTORs work is fully implemented:

Fossil - 2.5 million 
Hydro - 385 thousand
Power Service Shop - 100 thousand


CONTRACTOR agrees to provide as requested by TVA augmented personnel under the direct supervision of TVA.  The estimated annual augmentation labor man hours for a fiscal year could be as many as the following once CONTRACTORs work is fully implemented:

Fossil Plant Support (spread across 11 plants):  200 - 450 thousand
Power Service Shops Support:  550 - 650 thousand (Valley Wide)
Other non nuclear organizations:  550 - 650 thousand

TVA also desires to evaluate an option of the CONTRACTOR providing Protective Coatings work across the valley.  The estimated man hours for this work is approximately 125,000.  TVA will request in the CONTRACTORs proposal an option to provide this service.

TVA seeks Respondents that have demonstrated the ability to manage and execute the magnitude of potential work associated with this scope.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will contain mandatory minimum requirements including, but not limited to the following.  If your company can meet the items shown below, contact Richard D. Garrett (see below for contact information) to express an interest in receiving a RFP.  All interested bidders are required to contact Richard D.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) has a need for textile fabrication services for a wide range of textile prototype items. This service will address surge demands for textile prototype fabrication that will supplement internal NSRDEC textile prototyping/ fabrication capabilities.  This requirement is oriented towards incremental designs and concept/developmental items.  As such, fabrication quantities are expected to be between 1 and 200 items.  Items fabricated under this contract will be evaluated and tested by the Government to enable continued/iterative design improvements and evaluation en route to a final design.  A key attribute of this contract is to replicate, to the greatest practical extent, the internal NSRDEC capability for prototype fabrication of textile items.  This capability is characterized by emphasis on certain characteristics such as timely and frequent face-to-face collaboration between the fabricator (contractor) and Government designers, rapid turnaround and delivery of fabricated items, and Government retention of unlimited rights to all technical data resulting from the collaborative and incremental fabrication process.<BR>The Draft Statement of Work and other attachments are available on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm) website under W911QY09R0016 and the Natick Contracting website (www3.natick.army mil (Business Opportunities/Upcoming Acquisitions/W911QY-09-R-0016). The Government anticipates making multiple awards, but reserves the right to make a single multiple or no awards. This requirement is a total 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code for these items is 541490, and the business size standard is $6,500,000.00. This is not a request for proposals (RFP).  The Government intends to make multiple Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) awards as a result of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Successful vendors will receive a guaranteed minimum order and will have the opportunity to compete on subsequent Task Orders. The Government anticipates a five year ordering period with One (1) Base Year and Four (4) Option Years.  Comments relating to this synopsis should be submitted via email to Kevin Parker, at kevin.james.parker@us.army.mil no later than 15 January 2009. The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 19 January 2009 and will be open for thirty (30) days.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors to dredge and dispose by mechanical or hopper dredge, approximately 50,000 cubic yards of material from 4-5 different locations throughout the Cape Cod Canal.  The maintenance material to be dredged and disposed consists of medium to coarse granular material, primarily gravel and sand.  Disposal will be at the off shore Cape Cod Canal Disposal site.  The dredging is to remove shoals that will restore the 32 foot deep sea level canal (mean lower low water), plus 2 feet overdepth.  Tide range in the Canal varies from 4.0 feet at the west end (Buzzards Bay) to 9 feet at east end (Cape Cod Bay).  In addition to differing in range, the tides in these two bays differ in phase and mean tide level.  As a result, the currents in the Canal change direction approximately every 6 hours, and reach an average maximum velocity of 4-4.5 knots, with moon and spring tides achieving 6 knots.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a Size Standard of $20,000,000.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis.  The estimated issue date for the procurement is on or about  30 January 2009.          .  Interested bidders can download the solicitation via the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).  The due date for the bid will be stated in the solicitation.  Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, fax, or email will not be honored.  Instructions for bid submissions will be provided in the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a bid for consideration by the New England District.

<DESC><p>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<br />---------------<br />A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Knee Immobilizers for its 7 Army, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and US Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF's) in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan in the Heartland Region including institutional and operational healthcare settings. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I.
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. The seven facilities in the area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City Michigan.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is May 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Knee Immobilizers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $16,179.21. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<br />1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Knee Immobilizers products for single use. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: IMMOBILIZER KNEE 18inL UNIVERSAL PERF-VINYL/FOAM MEDIAL/LATERAL/POSTERIOR STAY HOOK AND LOOP STRAPS; IMMOBILIZER KNEE TRIMMABLE 23inL UNIVERSAL NYLON/FOAM LAMINATE ADJUSTABLE MEDIAL/LATERAL/CONTOUR POST STAY HOOK AND LOOP STRAPS; IMMOBILIZER KNEE TRIMMABLE 23inL UNIVERSAL ADJ MEDIAL/LATERAL LOOP LOCK STRAPS; KNEE IMMOBILIZER 18 CUTAWAY F; KNEE IMM TRI PANEL (CB) 19 UN; IMMOBILIZER KNEE 24inL UNIVERSAL FOAM MEDIAL/LATERAL/POSTERIOR STAY HOOK AND LOOP STRAPS; IMMOBILIZER KNEE 22inL UNIVERSAL NYLON PILE/FOAM LAMINATE ADJUSTABLE MEDIAL/LATERAL STAY HOOK AND LOOP STRAPS PATELLA CLOSED w/STRAP; IMMOBILIZER KNEE TRIMMABLE 20inL FOAM ADJUSTABLE MEDIAL/LATERAL/CONTOUR POST STAY HOOK &amp; LOOP STRAPSX PATELLA CLOSED w/STRAP; and IMMOBILIZER KNEE 22inL UNIVERSAL NYLON PILE/FOAM LAMINATE ADJ MEDIAL/LATERAL STAY LOOP LOCK STRAPS PATELLA CLOSED w/STRAP.</p>
<p>2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Knee Immobilizer product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <br />5. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />6. Vendors must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (i.e. meets OSHA Standard Industrial Classification {SIC} description for 3842: Orthopedic, Prosthetic, and Surgical Appliances and Supplies) used in manufacturing Orthopedic Soft Goods - Knee products in response to this RFQ. <br />7. Vendors, in response to this RFQ, must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<br />8. Vendors must provide documentation of what type of securement devices your company uses for your knee orthopedic soft goods in response to this RFQ.<br />9. Vendors must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation of what type of lining your company uses for your knee orthopedic soft goods product items.<br />10. Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation explaining any products (i.e. knee brace) with the added features of being static (allowing no range of motion) or dynamic.<br />11. Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation that your products are designed to be worn over or under clothing.</p>
<p><br />Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors' average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors' average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Patient Safety - The product is durable.<br />a. A splint or brace for the lower extremity needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with weight bearing and patient mobility.<br />b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<br />c. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the aterial used to construct the item is acceptable.<br />2. Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight.<br />a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<br />b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<br />c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<br />3. Proper Fit - The product has adjustable securement devices.<br />a. Allows proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body part.<br />b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<br />c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<br />4. Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort to user.<br />a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to allow for patient comfort.<br />b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<br />c. Evaluator will don the product, confirming the comfort of the item is acceptable.<br />5. Patient Safety - Product provides stability.<br />a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body part from further injury.<br />b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<br />c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of the item is acceptable.<br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

TITLE: B-1B AN/APQ-164 Radar - procurement of 134 Modular Receiver/Exciters (MoREs) and 134 Common Radar Processors (CoRPs)
DESCRIPTION: SOURCES SOUGHT The United States Air Force intends to award a single production contract for the purchase of 134 Modular Receiver/Exciters (MoREs), and 134 Common Radar Processors (CoRPs) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). The 812th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG) (B-1 Systems Group) has the System Design and Development (SDD) under contract for these two LRUs with full development  to be completed in January of 2011.  The production contractor will be required to produce, support and maintain, and to integrate the two LRUs and will be required to equip the entire fleet of 67 B-1B aircraft by 2014.  The 812 AESG anticipates awarding a single contract for the production, support and integration of these units in January 2010 following Milestone C approval.
The B-1 radar Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program (RMIP) will provide B-1 combat forces with an updated offensive radar system that reduces existing mission capable (MC) rate problems due to increasing DMS problems of the legacy AN/APQ-164 system.  The existing B-1 radar system is over 20 years old and has not had a hardware upgrade since it was initially fielded in 1985.  RMIP addresses critical sustainability issues on the B-1 weapon system and is required to avoid potential fleet grounding actions as early as the 2010 timeframe.  The RMIP was designated an Acquisition Category (ACAT) II program. The RMIP production effort is replacing the two highest failure rate line replaceable units (LRUs). Under the RMIP production contract the B-1 Radar Receiver Transmitter (RRT) will be replaced with a derivative of the F-16 AN/APG-68 (V)9 receiver, the MoRE, and the B-1 Radar Signal Processor (RSP) will be replaced with a derivative of the F-16 AN/APG-68(V)9 signal processor, the CoRP.  The RMIP is leveraging existing proprietary technology from F-16 APG-68(V)9 program to update the legacy AN/APQ-164 Offensive Radar System (ORS).  The RMIP SDD Program is responsible for designing, developing, and integrating the B-1 Radar Modes with the two new LRUs, the MoRE and the CoRP.  The MoRE and the CoRP were developed under a previous risk reduction effort at OC-ALC/327-CSSG.  Following the completion of mode development and laboratory testing on the BAC 1-11, Northrop Grummans flying test aircraft, the 812 AESG in conjunction with the Operational Test Agency for the program will prepare for an Operational Assessment (OA) for the RMIP Program.  A successful OA is one of the entrance criteria for a Milestone C decision, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). Milestone C for LRIP is planned for January 2010 with kit installs required to start in FY11 and be completed in FY14.  RMIP will retain the dual-string hardware configuration of the existing AN/APQ-164.  The SDD designed MoRE and CoRP LRUs are backward compatible for form, fit, and functional equivalents to the legacy LRUs to physically interface or interconnect with or become an integral part of the existing B-1 AN/APQ-164 Radar System.  In addition the shape, size, dimensions, mass, weight, and other physical parameters must conform to the AN/APQ-164 Radar System, and the LRUs must meet the same action or actions of the AN/APQ-164 Radar System.  Additionally, there is no Group A or software interface changes from the legacy to the RMIP system.  The production kit for each B-1 aircraft will be comprised of two MoREs, two CoRPs, two adapter cables, two interconnect cables, and two brackets. For production, the only production design change from SDD anticipated at this time is the potential for a second handle on the MoRE.
The United States Air Force has limited data rights to MoRE and CoRP hardware architecture, design, and documentation.
Envisioned production Contract Requirements: 1) 4 lots of MoRE and CoRP LRUs, at least 67 kits in total from 2010-2013 (268 total, 134 MoRE and 134 CoRP LRUs).  2) 4 lots of MoRE and CoRP spares and support equipment including 36 MoREs, 41 CoRPs, 26 I/F Cables, 26 Adapters, and 4 Universal System Test Benches (USTBs) from 2010 to 2013 (2 at MOBs, 2 at OC-ALC). 3) Engineering changes to be cut-in to production MoREs and CoRPs and interfaces with the B-1B radar system.  4) Retrofit of hardware or software changes with B-1B software block upgrades.  5) All tech orders necessary for three-level maintenance.  6) All requirements that support install on the B-1 and to interface with the existing B-1 weapon system.
The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine if there are any businesses available who are capable of providing the supplies described herein. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This is in support of market research being conducted by the Air Force to identify capable potential sources.  The 812th Aeronautical Systems Group will be assessing the level of market interest and competitiveness to this acquisition based on responses to the following: 1. Does your firm have knowledge of the entire B-1B fleet and the AN/APG-164 radar system (Include past performance ratings/evaluations such as Contractor Performance Assessment Ratings (CPARs), Award Fee Determinations, or similar contract incentives to verify this assertion)? 2. What strengths does your firm have that enhance and/or exceed the current MoRE and CoRP requirements?  3. Do you have past experience with the B-1B/AN/APG-164 radar system or similar aircraft/programs?  4. Does your firm have qualified personnel available to support onsite maintenance/sustainment activities?  5. Can your firm administer Type-1 training for the USTB to depot and operational maintenance personnel?  6. Can your firm build MoREs, CoRPs, to current design and specification requirements at rates of 22 kits per year with all needed spares and support equipment beginning in 2010?  7. Can your firm support a kitproof of MoREs and CoRPs on a B-1B aircraft at the beginning of LRIP to include a draft TCTO and T.O. verification?  8. Can your firm support possible engineering changes to the MoREs and CoRPs that result from failures in B-1B flight test in CY 2009? Can your firm roll those possible hardware and software changes into the MoRE and CoRP design prior to LRIP start in January 2010?  9. During LRIP, can your firm support integration of a concurrent MoRE and CoRP software upgrade program?

<DESC><p>MISSILE ALERT FACILITY (MAF) CCTV <br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />The scope of work for this project includes the installation of government furnished Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system to include but is not limited to, four Bosch Prepackaged Fixed Day Night Camera (Part #KBE-495V28-20), four pan-tilt-zoom cameras (three VG4-323-ECS0W and one VG4-323-ECS0M), a monitor (19RTLB), a digital video recorder (DB12C2025D2), power supplies (four VG4-A-PSU1 for Autodomes and one ALTV2416600UL3 for fixed cameras), and at least two infrared illuminators (Extreme CCTV UFLED30-8BD and UFLED60-8BD). One of the PTZ cameras will be pole mounted outside the MAF fence on the left side of the access road as you approach the MAF. This will require trenching and conduit from the pole to the garage (F.E. Warren and Minot AFBs) or to the exterior telephone box (Malmstrom AFB). Existing conduit will then be used to reach the monitoring location inside the Security Control Center. The cameras will be installed to provide 360 degree viewing of the MAF to include the MAF fence line and 25 meters beyond. On some sites the topography may require the use of existing light poles to elevate cameras. The poles will require additional stiffening to limit movement in high wind condition. The infrared illuminators will be located on structures or existing poles in such a way as to illuminate dark areas of the MAF where the cameras are not capable of detecting intruders due to poor lighting. The contractor will provide and install all required conduit, conductors, connectors, hardware and sufficient uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units for the system to operate a minimum of 10 minutes. The system will be installed at 45 geographically separated MAFs. The MAFs are located throughout Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska. Each facility will have its own stand-alone CCTV system. Installation at all locations shall be completed in 120 days from Notice to Proceed of Construction Phase. This may be set aside for small business or an 8a depending on the capabilities of the firm to accomplish all work within the 120 day time frame.

	SCOPING STUDY: AIR QUALITY IMPACTS REPORT UPDATE and ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT

INTRODUCTION
Every five years the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Gulf of Mexico Region prepares Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for the proposed 5-Year Leasing Programs and lease sales.  MMS develops scenarios for the EIS which are then analyzed for possible impacts.  The scenarios for the 5-year program and lease sales are largely hypothetical because it is not known at the time what operations will actually take place.  The scenarios for EISs include information about: the numbers of wells that might be drilled and the discharges that might result from drilling the wells; the numbers of production platforms that might be installed and the types and amounts of activity needed to support platform operations; and the methods that might be used to transport the oil and gas that are produced. 
The EIS analyzes estimates for the nature, severity, and duration of impacts that might occur and compares impacts of the proposed actions and alternatives.   Numerous technical aids are used in making the assessment, e.g., computer models that simulate the movements of accidental oil spills or air emissions from operations.  Much of the air quality impacts analysis is based on methodology/data derived from an MMS commissioned report entitled, Air Quality Impact of Proposed OCS Lease Sale No. 95, 1989, Jacobs Engineering Group, Pasadena, CA.  To insure the most accurate EIS assessment of air quality impacts possible, it is necessary to evaluate the  Jacobs 1989 report to determine if the analysis, assumptions and algorithms used for offshore California in 1989 are pertinent to 2008 oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). 
STUDY OBJECTIVES
Scope the feasibility and estimate costs for evaluation and updating, as necessary, the Air Quality Impact of Proposed OCS Lease Sale No. 95, 1989, Jacobs Engineering Group report, to insure the most accurate information is being used when developing air emissions used for EIS impacts analyses.  A second objective: to scope the feasibility and estimated costs for development of an algorithm that would take, as input, the MMS EIS oil and gas production forecasts and transportation scenarios and produce emissions to be used in EIS impacts analyses.
Provided a copy of the Jacobs 1989 report, perform the following specific objectives:

1. Scope evaluation and updating, where necessary, the Jacobs 1989 report.2. Scope development of an algorithm and associated software (spreadsheet) that would produce emissions to be used in future EIS air quality impacts analyses.

SCOPE OF WORK
In this study, MMS needs an assessment of the feasibility and estimated costs for updating of the Jacobs 1989 report, including a detailed analysis of the applicability of the findings of this report to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico in 2008. Also needed is an assessment of the feasibility and estimated cost for developing algorithms and software that would convert the EIS scenario to emissions that could be used in NEPA air quality impacts assessments.
 General Program Scheduling
The period of performance (POP) for this Project is three months The POP shall encompass all tasks from initial planning, through and including MMSs final acceptance of the deliverable. 
Tasks 
Task 1.    Evaluation/Update Jacobs 1989 Report
The Contractor shall submit a detailed report describing the companys estimate for evaluating and updating the document. The contractor shall describe in detail references and methodology to be employed.             		 Task 2.  Algorithm/Software Development
The Contractor shall submit a detailed report describing the companys estimate algorithm/software development. The contractor shall describe in detail references and methodology to be employed.  

Deliverable.  The following deliverable shall be submitted to MMS, as specified by the tasks above:
Two scoping reports with detailed estimates, references and methodology for: 1) evaluating and updating the Jacobs 1989 document and; 2) algorithm/software development references and methodology.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Northeast and Caribbean Region is conducting a market survey and is seeking sources for Site Preparation. The requirements for this opportunity include two phases: Phase 1 - Rock Removal, and Phase 2 - Site Infrastructure for the Construction of a New United States Land Port of Entry (LPOE) at Alexandria Bay, New York. This project is presently being designed by the firm of Morphosis Architects of Santa Monica, California. Construction is anticipated to begin April 20, 2009. 

The current estimated construction cost range is $10,000,000 to $15,000,000. The estimated project construction duration is 8 months (240 days). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 238910 and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $14 million in annual receipts averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years. 

The scope of work includes the following: all work necessary for preparing the site for the future proposed facility expansion.  

Phase 1: The work shall consist of native rock removal and site preparation inclusive of work in the following areas: demolition of pavements, demolition of structures, clearing and grubbing, rock removal, processing and stockpiling of native rock, 

Phase 2: Excavation and grading, asphalt paving, concrete paving, storm sewers, roadway signage, site lighting and site utilities. 

The contractor shall ensure that all special requirements that have been incorporated into the project including maintaining traffic safety and ensuring uninterrupted facility operations are met. 

The site geology is composed of metamorphosed igneous units and it is anticipated that there will be significant amounts of rock removal required in order to construct the project.  The project will require work to be performed immediately adjacent to the existing LPOE without any disruption to the operations of the existing facility. The existing facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 

This work is in support of, and will be coordinated with, the larger new Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, NY project issued under Solicitation No. GS-02P-08-DTC-0011N.

<a href="mailto:barbara.dejoie@mms.gov">Dejoie, Barbara</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Minerals Management Service (MMS) intend to award a firm fixed price sole source contract to Delmar Systems Inc., for an Automated Risk Assessment Tool.Automated Risk Assessment Tool for Moored Mobile Offshore Drilling Units in the Gulf of Mexico During Hurricane Season Background The effects of Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Rita during the 2004, 2005, and 2008 hurricane seasons were detrimental to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico. These effects included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles, drilling rigs, and pipelines. During Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike there were 21 moored rigs that experienced a total failure of station-keeping ability.  Fortunately, these hurricanes did not cause any loss of life or significant pollution because of industrys ability to secure wells and evacuate personnel successfully.  However, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Gulf of Mexico Region (GOMR) is concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs, as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms.  In an effort to reduce these effects, real and potential, the MMS GOMR has set forth guidance to ensure compliance with 30 CFR 250.417 and to improve performance in the area of moored mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) station-keeping during the environmental loading that may be experienced during hurricanes.Industry, the U.S. Coast Guard, and MMS have worked together to develop recommended practices for the use of moored MODUs during the 2006, 2007, and 2008 hurricane seasons.  Part of these efforts resulted in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 2SK, Appendix K, Gulf of Mexico Mooring Practice for Hurricane Season.  The precursor to API 2SK, Appendix K was API RP 95F (1st Edition for 2006 and 2nd Edition for 2007).  Both API RP 95F Editions state that probability and consequences of a MODU losing station should be assessed.   Both API RP 95F Editions developed an Appendix I Checklist tool.  However, neither Appendix Checklist fully assessed risk to the degree that the document itself discussed. On average, the MMS GOM reviews sixty mooring analysis reports during hurricane season. For the 2006, 2007, and 2008 hurricane seasons, the MMS GOM required a mooring analysis (at a minimum, the API RP 95F Appendix I was completed and sent in as part of their mooring analysis.)   The depth of the mooring analysis reports varied greatly.  This variation sometimes made approval decision making difficult.  It was found that a better and more consistent decision could be made on the locations where operators submitted an in-depth risk assessment.  The use of an automated detailed risk assessment tool would ensure proper assessments are being performed consistently.  This could subsequently reduce the risk of mooring failures from occurring within the GOM.

Scope of ProjectThe MMS is looking to purchase a software program or a license to utilize an automated risk assessment tool for moored MODUs that includes both the consequence and probability of failure/damage in the GOM during hurricane season.  The vendor shall deliver a complete, defect-free version of the tool within the timeframe specified.  The vendors risk assessment tool should have the capability to incorporate updated information as it becomes available.  This information may include metocean data, future tropical system data, MODU reliability, or any other information deemed pertinent to the MMS.RequirementsFor all moored MODU locations in the GOM during hurricane season, MMS needs an automated risk assessment tool with the following functionality: Would be ready for use on or before April 1, 2008; delivered to the MMS on or before March 10 to allow for training and testing. Automatically calculates an in-depth risk analysis that compares the probability to the consequence.  These outputs of risk should be shown both graphically and in a table format (ranking them in order from highest risk to the lowest risk). Given a MODU location, the tool needs to:Automatically populate surface and subsurface infrastructure at a minimum of 50 miles in all directions Be able to calculate the throughput for each pipeline segment Be able to calculate the throughput for each facility (platform) Generate an infrastructure map Allow the production and infrastructure data within the tool to agree with the MMS database (http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/pubinfo/freeasci/freedesc.html )  The following should be considered when the tool calculates the probability:For the probability of mooring failure, each component of the mooring system should be considered Historical analysis of failure data of mooring equipment should be used A reliability analysis should be included for each component Safety factors for irregularities and/or damaged equipment should be used Consideration should be given to installation and inspection procedures Information taken from the Factor of Safety Limit State Curves should be considered for the probability of damage, the tool should assess probability of damage to wells, manifolds, pipelines, and surface facilities Consideration should be given to the type of mooring equipment and the damage that type of equipment may cause to surrounding infrastructure at the calculated distances Directionality should be considered  The following should be considered when the tool calculates the consequence:Both surface and subsurface consequences should be calculated using production volumes and repair/replacement costs Subsurface consequence should include wells, manifolds, pipelines contained in the MMS database.Surface consequence should include caissons, fixed structures, tension leg platforms, semi-submersibles, and spars contained in the MMS database  For appropriate metocean data, the tool should look at historical tropical storm/hurricane data for the given location and duration the MODU will be on location and list that data graphically and in a table format The tool should be flexible enough to consider whether the return period contains full population, seasonal, site-specific, or 2INT-MET data Deliverables The vendor shall provide: A trial version of the assessment tool to the MMS on or before February 1, 2009.   After a successful trial period, a final/revised version of the assessment tool to the MMS on or before March 1, 2009. The assessment tool will be compatible with the MMS networking system.  MMS plans on installing the tool on a central server and allow up to 5 users simultaneously.The vendor shall warrant a defect-free product for one calendar year after acceptance of the product.  Deliverables will be accepted by the MMS within 90 days after acceptance unless, or until they are found to be defective.  The MMS will return defective products to the vendor for correction at no additional cost to the MMS.  The corrected products shall be returned to the MMS within ten calendar days of receipt.  Proposal Evaluation CriteriaFor each proposal, the following criteria, listed in order of importance, will be evaluated: The degree to which the vendors proposal demonstrates an understanding on how to automatically calculate the risk associated with moored mobile offshore drilling units in the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. The timeliness in which the vendor can provide a defect-free tool. The price estimates provided by the vendor.  The MMS will evaluate the quoted price for reasonableness which can be conducted by utilizing various  price analysis techniques.This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honered. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in support of Homeland Security.  Within this area, NSWC PCD performs a full spectrum of research, development and acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; logistics; and development of operational concepts and tactics. NSWC PCD is interested in receiving white papers for research and development in the area of Homeland Security.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2.  It is intended that this BAA be open from 8 January 2009 to 30 Sep 2009.
Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) multifunction underwater sensing designs and technology; (2) image and sensor data processing; (3) innovative conventional and non-conventional systems for homeland security; (4) Chemical / Biological individual protection.  White papers may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. NSWC PCD encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the t! opic (although NSWC PCD reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NSWC PCD is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC PCD is seeking white papers for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. White papers for evolutionary engineering of improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed. 
In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or white papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC PCD specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC PCD programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC PCD with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offe! rors capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC PCD using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding.  Initial contractor selection can be expected during the third or forth quarter of FY-09.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. 
For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is de! termined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause , the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award. If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation. White papers may b! e submitted by any commercial firm, or institution of higher education. There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin. White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA. There is no set date for submission.  The World Wide Web page for NSWC PCD may be accessed for additional information regarding the mission, programs and objectives of the activity at http:\\www.ncsc.navy.mil. The following e-mail points of contact are provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by NSWC PCD:  Timothy S (Scott) Chandler (timothy.chandler@navy.mil) and Robert L Maddox (robert.maddox@navy.mil).

<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request forInformation (RFI).  The government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicitated under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid but merely a request for information.
Request for InformationProgram: M2 Magnetic CompassCategory: Legacy SustainmentPM Office: PM MortarsARDEC Office: Mortars and Common Fire Control
Purpose:	The government would like to query industry for technological solutions and expertise to address the need to improve the M2 Magnetic Compass.
Overview:	The current M2 Magnetic Compass assembly is comprised of a magnetic needle compass, a clinometer for measuring angles of sight in the vertical plane, a front and rear leaf sight for establishing a line of sight, and an adjustable mirror for viewing the compasss azimuth and clinometer scales while sighting. A circular level vial is to provide for indicating the level position of the compass box. An azimuth scale adjusting mechanism provides the setting of the declination constant. A needle lifting mechanism is incorporated to lift the compass needle from its pivot to secure it when it is not in use.	The M2 Compass functions as an alternate means of accurately pointing a mortar system for firing.
Reference Documents: 	MIL-C-58052 Compass, Magnetic, Unmounted: M2
Objective:	The M2 Magnetic Compass Redesign & Re-engineering objective is to update the compass to current military specifications and to redesign it with key features to improve design and operation.

Desired Attributes:
	Illumination:  The illumination solution, if other than tritium, will provide a minimum of 1 year service life with an objective service life of 4 years. An On/Off solution will be utilized to save battery life. An adjustable aperture or dimmable light source is desired. An alternate solution may also be a phosphorescent material to illuminate the compass or to indicate markings on the compass dial.
	Size:  Currently thickness is measured to not exceed 1 5/16; a re-engineering threshold of 1 with an objective of .75 is desired. Overall size should not increase.
	Weight:  Currently weight is measured to not exceed 10 oz.; a re-engineering threshold of 8oz. with an objective of 6oz. is desired.

	Clinometer:  The clinometer scale is currently identified at 20 mil intervals and numbered at every 200 mils using hundreds and thousand digits. The re-engineering objective would be to increase the graduations to 10 mil intervals and numbered every 100 mils using hundreds and thousands digits while maintaining or improving the current readability and accuracy (see MIL-C-58052C sec 3.7.6).
	Azimuth:  The Azimuth scale is currently identified at 20 mil intervals and numbered at every 200 mils using hundreds and thousand digits. The re-engineering objective would be to increase the graduations to 10 mil intervals and numbered every 100 mils using hundreds and thousands digits while maintaining or improving current readability and accuracy (see MIL-C-58052C sec 3.7.7).
	Lanyard:  Add/Attach a lanyard loop to the housing of the compass without hampering the function of the compass.
	Mirror:  Research and develop new/better adhesives or attachment methods to survive fielding. The current mirror loses its adhesive bond to the cover housing due to the cover housing being bent or warped during use in the field.
RFI responses will be accepted in electronic submission.  All proprietary and restricted information provided in responses to this RFI should be clearly marked.  Responses should indicate if the vendor is a large or small business.  Please ensure you have included your e-mail address, mailing address and telephone number in the body of the response.  All responses shall be in English language.  Responses must be submitted to Marcus Edmundson at Marcus.Edmundson@us.army.mil.  Responses are due on or before COB 9 FEB 2009.

<p>January 08, 2009
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />Reporting for FEMA Western Parishes <br />Demolition and Debris Removal Activities<br />As a Result of Hurricane Rita<br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has completed archaeological monitoring of approximately 565 individual monitoring events in Cameron, Calcasieu and Vermillion Parishes. The monitoring of both demolition and private property debris removal activities resulted in artifact collection at 9 previously recorded sites and the identification of 7 previously unrecorded sites. (Collectively referred to as the Sites). A total of 423 artifacts were collected during the investigations and are presently located in FEMA's Louisiana Transitional Recovery Office (TRO) at 1250 Poydras, New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
<p>I. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>There are two objectives to be accomplished under this Scope of Work:<br />A. Written reports, in acceptable form, detail and content, that reflect the activities and ensuing discoveries noted above, the historical background, site forms, outstanding literature and contemporaneous notes, with respect to the Sites (the Reports); and,<br />B. Written analysis and curation of the collected artifacts, completion of the necessary site forms and documents or reports as may be required to complete the Reports referred to in Section A. of this Part I.</p>
<p>II. SERVICES <br />The contractor shall perform in a timely and professional manner all work described below:</p>
<p>Background Research</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct background research as it deems necessary and prudent to the carrying out of the tasks hereunder. At a minimum, background research will include an examination of the records on file at the Louisiana Division of Archaeology and the Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation, relevant property records, historic maps, and archive research. All notes, copies of documents, maps and the like, as are necessary to a full understanding of the data set out in the Reports, shall be collected and placed in an appendix, or appendices in the order of first reference in the Report to which it is attached.<br /><br />Data Analysis</p>
<p>The contractor shall synthesize all notes, site forms, literature and records compiled during the investigations into a Report. All of the approximately 565 individual monitored demolition and private property debris removal events have associated monitoring forms and other documentation which will provide the basis for data synthesis and analysis. These materials will be made available to the contractor at the TRO offices as soon after the award as possible.</p>
<p>Artifact Analysis and Curation</p>
<p>All collected artifacts shall be curated in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation as well as those guidelines stipulated by the Louisiana Division of Archaeology. Contractor and FEMA shall establish a protocol for the hand-over and subsequent tracking of the artifacts until permanently curated. All artifacts must be labeled and packaged for permanent curation. At such time or times as contractor and FEMA agree, the artifacts shall be submitted to the Louisiana Division of Archaeology or a state approved Deputy Custodian for long-term curation.</p>
<p>Site Form and Report Preparation</p>
<p>Contractor will complete all technical reports of the archaeological monitoring in Cameron, Calcasieu and Vermillion Parishes. A separate report will be required for each parish, written in accordance with the standards and guidelines set forth by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (Federal Register 48(190) 1983:44716-44737) and as the Louisiana State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) Division of Archaeology monitoring report standards (http://www.crt.state.la.us/archaeology/REVIEW/MonRep.shtml). Technical reports and parish reports are considered as part of the Reports and will be contained in the final version of each Report submitted by contractor to FEMA.</p>
<p>The technical reports shall, at a minimum, include a description of the study area; equipment used; observed demolition techniques; relevant historic documentation, maps and background research; the field studies/investigations; all field observations; a discussion of the methodology; analyses and results illustrated with appropriate tables, charts, and graphs; an evaluation of the investigations in terms of the goals and objectives of the investigations; an eligibility determination if appropriate; management recommendations; a bibliography; and updated site forms.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Schedule</p>
<p>Work will begin, starting with the background research, within five business days of award (the Start Date). Not later than 8weeks from the Start Date, 6 copies of a draft report for each parish (18 total), and a digital copy of each draft on CD, shall be submitted to FEMA TRO Historic Preservation Department at 1250 Poydras Street. Following a review and comments by FEMA and the Louisiana SHPO of the drafts, contractor will incorporate recommended changes into a final Report for each parish. Submission of final Reports shall occur not later than two weeks from the date contractor receives comments from the State and FEMA. Six copies of a final Report for each parish (18 total) and a digital copy of each Report on CD, will be submitted to the Historic Preservation staff at FEMA. <br />Upon submission of the final Reports, in form and substance satisfactory to FEMA, all artifacts collected and processed as a result of the monitoring, and in the same condition as originally received, shall be submitted by the contractor for curation. Contractor shall provide FEMA with written evidence of the proper transfer of all artifacts to the appropriate permanent curation with the State of Louisiana.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Time and Material quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0024 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28 effective December 12, 2008. This is a Full and Open RFQ under NAICS 541512 with a size standard of $25 million. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. An award will be issued to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on the following: 1. Technical Understanding and Approach. The Government will assess the vendors Quality Control methodology; qualifications, experience and suitability of quoted personnel (as demonstrated in formal rsums submitted for all personnel).  As such interested vendor's response must indicate an understanding of the processes and work enumerated in the PWS. 2. Relevant Past Performance.  The Government will assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar, relevant work (including magnitude of the project and the nature of the facility), to include the ability to control the quality and cost of work and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous similar relevant work.  Vendors are requested to submit no more than 5 references for relevant past performance.  Submission should include contact information for ordering entity, including a point of contact, dollar value of contract/order, brief description of work performed, and an explanation of how any performance difficulties were addressed and resolved. If the interested vendor has no relevant past performance, an affirmative statement that no relevant past performance exists must be submitted. 3. Price. The factors of Technical Understanding and Approach and Relevant Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI9028 issued as a Notice of Intent.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-28.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern.   The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238990, which has a size standard of $13.0 million.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to procure on a sole source basis from Stuart Dean Company the following: continued maintenance services for the terrazzo marble floor in our building 40 facility, which is located on the National Institutes of Health campus.  The requirement consists of monthly maintenance of the following: 1) 4,200 square feet of terrazzo marble in 1st floor public area; 2) elevator lobby; 3) steps leading to North rotunda entrance; 4) landing at base of stairs; 5) areas to be refinished will be completely masked and covered with protective paper and plastic to ensure integrity of delicate finishes adjacent to marble, such as bronze and wood; 6) all light to medium scratches will be removed using abrasive means including resin-bonded diamond pads and sand screens in conjunction with a weighted floor machine; 7) a powdered mixture of oxalic acid, aluminum oxide and water will be used as a polishing compound under a 19 natural fiber-polishing pad; 8) once even polished is achieved, all polishing slurry will be removed by use of a water vacuum, followed by a two-step neutralizing process achieved by flooding the polished area with ph balanced stone soap; and 9) vitrification or crystallization of marble will be performed to improve the floors, slip co-efficient and enhance the hardness of shine, per manufacturers specifications utilizing specially low-rotation floor machine and #2 Texsteel steel wool pads.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

It is estimated that Veterans in the areas identified below may be eligible for one or more of the above indicated services.  Offerors shall identify the area(s) of interest by circling the areas covered by their proposal.Vermont: Addison County 					Lamoille County  	Bennington County					Orange County	Caledonia County 					Orleans County	Chittenden County					Rutland County 		Essex County 					Washington County	Franklin County 					Windham County	Grand Isle County					Windsor County				 				 			 							  		  New Hampshire:  Belknap County				Hillsborough County			 	             Carroll County		              		Merrimack County 	              Cheshire County			               Rockingham County                               Coos County 			                Sullivan County 	              Grafton County 			                              				B.  The VA is interested in proposals to provide the identified services in one or multiple areas, listed above.  Respondents should have the capability of performing initial evaluation within thirty (30) days of referral.  Follow-up appointments, when authorized, shall be scheduled no later than thirty (30) days, unless additional authorization is obtained by the VA.   The Government may award one or more contracts resulting from this solicitation based on what is determined to be most advantageous to the VA, price and other factors considered.C.  The contractor shall provide scheduled appointments for hearing testing, earmolds, and fittings, for VA patients at the contractor's established place of business.  Only those services specifically authorized by the VA shall be provided.   It is also the responsibility of the contractor to keep records regarding patients that do not contact them to arrange an appointment, call to cancel an appointment and do not reschedule, or do not arrive for their appointments.  All paperwork regarding unseen patients is the property of the VA, and should be returned to the Audiology Clinic (117) 215 N. Main Street, White River Jct., VT 05009 at the end of the contract period. D.  The contractor shall maintain specific patient care records detailing the examination, assessment, treatment, process performed, training provided, and any recommendations.  Copies of audiological evaluations and hearing aid selections/recommendations shall be furnished to the VA within one (1) week of patient's scheduled visit, for placement in the patient's established VA medical record.  Hearing aid programming, modifications and follow-up need to be recorded and transferred to the VA at the end of the contract period utilizing one of three methods.  First, if the vendor utilizes NOAH 3, the patient's data is to be exported via e-mail, computer disc or CD to the VA.  Second, if the vendor utilizes NOAH 2, a print out must be completed at the end of each session (it is problematic to try and do this after another session is completed) so that it may be provided to the VA.   Third, if a "stand alone" system is utilized by the vendor to program hearing aids, documentation of modifications performed during the hearing aid fitting as well as any subsequent checks must be completed for each session and that information be furnished to the VA at the end of the contract period. E.   The VA has a centralized distribution center for the issuance of hearing aids.  The VA will provide all hearing aids to the contractor, for issuance to the veteran.   Fees for Follow-up appointments will be paid to the contractor in accordance with the above schedule.  F.  The contractor will be notified if the Veteran is eligible for hearing aids through the VA.  In the event that the contractor is not notified of eligibility, and it is determined that a hearing aid would be suitable, contractor will fax a copy of the Veteran's audiogram to the VA Audiology Clinic at (802) 291-6204.  VA will determine whether the Veteran is eligible to obtain hearing aids from the VA.  If additional services are required, VA will provide additional authorization.G.  If the contractor has been notified that the Veteran is eligible for hearing aids, the contractor will be required to identify the appropriate hearing aid recommended as a result of an audiological examination and assessment, from the attached list of hearing aids from two manufacturers: Oticon and Phonak.  The contractor may only choose the models and styles stated on this attached list.  For an In-The-Ear (ITE) style hearing aid, the contractor must fill out the order form and fax it to the VA Prosthetics Department at (802) 296-6312 and mail a copy of the order form to the hearing aid manufacturer with the earmold impression(s).  For a Behind-The-Ear style hearing aid the contractor must fill out the order form and fax it to the VA Prosthetics Department at (802) 296-6312 and mail a copy of the order form to the hearing aid manufacturer.  For earmolds, the contractor will utilize Microsonic Inc., and mail the order form along with the earmold impressions to Microsonic designating the contractor as the shipping address and the VA as the billing address (see attached example).   H.  Hearing aids will be shipped directly to the WRJ VA Prosthetics Department (121), 215 N. Main Street, White River Jct., VT 05009, who will log in the appropriate serial number and certify the aids.  The VA will then forward the hearing aid, along with a VA Form 10-1477a to the contractor.  The contractor will issue the aid to the Veteran and upon issuance have the Veteran sign the VA form 10-1477a documenting that the aid has been received.  The completed form shall then be sent by fax to the VA Prosthetics Department at (802) 296-6312 and the original signature copy forwarded to the VA along with invoices for services.   Earmolds will be shipped directly to the contractor and the yellow copy of the order form, which accompanies the earmold, is to be forwarded to the VA with the invoice for services.    I.  This contract is effective for the period February 2, 2009 through September 30, 2009 with three one-year options to extend.J.  Personnel assigned by the contractor to perform the services covered by this contract shall be licensed in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States or the District of Columbia.  The qualifications of such personnel shall also be subject to review by the VA Chief of Staff and approval by the VA Facility Director.  At a minimum, personnel providing audiology services under this contract shall have the following qualifications: MA or MS degree, plus have obtained a Certification of Clinical Competency in Audiology, through the American Speech & Hearing Association.K.  Equipment utilized in the performance of the required service shall have annual calibration to assure conformity with established National Standards.L.  This contract is subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  The Contractor will be required to certify compliance with the act by signing a Business Associate Agreement  (for more information about this, refer to website http://www.hss.gov/ocr/hipaa/contractprov.html    M.  PAYMENT         (1)  The VA agrees to reimburse the Contractor on a unit basis for resources furnished at the prices listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services portion of this contract.         (2)  Payment of sums due will be paid monthly upon submission (by the contractor) of a properly prepared invoice and receipt in the appropriate VA office.

Neither the beneficiary, nor his/her insurer or any other third party shall be billed by the contractor.   				        (4)  All invoices from the contractor shall be mailed to the following address: 		Fiscal Service (04)		Department of Veterans Affairs		215 North Main Street		White River Jct., VT  05009

<p>3.2 All work that will impact facility power and water will be coordinated and scheduled with the facility manager.</p>
<p>3.3 This effort includes removing excess glycol lines attached to the units in such a way as to ensure the continued use of PAC unit 9 in room 180C (next to 180D).</p>
<p>3.4 Excess glycol and glycol contaminated materials will be removed and disposed of in a manner consistent with state and local environmental regulations.</p>
<p>3.5 Upon completion of all plumbing work a leakage test must be completed and reported to the facility manager.</p>
<p>3.6 All wiring will be removed and disposed of at DRMO.</p>
<p>3.7 All wire ways will be removed so that they terminate above the drop ceiling in 180D and to a safe height in the facility electrical rooms.</p>
<p>3.8 A pull rope will be left in place in each abandoned conduit for possible future installs.</p>
<p>3.9 All disconnected circuits will have their circuit breakers tagged as spares.</p>
<p>3.10 All electrical work shall comply with NEC standards.</p>
<p>3.11 All work shall be accomplished in accordance with all contract specifications, common work practices, and industry and OSHA standards.</p>

Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The offeror should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

 Price Evaluation Factor
 (i)Completeness.  The offeror has submitted a total price, completed all required representations and certifications, and acknowledgement of any amendments.  (ii) Reasonableness.  The Government's determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable based on price analysis.                                                                                               

The offerors initial proposal shall contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted in order to achieve best value.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the highest rated offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation.  

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:    

Offerors are required to submit their proposals in two separate volumes as follows:

Volume I  Technical and Past Performance Proposal: This volume shall contain the Offers Technical Qualifications and Past Performance information. This portion of the proposal to include all data and information required for technical evaluation and should describe how the offeror meets or exceeds the technical qualifications; the proposal should also list the valve sizes available.  The technical proposal shall not include any pricing information.  Two copies of Volume I shall be submitted.

Volume II  Business Proposal: This volume shall include the complete pricing for each valve for the base year and each option period.  Offerors shall include a list of available valve sizes. One copy of Volume II shall be submitted.

The completion and submission of the above items will constitute a proposal and will indicate the offerors unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this combined synopsis and solicitation and any attachments hereto. Objections to any terms and conditions of this solicitation will constitute a deficiency, which will make the offer unacceptable.

Offerors shall provide sufficient technical documentation (including but not limited to:  product literature, specifications) to allow for thorough evaluation of proposal.  Additionally, the vendor shall fully explain their ability to meet the requirements above.  

 Proposal shall specify the Total Price.  Adequate competition is anticipated for this acquisition.  The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Offerors shall submit firm-fixed pricing for all above requirements.  Include commercial price lists and if applicable, any Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) numbers, a point of contact, name and phone number, business size, payment terms, and pricing.  Include any applicable discounts to the Government.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the offeror to meet all specifications and requirements.

OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:

Central Contractor Registration (CCR):  

Offerors shall be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.  Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov; provide DUNS number; Cage Code and TIN.  

Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the quote submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the quote evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Additionally, FAR clause: 52.204-3 TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION (OCT 1998), is included and is a required part of the quote submission process to ensure that the government is informed of your company Taxpayer Identification number.  Also, DFARS clause 252.247-7022 REPRESENTATION OF EXTENT OF TRANSPORTATION BY SEA (AUG 1992), is a required part of the quote submission process and is included for offerors to acknowledge whether transportation of supplies by sea is anticipated under the resultant contract. 

To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.   NOTE:  Any Contractor who is not registered in CCR will NOT get paid.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.

The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  

Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under  "Help." 

The following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be submitted with an offerors proposal.

Section III. Detailed Proposal Information

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), intends to negotiate with the Arkansas Childrens Hospital (ACH) a three year, sole source contract to conduct a follow-up study of the surviving cohort of preterm infants previously enrolled in grant study number 1-R01-HD36484, title Neurologic Outcomes & Preemptive Analgesia in Neonates (NEOPAIN). The Government is interested in obtaining status and information about the role of pain and its long-term effects on the overall health, well being, cognition, academic skill, executive functions, self regulation, attention and school status of the children now reaching ages 7-9. As a result, the NICHD does not have legal rights to the identifying data on the original cohort of participants. Therefore, the cohort could not be transferred to any other contractor by the NICHD. In order to perform the continued work, a new prospective contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable assessment from infancy. With the exception of the incumbent, ACH, there is no domestic source presently known to the NICHD that has access to such a cohort and ownership of the specific patient population (required for this study) via data from the original NEOPAIN grant. It will cost the Government additional time and effort to duplicate the initial NEOPAIN grant study. All of the factors taken together make the ACH uniquely qualified for carrying out this study. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study which provides for longer follow-up and data analysis. 

This is not a request for proposals. However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement, proposal, or quotation for consideration by the NICHD to the address provided within 45 days of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must document access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subjected to a comparable assessment since infancy. All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.
NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 3 HARD COPIES. 

Capability Statements should be sent to:

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. THIS PRESOLITIATION NOTICE IS A CORRECTED COPY OF THE POSTING OF JANUARY 6, 2008. The Behavioral and Rehabilitation Technology Branch, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana, a component of the Regional Health Authority of Tuscany in Italy. The purpose of the contract is to create a rehabilitation research data resource entitled Community Assessment Rehabilitation Experiment (CARE). A pilot study to examine adaptive physical activity was initiated by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita as part of the research project "Obtaining Optimal Functional Recovery and Efficient Managed Care for the Chronic Stroke Population" within the framework of the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and Italy's Ministry of Health. The study included a community intervention program that was initiated in the Tuscan Region by Dr. Francesco Benvenuti and Dr. Laura Tramonti. The program's impact included safety of the intervention, improvement of gait and balance function and reduction in participants' depression. Community access remains a key issue in translating research results of individuals with chronic conditions who have participated in an exercise regime. The pilot provided an important step in translating the growing evidence regarding the health benefits of exercise for stroke survivors into a sustainable community model that was safe, feasible and efficacious in improving walking speed, and community ambulation. The intervention program demonstrated it has the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs associated with chronic stroke in an aging population through reducing cardiovascular risk factors associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, confirmation of the reduction of costs in health care will require implementation of a community intervention program on a large scale. There are approximately 2,500 individuals in the Tuscan Region who suffer a stroke annually who would be eligible to participate in an expanded study. The Regional Health System completed a pilot study with 40 individuals in the intervention group and 38 individuals in the control group; it will serve as a model to be expanded. The effort involves the leadership of several different Italian Governmental Health groups including: Office of Tuscana Predictive and Preventive Medicine (Andrea Leto); Technology Assessment Office (Alessandro Reggiani); Scuola Superiore Universitaria Sant" Anna of Pisa (Sabrina Nuti); and the Dipartimento Technologie e Salute (Velio Macellari) lead by Dr. Laura Tramonti, General Director of the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Region Toscana. The aforementioned components have worked with the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana and have the experience and necessary affiliations to obtain the data records needed to create the rehabilitation research database. They have completed a pilot study demonstrating applicable data management necessary to link the elements that are required to accomplish the rehabilitation data resource. In addition, the group has developed proprietary software to organize the data. The purpose of the proposed project is to expand this pilot into a computerized rehabilitation research data base that will link separate rehabilitation data components such as pre and post health measures of individuals with a chronic condition (e.g., stroke or back pain, etc.) participating in low cost interventions (e.g. adaptive physical activity) in the community with health services and drug utilization information. Expanded support from NICHD will include study components such as, 1) Establishment of a small Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); 2) expansion of an existing computer based information system; 3) translation of a standardized outcome measure (e.g. SIS, PROMIS); 4) implementation of a telephone interview in the Tuscan region; 5) creation of a patient data file; and, 6) support for collaborative interactions for individuals with chronic conditions. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. The NICHD has determined that the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana in Italy is the only source that can develop a stroke rehabilitation data resource because of their organizational structure, clinical staff scientific expertise and data capability. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must document access to a comparable cohort of stroke victims annually, ownership of a community physical activity intervention program, capacity to generate a de-identified patient record linking the various data elements, and capacity to analyze the data. If any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit, within 45 days of publication of this notice, three (3) copies (plus an electronic copy to ls59u@nih.gov) to: Mrs. Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, NICHD CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Building, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852). Phone number: 301-435-6962 and FAX number: 301-402-3676. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), HHSAR 306.302-1(a) (2) (i) b and c. No collect calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO FIRMS WITH AN ESTABLISHED WORKING OFFICE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF THE VA GULF COAST VETERANS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, 400 VETERANS AVENUE, BILOXI, MS 39531.THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) CONCERNS.  Offers from other than SDVOSB concerns will not be considered and shall be rejected.  The firm must be SMALL under the applicable North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code, which is 541310 with a size standard of $4.5 million, and the firm must be REGISTERED and CURRENT in the following websites to be eligible for award:http://vip.vetbiz.gov,http://www.ccr.gov, and https://orca.bpn.gov .The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS, is seeking an architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, the following.Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square floor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.  A/E shall submit one (1) set of Mylar sepia "as-builts" (each drawing shall be stamped "AS-BUILT" in red ink), and shall submit computer generated material depicting as-built conditions in accordance with all applicable VA Engineering CADD requirements.  A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCAD 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.Qualified firms are required to submit: Two (2) copies of Standard Form (SF) 330 (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms), Part 1 and Part 2 to VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Attn: Cindy Davenport (90C), 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, MS 39531, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Local Time), January 14, 2009.

No solicitation document is available and telephone inquiries will not be honored. NO FAXED OR EMAILED FORMS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the criteria listed in FAR 36.602-1.  Qualifications will also be evaluated based on specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including design of Surgical Suites for VA and other Health Care Facilities.  After the evaluation of submissions in accordance with the evaluation criteria three or more of the most highly qualified firms will be chosen for interviews to present their approach to the design to arrive at selection of the number one firm for negotiations.

<DESC>The current lease for office space in Lebanon Virginia expired on September 30, 2008.  There was no renewal option remaining.  Approvals were obtained from GSA to allow Rural Development to continue to administer the lease.  A market survey was conducted in the area to determine space availability and associated rental rates.  Lebanon Virginia is located in the far southwestern portion of the State and is a very rural area.

The market survey identified three possible locations.  All three were sent copies of the SFO.   In addition, copies of the SFO were sent to four realtors in the area as well as the Chamber of Commerce and the County Administrator.   Two responses to the SFO were received.   Upon review of the responses, it was determined that one could not meet the basic requirements of the SFO.  The other was the current lessor.  Renovations were required to the space to meet IT regulations.  

It was determined to be in the best interest of the Government to award to the current lessor, based on comparables obtained during the market survey process.   Therefore, the lease was awarded to R, S, & J, Inc., at a rate of 17.50 per square foot for a five year period commencing January 1, 2009 thru December 31, 2013.
