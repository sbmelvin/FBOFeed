<DESC>In response to a January 13, 2003, settlement agreement with the American Forest Resources Council (AFRC) and others, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) completed a 5-year review of the northern spotted owl on November 15, 2004, with a recommendation that the owl remain listed as threatened. The January 2003 settlement agreement also established a time frame for the Service to reconsider critical habitat for the northern spotted owl with a proposed critical habitat rule due December 15, 2005, and a final critical habitat rule due by December 15, 2006. In July 2005, through a third amendment to the January 2003 settlement agreement, all parties agreed to extend the deadlines for proposed and final critical habitat rules to December 15, 2006, and December 15, 2007, respectively. This extension was granted to allow the Service time to develop a recovery plan for the northern spotted owl that will also provide the context for critical habitat. The availability of a recent and thorough scientific review of the northern spotted owl, completed as part of the 5-year review process, will allow completion of the draft and final recovery plans for this species in the time allotted. The Service is seeking a Contractor to provide management, scientific, and technical consulting services to lead the Service’s recovery planning process for the northern spotted owl. The Solicitation package will be issued on or about December 2, 2005.  This date is an estimate.  Proposals will be due 30 days after actual issue date.  Proposals will be evaluated using best value/past performance criteria.  For questions of a technical nature please contact Sarah Hall at (503) 231-2071.  For all other questions please contact the contracting officer listed herein.   The solicitation can be obtained at http://ideasec.nbc.gov using the RFP number listed on or after the approximate issue date herein.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Force’s acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE code Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your company’s security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted to the contracting officer via email to annabel.rivera@brooks.af.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL 32407 intends to award a Sole Source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to PTR Group, Inc., 20729 Rainsboro Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147  for analysis of the current Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) C4N Control and Alarms Monitoring System (CAMS) dual networking implementation that consists of two Moxa 508 hubs. The Universal Keyboard system (UKB), Navigation system (NAV), Operator System (OPR), and Common Data Recorder (CDR) computer systems use Intel Proset II software to support Intel teaming and the use of the rSTP (Spanning Tree Protocol IEEE 802.1w). The UKB, NAV and OPR computers use Windows embedded NT SP6 as the operating system and the CDR uses Windows embedded XP SP1. The CAMS computer system uses a modified network driver originally developed by the PTR Group. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The CAMS embedded network drivers require modifica!  tion to support the above mentioned network protocol changes, as well aw the low-level network driver.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for the development of multiplexed screening assays that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment for newborn screening.  The intended goal of the contract is to develop a screening technology platform of components based on a range of technologies that include, but are not limited to: chip technologies, microbead technologies, nanotechnologies, microfluidics, DNA assays, biophysical assays, and technologies based on RNA or proteomics.  Offerors should propose a technology that tests for all conditions or an integrated platform of complementary technologies that can accomplish the screening of groups of conditions, which can be utilized by State Newborn Screening Programs or that can be adapted by large commercial laboratories involved in newborn screening.  The conditions to be addressed might include inborn errors of metabolism, hematological disorders, congenital endocrinopathies, lysosomal storage diseases, immunodeficiency disorders, chromosomal disorders (e.g., fragile X syndrome), or those characterized through control mechanisms of gene expression (e.g., epigenetics).  NICHD prefers that the technology platforms integrate the testing of multiple groups of conditions and link to newborn screening informatic systems.  NICHD is particularly interested in technologies that screen for “high priority” conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, severe combined immunodeficiency, the lysosomal storage diseases – Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease and the mucopolysaccharidoses), which presently lack sensitive and specific tests.  A report, “Newborn Screening: Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System” (http://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), which the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration sponsored and the American College of Medical Genetics developed, identifies some of these “high priority” conditions.  In this solicitation, a “high priority” condition is a condition for which the development of a screening test would make the condition amenable to newborn screening.  Proposals in responses to this solicitation should address the following issues surrounding the development of the technologies: (1) its utility for newborn screening for conditions currently screened within the United States (including its predictive value, sensitivity and specificity); (2) its efficacy of newborn screening for conditions currently screened, comparing the new technology with traditional or alternative techniques; (3) its flexibility (i.e., ability of the technology to facilitate expansion of its multiplexing capabilities to include new conditions in the future); (4) its potential for streamlining and full automation for population screening; (5) its appropriateness, based on the framework of established screening procedures; and, (6) its potential risks and benefits (e.g., ability to detect genetic variance, clinical heterogeneity, carrier status).

The required service is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about December 12, 2005 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov  (FBO).  This acquisition is NOT set-aside for small businesses, i.e., all capable organizations are invited to submit proposals.  While this acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition, proposals must include maximum utilization of small business subcontracting, as appropriate.  Questions should be sent in writing to Paul J. Duska, Contracting Officer, at duskap@mail.nih.gov , or addressed to the same at NICHD, CMB, Executive Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD  20892-7510  ( if sending by overnight carrier-- 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville, Maryland 20852), by fax to 301-402-3676.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS code 541990:     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Chuck Gerba of the University of Arizona. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.  EPA is required to select a new Contaminant Candidate List as required under the 1996 amended SDWA.  EPA has made a regulatory determination on only one microbe from the CCL-1 list.  A lack of current data has  hampered the regulatory determination on the other microorganisms on the CCL list including cyanobacteria and toxins. EPA recently developed mini summaries on the occurrence of 36 microorganisms of concern. Cyanobacteria and toxins was one of them.  There is an urgent need to acquire more data on  the health effects of cyanobacteria one of the microbes on the CCL 36 microbe list completed recently by Dr. Charles Gerba.  This need will be fulfilled by an expert microbiologist who is knowledgeable in the old EPA CCL list and  who completed the occurrence summaries for EPA recently. Because of   time constraints, and the background required for this task, the Office of Water is recommending that Dr. Charles P. Gerba of University of Arizona be asked to handle this urgent task for the following reasons:  The basis for this determination is that the U.S. EPA  Officer of Water previously  awarded a contract, PO 4W-1799-NAEX to Dr. Gerba.  Dr. Gerba reviewed the scoring criteria report, table and microbe list and made recommendations of any gaps and identified any potential or emerging pathogens,  therefore, he is familiar and knowledgeable with the Office of Waters needs.  This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requiring by submitting documentation, to Thomas Martinez at the office identified above, by fax (703)308-2358 or by e-mail  (Thomas.Martinez@epa.gov) , which establishes that their specifications meet EPA?s requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS code 541990:     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Chuck Gerba of the University of Arizona. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.  EPA is developing a new classification process for the selection of a new Contaminant Candidate List as required under the 1996 amended SDWA. This new process was recommended by the  National Research Council  and was recently evaluated by National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC). An EPA CCL microbiology workgroup has been working through the development of a scoring process for 5 microbial attributes (Severity, potency, prevalence, magnitude, persistence-mobility), for  36 microorganisms on the  Preliminary CCL list. A lack of current data has hampered the completion of the  scoring process as shown by inconsistent results stemming from old data.  OST has been able to obtain occurrence summaries on 36 microbes. There is an urgent need to acquire more data on the health effects of E. coli  0157-H7. Which was one of the microbes on the CCL 36 microbe list completed recently by Dr. Charles Gerba.  This need will be fulfilled by an expert microbiologist who is knowledgeable in the old EPA CCL list and the NRC new approach and who completed the occurrence summaries for EPA recently.  Dr.  Gerba reviewed the scoring criteria report, table and microbe list and made recommendations of any gaps and identified any potential or emerging pathogens,  therefore, he is familiar and knowledgeable with the Office of Waters needs.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requiring by submitting documentation, to Thomas Martinez at the office identified above, by fax (703)308-2358 or by e-mail (Thomas.Martinez@epa.gov) , which establishes that their specifications  meet EPA?s requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER:  BAA # 06-07-IFKA

CFDA Number:  12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 19 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Jun 06; and FY 08 by 1 Jun 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 07, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The objective of the Commander's Predictive Environment (CPE) program is to provide a decision support environment that enables the Joint Force Commander / Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFC/JFACC) to anticipate and shape the future battlespace.  As envisioned, CPE will have four key capabilities: 1) Understand the Battlespace, 2) Anticipate Plausible Futures, 3) Evaluate Courses of Action, and 4) Access and Share Battlespace Information.  This BAA specifically addresses the first key capability, "Understand the Battlespace."

To assist in understanding the battlespace, a System-of-Systems Analysis (SoSA) views the battlespace as an interrelated system of Political, Military, Economic, Social, Information, and Infrastructure (PMESII) dimensions.  The process attempts to 1) Model and analyze adversaries, self, and neutrals as a complex adaptive system; 2) Understand key relationships, dependencies, and vulnerabilities of adversary/self/neutrals; and 3) Identify leverage points that represent opportunities to influence capabilities, perceptions, decision making, and behavior.

PMESII model development is currently a time-consuming activity.  Skilled analysts build detailed, narrowly focused models that typically serve a single purpose.  While useful, the current process is too slow, doesn't readily adapt to changes, and does not encompass the entire battlespace.  The future operational need is for a capability that enables rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance.  Significant effort has been undertaken to develop individual PMESII models.  This BAA focuses on technologies for rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance; rather than individual PMESII model development.  The scope of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate technologies to: 1) Facilitate PMESII model development, adaptation, and maintenance, 2) Integrate and/or make interoperable heterogeneous PMESII models, and 3) Leverage proven software engineering concepts such as standards, APIs, interfaces, etc.

Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for developing innovative and critical technologies necessary to make the CPE capability viable. The vision of this research is a "PMESII Model Framework and Development Environment" that is analogous to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for software development. Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches, as well as applied research capabilities, will be sought. The goal of this effort will be to develop technologies that support an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for PMESII model development and maintenance.  Such technologies  include editors/browsers/inspectors, debuggers, version control, hierarchy diagrams, visual development, common model APIs and interfaces, interoperable data and model schema (ontologies), knowledge elicitation, model producer and consumer GUIs, and model reuse. The IDE should be capable of handling heterogeneous modeling frameworks while preserving their underlying formalisms.  For example Markov Decision Process might be connected to an Adaptive Neural Net.  The logic associated with each should be preserved. Also to be addressed  are model scalability, dynamically multi-resolution models and resolution requirements, model abstraction techniques, model validation and verification, mapping of PMESII attributes to Diplomatic Infrastructure Military and Economic (DIME) actions and the predictive capability of the models, dynamic update of schema data/trends and learning/updating relationships amongst attributes.  Solutions are also sought for interoperability between "soft social" and "hard infrastructure" models. All modeling techniques and technologies are of interest (e.g. System dynamics, Fuzzy Network, Associative Memories, Topic Trees, etc.). This BAA places a particular interest in new and innovative approaches for PMESII element modeling and interactions.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $2M; FY 07 - $2.4M; and FY 08 - $500K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts ranging between $50,000 and $300,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All potential applicants are eligible.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 06-07-IFKA.

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:  Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.

All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: 1) Effectiveness in enhancing rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance of PMESII models for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness.  Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4.  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>CFT Industry Day was held on 21 Nov 2005.  Although questions were received and answered during the Industry Day, those still wishing to submit questions may do so in writing only no later than 23 Nov 2005, 12:00 p.m. CST.  All questions submitted in writing by the time stated will be addressed by 5:00 p.m. CST 23 Nov 2005.  All charts from the event are available on the FBO website.  Responses to the questions asked during the Industry Day are as follows:

1.	As indicated on slide 25, teaming possibilities exist or may exist with this RFP.  How does the government anticipate that the solicitation will be structured for subcontractor labor categories?  Will they be ODCs or straight labor categories?

After performing market research, if teaming appears to be a viable option, the decision as to how the labor categories will be structured will be made at that time.

2.	Will the large businesses for this solicitation have small business goals?  If so, what are the anticipated goals?

Yes, the large businesses will more than likely have small business subcontracting goals.  The actual percentages will be determined at a later date.

3.	Will the slides be available on the web and where?

Yes – all public information pertaining to this requirement will be posted to FBO: http://www.fbo.gov/

4.	How will over and above items (property/services/etc) be priced?

We anticipate utilizing a Time and Materials contract.  Over and Above is not typically part of a Time and Materials contract; however, we will also be including firm fixed price provisions.  In the past, firm fixed price provisions have been included but were rarely, if ever, used.  If a firm fixed price CLIN is utilized and Over and Above is necessary, the contractors billing rate plus material will be used for all Over and Above work.
  
5.	What happens to a small business contract when the small business is bought by a large business?  Cancelled?  Novation?

If awarded under a small business set-aside, the small business would lose its status as a small business and would no longer be a contractor for CFT.  However, if award is made to a small business under full and open competition, a novation agreement would be processed and the now large business would continue to perform.

6.	Test stands – Does this reference both components & accessory stands as well as hardware to hang engines in depot as well as intermediate maintenance engine test facilities.

All equipment required for the CFT contract employee to perform his or her job should be provided as part of Base Support, with the exception of common hand tools and personal safety equipment (safety glasses, steel-toed boots, etc.)

7.	Hush Houses – Is this maintenance of structure or interconnecting kit as well as the management of intermediate support kit to include software.

Currently, we are not performing work on Hush Houses as part of CFT.  Warner-Robbins manages this workload and is not using CFT to perform this workload.  However, if we did have a requirement including Hush Houses, the contractor would be responsible only for the maintenance of the portion of the structure that was needed to maintain the noise suppressing effect.  Software maintenance would not be included.

8.	Tell us more about what you envision when you say you will utilize performance based contracting methods.  Does this mean additional award fees & payments for exemplary performance?

The PCO office envisions that a broad performance work statement will be provided with the basic contract, but the majority of the performance-based criteria will be included with each task order.  Although award fees or incentive payments are not anticipated, the PCO office is considering the use of a “bonus point” to be used in the task order selection process for successful performance for follow-on work.

9.	Are the selection criteria listed on slide 21 in any particular order of significance or weight?

No, the slide does not list the factors is any particular order of significance; however, the new CFT regulation: AFMCI21-141, paragraph 3.1.2.3, does list the factors in descending order of importance.

10.	Does a labor category that is newly established on a delivery order terminate at the conclusion of the delivery order?   Or be in effect until the end of the contract?

The labor category would terminate with the completion of the task order.

11.	Who will have oversight for performance-base criteria with decentralized ordering?

The PCO office (Tinker AFB) will have this oversight (Tinker performs the task order selection even for those sites with decentralized ordering.)

12.	Will teaming be authorized?

If, after conducting market research, teaming appears to be a viable option, it will be authorized.

13.	Will there be transition plans for follow-on task orders?

Yes, the contractors will provide these transition plans as part of their response to the RFP.

14.	How do you source select task order proposals when a response is required in 24-48 hours? 

The selection is made without any further information or proposal from the contractor.  The 24-48 hour constraint is referring to the timeframe in which the actual maintainer must be on-site to perform work.

15.	Will we be able to discount rates based on geographic locations?

The contract will utilize a Nationwide Wage Determination that will be applicable to all but Hawaii, Alaska, Pax River, MD; and OCONUS locations.  Hawaii, Alaska, and Pax River, MD operate with local wage determinations.  Rates for OCONUS locations are individually negotiated with the ACO.  No other “discount” rates are currently being considered.

16.	Are you currently looking at a direct award to any 8a companies?  Will there be 2 or more awards to small business?

The PCO office is currently conducting market research to determine the best acquisition strategy in regard to small businesses.  The capabilities documents requested by 30 Nov 2005 will help determine the capabilities small business has to offer CFT. 

17.	Will there be an ombudsman office available to small businesses?  If so, would this service have the capability of assisting small business with invoice payment delays?

Yes, AFFARS 5301.9103 requires an Ombudsman for all contracts.  However, the Ombudsman typically doesn’t assist with payment delays.  In any event, the PCO office will be willing to assist as much as possible; however, payment delays do occasionally occur.

18.	In the out years of this contract, i.e. year 2-10, will prevailing wage determination dictate rate base?

Yes.

19.	Will the draft RFP include sections L&M?

Yes, the draft RFP should include any documents you would typically see with a formal RFP.
20.	What is the role that intermediate-sized businesses will play in the CFT source selection process?

The government only recognizes two types of businesses: small and large.  However, some businesses do consider themselves to be “intermediate-sized.”  Regardless of size, any business that is capable of performing is encouraged to propose.  A large business may also consider teaming possibilities.  All potential offerors are encouraged to attend the next Industry Day tentatively scheduled for 13 Feb 2006 for more information. 

21.	Subcontracting was not allowed under the current contract.  Will it be allowed under the new contract?

Subcontracting is not prohibited on the current contract; however, no small business goals or separate billing rate is included for subcontracting.  Small business subcontracting goals are anticipated for the upcoming contract.   

22.	Answers to questions won’t be posted until later in the week, and the response is due back the 30th.  This is too fast to provide a thoughtful response.  Please extend until 07 Dec 05.

Unfortunately, the timeline cannot be extended.  Please provide the best response possible considering the circumstances.

23.	What is the mix between O level and depot level maintenance?

CFT work is predominantly field-level maintenance.  Very little depot maintenance is performed under CFT.

24.	# of Task Orders on the CFT/Average over the # of years

Between all three ALCs, approximately 85 task orders are issued per year.  

25.	What is the normal term of a Task Order?

Approximately 90% of the task orders have a 12 month period of performance.  After that, 24 months is the most common task order length.

26.	Is there an equal split of Task Orders between primes?

No, although under the current contract, manning is reviewed to ensure level-loading as much as possible.  The new contract will be bound by the 5352.216-9000, Awarding Orders Under Multiple Award Contracts (often referred to as the Fair Opportunity Clause), which states, “…multiple award contractors will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order.” 

27.	Will the current tasking be picked up in the new contract?

No work on the current contract is guaranteed to continue on the upcoming contract.  
 
28.	Will overseas operations require VISA to visit country or will they be covered under SOFA.

VISAs may be required in some locations.
 
29.	Hazard Areas training provided by the government?

Yes, if required to perform work this would be provided under Base Support Clause 5352.245-9000.

30.	You mentioned Joint Logistics Command endorsement.  Will this contract seek to renew that with new/update of current document and communication?  (It’s dated)

Yes, the PCO will seek to renew this endorsement.

31.	Please expand to define “over-the-shoulder” and “OJT” scope as related to non-formal training.

Over-the-shoulder is much like it sounds – as the contractor works, a government employee may watch over his or her shoulder to see what is being done.  What is not anticipated is classroom training or any training involving certification.
 
32.	Are 100% of the OCONUS work force under CFT expats?  Or are foreign nationals employed by some of the contractors?

Currently, no foreign nationals are employed under CFT.  However, this is being reviewed for incorporation into the new contract.  A decision will be made concurrent with the release of the draft RFP.

33.	Will costs incurred to handle recurring requirements such as getting passports and immunizations and keeping them current be allowable on the CFT contract? 

No, these costs should be covered in a contractor’s overheads.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This RFQ has been cancelled effective 11/22/05.  An RFQ  with new specifications will be issued for this requirement in the future. Amendment #3 This requirement is estimated to exceed $175,000, therefore the Trade Agreements Clause 52.225-5 should be included  instead of the Buy American Act-Supplies Clause 52.225-1, in the clause section of this RFQ. Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  In point number 14 of RFQ-OH-06-00007, does the specification require analysis of intact proteins (molecular weight assignment), identification from protein  digests, or both? Additionally, is it acceptable to submit a quote with the option for a second computer? Answer: The EPA will be looking at whole proteins and comparative analysis of different proteins after chemical treatment. This will not require sequencing subroutines, the EPA is looking at  results at a rather bulk macroscale level, rather than elucidating molecular structures of individual molecules.  The EPA's requirement requires the ability to do comparative analysis of chromatographs and mass spectra between samples. An offeror can submit an option for second computer in its  quote, but the EPA budget constraints will determine the purchase of any optional items.   Amendment #1 Technical Questions  Question #1: Requirement:  "Software for performing metabonomics analysis of data."  Please detail the type of data analysis/data reduction desired in terms of Metabonomics  analysis of data.  Metabolomics is quite a large area of study.   EPA Answer:  The EPA requires Metabolite software to conduct comparative analysis between samples, independent of sample size.   Question #2:  Requirement:  "Combined Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric pressure chemical  ionization (APCI) ion source".   Is this to say that the EPA does not need or want dedicated ESI or APCI sources in the instrument proposal.  The dual ESI/APCI sources are not as sensitive as the dedicated ion sources.  EPA Answer:  The EPA will accept alternate quotes for separate ESI and APCI  sources, but it is expected that quotes include the cost breakdown for the option between combined sources and separate sources.  In addition, the contractor shall provide technical documentation in support of each of the proposed approaches. The last day for technical questions is Thursday  October 27, 2005 by 3:00PM (EST). Quadrapole/Time of Flight (Q-TOF) Tandem Mass Spectrometer    This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334516.

<DESC>All questions were copied verbatim.  No changes were made to spelling errors, grammatical mistakes or punctuation oversights.

 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION #06-CS-SKI-01


1.  How many resources are needed?

One full-time position is required.

2.  Is there a page limit on either the technical or business section?

No

3.  You reference M.2., however, on page 45 there’s only section M.1 which talks about the evaluation factors and then it jumps to M.3

The reference to M.2. on Page 43 should read M.1.  For purposes of this solicitation, there is no M.2.


4.  INDUS Technology Inc. Is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business whose core competencies include Systems Engineering, IT, Acquisition Support, Program Management, and Budgeting/Financial services, and is very interested in bidding on this opportunity.  However, our last three years of annualized revenue is approximately $10 Million, which prevents us from bidding on the $6 Million NAICS code of 541611.  Would the government consider revising the NAICS code for this procurement to include other well-qualified bidders that happen to be slightly larger than the existing revenue requirement?

No.  The NAICS code of 541611 remains in place for this requirement.	

5.  Is there an incumbent?

Yes, Conner Consulting & Resources
6.  What is the GS Equivalent Grade/Step Level of the position?

The Contractor shall propose this position commensurate with the duties listed in the solictation.

7.  Is electronic delivery of proposals acceptable?

No.

8.  Your cost proposal instructions are explicit.  It is our understanding that you would like our Direct Labor (DL) rate, Overhead Rate (OH), Fringe Rate, G&A Rate and Fee.  Can you clarify as to if you want each specific rate broken down, i.e.: do you want us to break down our OH and G&A to show office expenses, OH personnel, Program Management Staff, Administrative Staff, etc...?

We require proper supporting documentation (previously negotiated indirect rates with another Government agency, payroll documentation etc) to support your proposed rates.

9.  Is there an incumbent individual or firm performing this task?

Yes, see Question Number 5.


10.  The cover letter states that this opportunity will be awarded under NAICS Code 541611 but the text on page 42, Section L. 1 states that it will be awarded under NAICS Code 541990.  Please clarify.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 541611


11.  Page 19, Section I.1 of the proposal states that the total duration of the contract including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 4 years, shouldn’t this be a total of 5 years or 60 months since it is a bse year and 4 one year options.

It is anticipated that this shall be a base year PLUS four options years - 60 months in total.


12.  The representations and certifications provided in the RFQ are almost the same as those in the OCRA which we have printed for the proposal (as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations).  Do you wish that both items be provided in the proposal submission?  Please clarify.

ORCA submission of Reps and Certs  is applicable to this solicitation.


13.  Since the entire solicitation was PDF’d before being posted on FEDBIZOPS may we use the updated (3/2005 version) of the SF-1449 that is posted to the GSA forms website for our submission?

Yes



14.  Proposal submission Date: Considering the FAR guidance regarding adequate time for the submission of proposals besides the need to maximize competition, why is only about a week being allowed for the submission of proposals?

In accordance with FAR 5.203 (a) “...the contracting officer may (1) Establish a shorter period for issuance of the solicitation; or (2) Use the combined synopsis and solicitation procedure (see 12.603).


15.  C.3.  Statement of Work: Considering the very restrictive nature (only Service Disabled Veteran Owned SBS) of the set-aside coupled with the SOW requirement that the contractor shall have an extensive knowledge if HHS Acquisition regulations and procurement systems, such a later requirement severly restricts most SBVOs from qualifying.  Furthermore, such a combined requirement may result in a de-factor sole-source situation as contemplated in the initial synopsis.  Since FAR provides extensive (1600 pages) of contracting policy and procedures which all Government Department and Agencies supplement to some degree, HHS internal procurement policies and procedures should not be so controlling.  In order to maximize or, at least, achieve adequate competition, it is requested that the competitive restrictive HHS acquisition requirement be deleted since proposed Government contracting personnel would have the overall expertise to accomplish any Government Department or Agency supplimental acquisition procedure.

All references to having experience relative to HHS contracting shall be deleted from this solicitation.

Page 4, C.3 - Delete last sentence, paragraph two  and replace with the following sentence: “The Contractor shall have extensive knowledge of Federal Acquisition Regulations”.




16.  C3.1.3 Qualifications - Last Paragraph: This qualification refers to unique HHS processing experience.  This is the same type of restrictive language as mentioned above.  In order to achieve some competition, request that this requirement be deleted.

Last paragraph of C 3.1.3 is deleted in its entirety.	

17.  Is there an incumbent for this engagement?

Yes, see Question #5

18.  Who is it please:

Conner Consulting & Resources

19.  How many contracted personnel do you currently have on the job performing what this contract requires and will that number increase?

One; No

20.  If the incumbent is not selected, would it be reasonable to try and hire some if the current personnel, provided you are pleased with their current performance?

Question not clear - unable to answer.

21.  Is teaming allowed as long as the 51% performed by the prime is intact (I am assuming this is a requirement)?

Question not clear - unable to answer.

22.  As regards the pricing sheet, do you want the price for 1 year for 1 individual over the base and 4 option years?

Yes

23.  Is there an URL where the answers will be posted?

FEDBIZOPPS


24.  Ms. Kelly, my name is Mike Davis and I am preparing a formal bid for RFQ 06-CS-SKI-01, “Acquisition Management Augmentation Support Services”.  I have a question reference Schedule B.  Are we to assume that there is only one labor category that is required to accomplish task, i.e., Contract Level I and, or Contract Level II?  Or if there is more than one labor category we recommend in our proposal to execute the job, do we list the labor categories in the Schedule B?  Do we also outline the number of persons/labor categories to execute the jobs in Schedule B and Business Proposal?


There is only one position to be offered for this solicitation - see Question #1.

THE DUE DATE REMAINS THE SAME FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking qualified businesses that can provide preservation maintenance services on board the USCG MACKINAW (WLBB).  At this time we are also considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.    The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The homeport of the vessel is 627 COAST GUARD DRIVE, CHEBOYGAN, MICHIGAN. The Contractor shall be aware that all contractors and subcontractors who perform surface preparation and coating application on “critical-coated surfaces”,shall be certified by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) to the requirements of SSPC QP 1 prior to contract award, and shall remain certified while accomplishing any surface preparation or coating application.  The painting contractors and painting subcontractors must remain so certified for the duration of the project.  If the contractor's or subcontractor's certification expires, the contractor will not be allowed to perform any work until the certification has been reissued.  NOTICE! Information on the SSPC certification programs can be found at www.sspc.org
If you are a qualified business that is interested in performing these services, please notify our office of your intent.  Also this synopsis will also service to see if there are any qualified HUBZONE or SERVICE DISABLED VENTERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS.   In accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to smartinez@mlca.uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking market research, potential sources, and best practice information towards designing, developing, and buying a replacement item to provide torso ballistic protection with integrated and scalable load-carrying capabilities for individual Marines.  The OTV, along with ballistic protective inserts, is commonly known as the USMC’s very successful “Interceptor” system.  The currently used Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) portion was developed in the late 1990’s.  It consists of soft armor (i.e., fragmentation protection) covering the torso, groin and neck and can carry ceramic plates to protect against rifle fire.  The OTV, however, is not designed – but is being used for – carrying equipment and items during USMC missions.  Consequently, the OTV lacks efficient state-of-the-art load carrying capabilities and technologies that limit the user’s effectiveness.   The OTV needs to be redesigned to carry a Marine’s assault load (i.e. magazines, water, grenades, etc.).  It is to use state of the art load carriage techniques to optimally distribute the load over the torso.  The contemplated integrated OTV will combine the capabilities to carry the ballistic protection and combat load.  The system will use the current Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) plates.  Due the availability of and monetary investment in soft armor, the USMC anticipates the need to also use the soft armor currently in the OTV.  The USMC envisions at this time a modular/scaleable integrated OTV system,  that will enable individual Marines to configure components to best meet specific mission requirements optimizing/balance human factors (e.g. comfort and usability), protection (from enemy threats and environment) and cost (production and maintenance).  For example, an infantry Marine may configure the integrated OTV for jungle operations by removing all the ballis!  tic components and limiting the ammunition carried; alternatively, a Marine may configure the integrated OTV for urban fighting by adding all the ballistic protection and an increased ammunition load out.  Berry Amendment will apply to the future procurement.  In designing/developing the integrated OTV, companies are expected to apply best practice human-factors, casualty reduction analysis and business analysis to meet the needs of Marines.   The USMC is currently performing market research to learn applicable/proven best practices (note the integrated OTV requirements are not yet complete and a formal solicitation has not yet been developed).  Within that effort, the USMC wants to leverage its expertise in USMC operational/capability needs and related constraints with industries’ established expertise and capabilities to design, develop, produce, and support best value products.  Therefore, the USMC is taking the following market research steps:  First, the USMC is requesting from interested companies, information on best approaches to satisfy the above needs.  Furnished written materials and any proprietary information will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.  Also, please provide company size.  These responses should be received not later than January 15, 2006 by sending it to Jennifer Breder, at email address jennifer.breder@usmc.mil or via FEDEX/UPS deliveries to Command, Jennifer Breder, CT!  Q3JB, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street Quantico VA 22134-6050.  Any/all questions regarding submission of materials should be addressed to Jennifer Breder at 703-432-3266.  Second, to help industry best understand the USMC performance capability needs, the USMC will host an OTV Integration Industry Conference to be held at the Hilton Old Town Alexandria on 1767 King Street on December 20th, 2005 starting at 0900.  The session will provide an overview of current issues, uses, capability needs, constraints, and provide other information and answers to written questions or concerns received before the conference date.  The USMC is eager to hear industry best-practice ideas used in other/similar projects (commercial and federal).  In recognition of probable proprietary concerns, a limited number of individual sessions can be arranged with the acquisition team to discuss company-specific ideas and concerns.  Such one-on-one sessions will not exceed one hour each and should inclu!  de company qualifications and best practice ideas towards creating a s uccessfully integrated OTV.  Due to resource demands, time is limited.  Companies wishing to attend the conference or meet on a one-on-one basis should register by no later than 14 DECEMBER 2005 by emailing Jennifer Breder at jennifer.breder@usmc.mil.  Session requests should include company capabilities/similar-relevant past performance information and limit participation to three people.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command Program Manager for Assault Amphibious Vehicle Systems is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey in accordance with FAR Part 10. This notice neither constitutes an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. The PM AAVS is looking for sources that can address the needs of the Marine Corps to provide a requirement for a replacement day night sight system for the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV7A1) Up Gunned Weapons Station (UGWS) M36E3 sight. The current system employs image intensifier technology that amplifies existing light. The current range of detection is limited to less then 1000 meters and this technology does not provide the ability to see through smoke, fog, sand or other obscurants to visible light. The new AAV7A1 day night sight must provide both daylight and night sighting ability to detect targets to 4700 meters, recognize targets to !  2500 meters and identify targets at 700 meters and be a replacement for or a modification to the M36E3. As with the current M36E3 system a separate day optical sight will be collocated with the new thermal sight system. The thermal sight system shall provide sighting for both the MK19 and M-2 machine guns. Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sought shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as such.

<DESC>Spiral Developments for the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) - The Air Armament Center, Air-to-Air Missile Wing, Aerial Targets Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL. AFSATs are being procured under a competitively awarded contract with Composite Engineering, Inc., using full and open competition procedures.   AAC/SASG/RT plans to contract for development efforts to enhance the performance of the AFSAT to meet operational performance objectives not attainable in the baseline target configuration.  The first spiral anticipated by the Government includes the design, integration, and test of radar cross section (RCS) augmentation devices into the target system to make it more threat representative.   The Air Force contracted for a radar augmentation study to assess the augmentation options and the study verified that the RCS requirements might be met in a cost effective manner using a passive system.  An unclassified version of this study is available upon request.  This task would require access to and generation of information up to the security classification of SECRET.  Also included in this spiral is a developmental effort to internalize the DLQ-9 Electronic Attack Pod electronic components within the AFSAT.  For this effort the contractor, with program office arranged support from the EA component designers at NAVAIR Airborne Threat Simulation Organization (ATSO), Point Mugu, California, is required to integrate, the external pod mounted DLQ-9 EA electronic components internal to the AFSAT airframe and to test this internal mounted design to verify successful carriage and operation.   Also included in this spiral is the incorporation of several aerodynamic improvement efforts.  These improvements include: a) changing the sweep angle of the stabilator training edge, b) modifying the type and placement of bearing used on the stabilator torque tube, c) redesigning the process and material used to cap the tips of the stabilator, d) modifying or eliminating the engine thrust ejector, e) redesigning and implementing a change to decrease the gap between the rudder and vertical stabilizer, f) developing and providing aileron actuator arm enclosures, g) providing inset pockets to recess the radar altimeter antennas, h) providing and testing alternative flush mounted TM antennas, i) redesigning the bottom empennage such that the heat shield is recessed or flush with the outer mold line.  Product improvements under this spiral development are required to be developed and verified in time to be incorporated into AFSAT Production Lot 4, which is scheduled for delivery beginning in February 2008.  The second spiral development effort planned by the Government includes AFSAT hardware and software design, integration, and test activities required to provide the capability to simultaneously operate ALE-47 Chaff and DLQ-9 Electronic Attack (EA) Pods during AFSAT flight operations.  It is anticipated that this effort may require configuration changes to both the AFSAT unique Target Test Set, as well as the AFSAT, hardware and software.  In addition under this spiral development the contractor will also be required to design, develop, integrate and test a new dual function pod that will provide the functionality of both the current APC-4 Infrared Radiation Pod and the RCS augmentation devices developed under the RCS augmentation effort included in the first AFSAT spiral development.  Product improvements under Spiral 2 are required for Production Lot 5, which is scheduled for delivery beginning in February 2009.   The third spiral currently planned by the Government includes design, integration, and test of engine, airframe, and avionics software enhancements that would be required for the AFSAT to achieve low supersonic flight.  Product improvements under Spiral 3 are required for Production Lot 8, which is scheduled for delivery beginning in February 2012.  A Government-owned technical data package of the baseline AFSAT design does not exist to provide interested parties for use in these development efforts.  The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to meet the requirements of these three development efforts within the required schedule.   Responses are required NLT 22 Dec 05.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort. See Numbered Notes 25 and 26.

<DESC>NOTE: The text that follows is intended to replace the entire notice and its modification published November 16 and 18, 2005. This notice is accompanied by three (3) attachments, all under the above Reference Number.

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.  
	
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT:  The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP.  

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized contract work will be paid at the above weekly/daily/hourly rates. There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. 3) The IC contract will include reimbursement for the required medical evacuation coverage, not to exceed $500.00, and medical examination costs up to $500.00. 4) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. 
	
NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are NOT authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Interested individuals are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR which is available at FedBizOpps under the above Reference Number. 

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at  http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf . A copy of the current version (2002) available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBP.IC@dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied previously are to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and awarded a contract for one or more assignments in the future. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00).

CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at  http://www.acqnet.gov/far/ ).

NOTE: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at  www.ccr.gov  prior to issuance of a contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number.

Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept the contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor.  

NOTE: This announcement is not an offer of employment. This Notice is being published on an annual basis and supersedes previous notices for intermittent contractors issued by CBP. This Notice remains in affect until canceled or superseded. Applicants must realize that CBP requirements for the services described above occur on a sporadic basis and there is no assurance or guarantee that they will receive a contract for the services described herein.

Request For Interest (RFI)

Naval Facilities Engineering Command
Washington
1314 Harwood Street, SE, Building 212, Washington Navy Yard, DC  20374
Attn:  Code RES

This Request for Interest (RFI) is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of Government requirements and assess market capabilities and interest.  Before committing to award a lease, the Government wants to obtain information from potentially interested parties concerning rental consideration, other market information, and to identify potential re-use opportunities for Government-owned property that is not excess to the needs of the Department of Defense (DoD), but is not fully utilized.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, but will be used by the Government in making decisions about subsequent issuance of a Request For Proposals (RFP) that would solicit such offers.    

The Department of the Navy has the authority to outlease approximately 857 acres of government-owned land along with improvements and personal property thereon, using competitive procedures.  The property is located approximately 15 miles northwest of the United States Naval Academy in Anne Arundel County, Gambrills, Maryland.  It is locally known and hereinafter referred to as the “Dairy Farm”.  A site map is attached as Exhibit A.

The proposed outlease of the property would not include any livestock or any agricultural equipment such as tractors, trucks, combines, wagons, etc.  A building/facility inventory would be included in the RFP.  Currently, there are approximately 165 acres available for pasturing and 520 acres available for crop production.  There are approximately 26 acres of improvements, and approximately 146 acres are woodlands, riparian buffers, archeological sites, which cannot be disturbed, and set-asides for wildlife, which must be maintained in grass cover.

Information and/or documents pertaining to this property and provided to interested parties is believed to be correct; however, the Government does not warrant this information.  The property would be offered for lease on an “as-is-where-is” basis, without warranty.

The Lease requirements will include the following:

(a)  The Government shall have the right to terminate the lease in whole or part, at any time, without prior notice and without liability regardless of any lack of breach by Lessee of any of the terms and conditions of the Lease.  In the event of a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, the Government may terminate the Lease immediately, without notice to Lessee.  

The Lessee shall have the right to terminate the Lease upon 180 days written notice at any time.  Upon termination or expiration of the Lease, it will be the Government’s option to cause title to all improvements to be vested in the United States of America at no cost to the Government, or to require the Lessee to remove the improvements and restore the premises to its original condition at no cost to the Government.

(b)	Use of the Leased Premises.  Rural/Agricultural, as required by 10 USC § 6976.  Current County zoning of the property is also rural/agricultural.  

(c)	Rent.  Navy will seek not less than fair market rent as determined by an appraisal.  Rent consideration shall be in the form of cash to be remitted monthly/quarterly/semi-annually/annually, in advance, over the term of the Lease.  

Amount of rent consideration for the first five (5) years of the Lease will be based on the offered/negotiated rental as a result of the RFP.  Rent consideration for each succeeding five (5) year period shall be adjusted based upon the Government’s fair market rental value appraisal, or any revisions thereto as required, for the leased premises.

(d)	Assignment or Subletting:  Lessee may not transfer or assign the lease or any interest therein nor sublet or otherwise make available to any third party or parties any portion of the premises or rights therein without the prior written consent of the Government.

(e)	Hazardous Materials:  Lessee shall comply with all applicable State, Federal and Local regulations concerning the storing, use, and disposal of hazardous materials.

(f)	Restrictions/Environmental Condition:  Land-use restrictions are required to be put into place to limit access to two areas along the western boundary of the farm, as generally depicted on Exhibit A.  These two areas were historically used to dispose of farm waste.  If the property is outleased, the Navy will include land-use restrictions in the lease to limit access to the two areas.  The restrictions will state that grazing in the two areas would not be permitted, and that no further dumping of material in the two areas is authorized.

The land is believed to be free of contamination by toxic or hazardous substances, contains no wetlands, and is otherwise suitable for farming.  The Government will provide information about environmental conditions as part of any leasing RFP.

(g)	Possessory Interest Tax:  The leasehold interest in Government-owned land may be subject to state and local taxation as a possessory interest in tax exempt real property.  The amount of assessment charged the Lessee is determined by the County Assessor.  Such taxes are the sole responsibility and liability of the Lessee.

(h) Insurance Requirements:  The Lessee will be required to carry general liability insurance and Fire and Extended Coverage on the leased premises in the amount and type specified by the Government for the term of the lease.  Each policy of insurance shall name both Lessee and the United States of America (Department of the Navy) as the insured.

(i)	General Maintenance:  The Lessee, at its own expense, shall be responsible for the day-to-day protection, preservation, and general maintenance of the leased premises (including vacant and/or unutilized facilities).  The Lessee will at all times keep the leased premises in at least as good condition as when received whether Lessee utilizes the entire leased premises or not.

(j)  Soil and Water Conservation Plan:  A Soil and Water Conservation Plan (SWCP) will be prepared and included in the RFP, which will subsequently become a part of the lease agreement.  A SWCP specifies the best use for each area based on soil type and topography.  A SWCP lists acceptable crop rotations, erosion prevention methods, pest management methods, grazing capacity, and other items necessary to ensure long-term sustainability of the Dairy Farm.

(k)  Natural Resources Management Plan:  A Natural Resources Management Plan (NRMP) is a long-term planning document to guide the management of natural resources.  The primary purpose of the NRMP is to ensure that natural resources conservation measures undertaken on the Farm are consistent with stewardship obligations and legal requirements.  A NRMP for the Dairy Farm is under development.  Lessee would be required to follow the plan.  Projects outlined in the plan will be implemented by the Navy’s Natural Resources Program.

(l)	Permits:  Lessee will be responsible for obtaining any and all local, county, state, or federal permits that may be required by law in connection with the use of the leased premises.

(m)	Historic Preservation:  The Dairy Farm has been determined to be a historic district eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  Its contributing architectural resources include 30 buildings (out of 70) as well as the cemetery of the Hammond Manor House, which was destroyed by fire in the 1970’s.  A listing of these resources will be provided as an attachment to the RFP.  Any Lessee of the property would have to receive approval from the Navy before undertaking any repair, demolition, maintenance or modifications to historic buildings. 

(n)	Legislative Jurisdiction:  The Federal Government exercises “exclusive” legislative jurisdiction over the lands of the Dairy Farm, which means that any criminal activity occurring at the Farm would have to be handled by the Federal Government.  The State (or local police) would not have any authority to arrest, prosecute, etc. any criminal activity occurring at the Farm.  The Government intends to request a retrocession of legislative jurisdiction to “concurrent”, which means either the Federal or State may take action involving criminal activity. 

(o)	Utilities:

Water:  The Dairy Farm has its own wells and potable water treatment and distribution system.  The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) classified this system as a “community water system”.  As a community water system, regular testing and reporting is required.  Lessee shall be responsible for coordinating and obtaining all permits, reports, and testing associated with this system, and paying all required fees.

Sanitary Sewer System:  A sanitary sewer system services the property.  The sanitary sewer system collects waste at a pumping station where it is pumped to a county system.  Anne Arundel County bills quarterly for this service and also charges an annual “front footage” assessment.  Additionally, the system is operated under a Wastewater Discharge Permit issued by Anne Arundel County.  There is an annual administrative fee for this permit.  Lessee shall be responsible for these charges.

Electricity:  Electricity for the Dairy Farm is provided by Baltimore Gas and Electric (BG&E) under 13 separate accounts.  One bill is for the operational side of the farm and the remaining 12 are for individual houses and mobile homes.  Lessee shall be responsible for transferring these accounts into its name.  Lessee shall be responsible for these charges.
 
(p)	Other:

Boilers:  There are two (2) 55 horsepower, oil-fired, steam boilers.  The boilers are registered with the State of Maryland and Anne Arundel County.  The boilers require inspection annually by a certified boiler inspector.  Annual inspections and the fee(s) will be the responsibility of the Lessee.

Refuse and Trash Removal:  The Lessee shall be responsible for all trash and refuse removal.

(q)	Goats:  Lessee will be required to provide, at no cost to the Government, for the boarding and feeding of the Navy Goats, the Official Mascots of the United States Naval Academy.  The number of goats may vary between one and three.

In accordance with Title 10 of the United States Code, Section 2695, the Government requires compensation for the administrative costs associated with the preparation and execution of this type of real estate contract.  Should the Government decide to proceed with the issuance of an RFP followed by an award of a lease, the successful Offeror/Lessee that is chosen would be responsible to reimburse the Government for the administrative costs at the time of award and prior to execution of a lease.

The Government’s cost estimate for administrative expenses associated with this action is $89,200.  This estimate covers expenses related to in-house and contractor labor, preparation of legal documents, an appraisal to determine the fair market rental value, environmental studies, technical plans, etc.  The administrative costs were estimated to sufficiently cover the costs of the RFI, RFP, and pre-and post award requirements.  However, for any reason should the actual costs expended be more than amount estimated, the Navy reserves the right to require additional funds before a Lease can be executed.  

Additionally, the Government reserves the right, unilaterally, to not issue an RFP or make an award, and cancel this RFI if it deems appropriate, at no cost to the Government.

Interested parties are encouraged to make arrangements to inspect the property.  To do so, please contact Robert Pokoj at 410-293-3168.  Advance arrangements are required.

TRICA RE Management Activity (TMA) is the DoD organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefit.  This includes integrating state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. TMA is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a DoD Telepharmacy solution within the MHS.   Telepharmacy is defined as,  a computer system integrating videoconferencing technology with native pharmacy operations management software located at both a central pharmacy site and a remote telepharmacy site to permit a pharmacist at a central pharmacy to access a patient medicati on profile and perform a prospective drug utilization review by computer on each prescription before it is dispensed to the patient at a remote site.  Central pharmacy site is defined as,  a full service pharmacy staffed by a registered pharmacist with access by computer, audio and video link to a remote site where the patient is located. Remote site is defined as,  a full service pharmacy staffed by a registered pharmacy technician with access by computer, audio and video link to a licensed pharmacist at a central pharmacy site while open. The remote site is analogous to originating site, where the patient is lo cated. Through use of telepharmacy technology, pharmacy services will be provided using the same quality standards used in traditional pharmacy practice including pharmacist prescription verification before dispensing, drug utilization review, and patient educati on counseling while satisfying all board of pharmacy rules and regulations.  Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: Conceptual technical architectures and alternatives for implementing DoD Telepharmacy, including,  ·Technical feasibility  ·Alternatives assessments ·Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to implementing, operating and managing DoD Telepharmacy  4.0 REQUIREMENTS This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for DoD Telepharmacy.   Functional ·DoD Telepharmacy shall provide prescriptio n fill/check/dispense capabilities at a remote site. ·DoD Telepharmacy shall provide access to all pertinent patient information (medication profile, age, sex, weight, etc) at a central pharmacy and remote site.  ·DoD Telepharmacy shall provide full documentation and auditing capabilities of the prescription fill process (fill/check/dispense). ·DoD Telepharmacy shall provide documentation of process (fill/check/dispense) to print patient specific labels. System ·DoD Telepharmacy shall provide commercial-grade VTC communications capabilities within the network among specified users using the data network components and protocols.  There will be no communications or gateways outside of DoD Telepharmacy. ·DoD Telepharmacy shall meet quality standards for VTC to provide access to patient (via video) and shall provide imaging capability (for any hardcopy scripts, tablets in bottle).  ·DoD Telepharmacy shall offer on-demand services at central pharmacy and remote site locations and will be scalable to meet growth in overall network demand and/or peak requirements.  ·DoD Telepharmacy shall have commercial pharmacy management system interface capabilities. The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.   This RFI seeks information about approaches that could meet the functional requirements with additional levels of sharing of personnel, equipment, and connectivity paths.  In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (in itial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increasing degrees of sharing.   The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. 5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION Following is the Point of Contact for this RFI,including the public information exchange meeting:Kelly R.

<SUBJECT>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT - SEABASE TO SHORE CONNECTOR (SSC) FOR CONCEPT STUDIES AND  TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES
<DESC>Subject:  BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT - SEABASE TO SHORE CONNECTOR (SSC) FOR CONCEPT STUDIES AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES Notice Date:  November 22, 2005 Contracting Office:  Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, SEA 02224, Washington, D.C. 20376-0001 Response Due:  December 30, 2005 Point of Contact:  Mr. Thomas J. Murphy, PMS377KB, 202-781-4176  Contracting Officer:  Mr. Chris Sherman, SEA 02224, 202-781-3934, christopher.sherman@navy.mil The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), the Program Executive Officer, Ships (PEO Ships) and the Amphibious Warfare Program Office (PMS377) are seeking information from interested sources toward the development of the Seabase-to-Shore Connector (SSC).  The SSC is the future craft for transporting vehicles and cargo from the seabase to shore.  It is also the planned replacement craft for the current Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC).  The SSC will provide high speed, over the horizon, heavy lift capability to transport the personnel, equipment, and material of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) as established for year 2015.   The SSC is in the early stages of development.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) is being prepared and approval of the document is expected in May 2006.  During FY06, an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) will be conducted and a Systems and Technology Development (STD) effort will be initiated.  A more extensive STD Phase will follow in FY07.  Preliminary and Final Design of the SSC will continue in FY08/09.  Award of a contract for detail design and construction is expected in FY10.  The SSC will have, at a minimum, the ability to operate in the well deck of existing and planned U.S. Navy amphibious ships; operate with Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) and MPF Future (MPF(F)) ships; operate over beaches, ice, mud, and marsh areas; operate in inland regions; ascend a beach gradient of 5 degrees from standstill; ascend a beach gradient of 6 degrees at a minimum approach speed of 5 knots and transport a cargo load of 140,000 pounds. Requirements for the SSC are not finalized.  However, for purpose of this announcement, participants should assume that the SSC must have capability and performance equivalent to or exceeding that of the SLEP LCAC craft.  The SLEP LCAC is an air cushion vehicle with a design payload of 140,000 pounds, deck area of 1809 sq. feet, and a speed of 50 knots at a design weight of 344,685 pounds.  At a minimum, it can operate in loaded conditions in a sea state where significant wave heights do not exceed one foot.  The dimensions of the SLEP LCAC when on cushion are: length, 92 feet; beam, 47.5 feet; and height, 26 feet.  Craft concepts are not limited to air cushion vehicles and alternatives to air cushion vehicles are sought; however, all concepts must satisfy the requirement to cross beaches and marshes and transit some distance inland. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks proposals for concept studies and technology development initiatives in support of the SSC AOA and initial STD Phase.  The general intent is to use a two phased approach.  Phase I will involve the award of contracts to define a proof of concept or describe a technology development initiative, as well as a more detailed plan for further technology development in Phase II.  Where a concept or technology may already be sufficiently mature and provides a significant payoff, consideration may be given to bypassing Phase I and awarding a Phase II contract now.  NAVSEA intends to award up to five (5) contracts for Phase I concept studies with a value up to $200K each.  These contracts will require development of the concept to a point where the feasibility of meeting mission requirements can be assessed.  NAVSEA also intends to award up to 10 Phase I technology development contracts with a value up to $200K each.  The technology developmen!  t efforts chosen will be those deemed most likely to lead to improved capabilities and performance of the SSC, as compared to the SLEP LCAC.  Phase II contracts for additional development of a concept or technology may be made, without further competition, based on the contractor's proposal submitted at the end of Phase I.  In the alternative, Phase II contracts may be awarded now, in response to a proposal to further develop a sufficiently mature technology.  NAVSEA intends to award up to a total of seven (7) Phase II contracts with a value not to exceed $1M each. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION:  Companies shall submit white papers summarizing their proposed SSC concepts and/or technology development effort. The information of interest to the Navy includes, but is not limited to, the following capabilities and performance improvements for the SSC compared to SLEP LCAC:  the ability to operate in higher sea state conditions; increased payload, range and speed; reduced crewing; reduced maintenance and operational costs; and increased reliability and maintainability.  Additionally, the Navy is interested in improvements that increase the ability of the SSC over the SLEP LCAC to cross natural and man-made obstacles; decrease internal and external noise; decrease on/off load times of equipment and fuel; increase Infra-Red (IR) suppression; improve Command, Control, Computers, Communication, and Navigation (C4N) including tactical displays; improve self defense; increase the ability to operate in Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) environment; improve Onboard Training; increase the number of personnel that can be transported internal to the craft; and expansion of the operati!  onal ambient temperature range relative to cargo load.

create revolutionary scientific breakthroughs, enabling the Air Force and U.S. industry to
produce world-class, militarily significant, and commercially valuable products.
In Fiscal Year 2005, AFOSR managed funding support for approximately 1,400 grants,
cooperative agreements, and contracts, totaling $424 million, to about 400 academic institutions
and industrial firms. This included grants to university scientists and academic institutions,

Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for
these programs can also be accessed through AFOSR’s web page at

envision cooperation among two or more partners from academia, industry, and Air Force
organizations. Non-industry proposers should spell out in their proposals their interactions with
industry and Air Force organizations, including specific points of contact. AFOSR also
encourages proposers to cooperate with or use Air Force facilities; proposers should contact
appropriate directorates in the Air Force Research Laboratory for this purpose. This document
will guide proposers through AFOSR's research program and facilitate their preparation of
research proposals.
AFOSR primary contacts’ names, telephone numbers, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses
are provided at the end of each research interest, external program description, and special
program description. If you have general questions about the Proposal Guidance, please

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation for small business set-aside utilizing the associated NAICS code 336611.  Solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clau ses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular.  Offers will be evaluated as far as the total cost to the Government pertaining to the travel time/cost to and from the facility and the repair facilitys offer.  Provision at 52.212-1, Instruct ions to Offerors  Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offerors shall include with their offer a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.  Clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and C onditions  Commercial Items, and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items, are applicable to this acquisition. Scope:  This specification represents the minimum acceptable repairs to be performed to the Motor Vessel WARIOTO (hereafter referred to as towboat) and Deck Barges ND31, ND32 and ND 34.

These time constraints also dictate the geographic area that the v essels may be taken to in order that repairs may be performed.  Travel distance must be limited to 100 river miles from the vessels location near Kentucky Dam, Tennessee River Mile 22.4.  This will enable the vessels to depart and return to their duty sit e without causing fiscal loss to the government.  The towboat weights approximately 450 tons.

Accordingly the square footage areas to be cleaned will not be reduced with the following exceptions.  The following areas will not be required to receive janitorial services, Building A – Room A111, and Building 16, Room 104.  This will reduce the amount of square footage to be cleaned by 228 square feet.  The statement of work will be changed to read: C-7: At no time shall the Contractor and his/her employees be required to handle or dispose of waste designated as Bio-Hazard, or Radiological; or be required to enter any areas designated as High Containment i.e.: BSL level 3 or Higher.
