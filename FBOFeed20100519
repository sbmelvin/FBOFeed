<DESC>This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) describing the research areas of interest for the Soldier Portable Power Management &amp; Distribution program. This effort will evaluate existing soldier portable power management and distribution technology and continue to develop this technology with system goals aimed at demonstrating reduced size and weight, increased reliability, temperature capability, usability, efficiency, and fault tolerance for power conditioning, power management and distribution components and systems. It is expected that the offeror will jointly develop both an advanced power management system as well as the associated low profile power distribution hardware, where appropriate, to effectively and efficiently distribute power with minimal impact to the user. The offeror must be able to demonstrate that a feasible approach exists for improving upon the current state of the art resulting in an electronically controlled system which automatically and safely maintains power to critical soldier-portable devices and facilitates the recharging of batteries in a safe manner from various sources. The contractor will also address manufacturing challenges while meeting MILSPEC standards. By streamlining manufacturing processes and removing highly skilled labor, product cost will reduce and consistency will improve. The joint Power Manager manufacturing challenges include reducing the size of power electronics while maintaining performance and safety, preventing failures from internal faults through improved construction materials, development of "plug and play" architecture and application of joint connectors and communication protocols. The Vest Power manager manufacturing challenges include eliminating interference between internal electronics, integration of joint connectors, and EMI shielding of connectors and electronic components. Low profile cabling manufacturing concerns include ruggedization of power strips and connectors to MILSPECs. The Air Force reserves the right to award one or more contracts if that best suits the Government's needs. The estimated period of performance is 18 months. The Offeror will be expected to produce prototype hardware which meets technical requirements as stated in the full text announcement. The full BAA announcement can be accessed at the following website: http://www.fbo.gov. Technical question will be directed to AFRL/RZPS, Attn: Dr. Thomas Reitz, (937) 255-4275, email: Thomas.Reitz@wpafb.af.mil

<DESC>The Government intends to procure a lease of the receivers in reference to CO2 Receiver Requirements Lease.   The purpose of this effort is to lease storage receivers which shall be capable of completely automatic long-term storage of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) and shall be capable of supplying liquid of gaseous CO2 to other equipment by simply connecting hoses and valves.  The receivers shall be capable of being refilled while in use.  Environmental issues relative to hazardous content of the tanks necessitates proper maintenance and the ability to obtain a rapid response in emergency cases.  Timeliness of maintenance is required in order to prevent or minimize costly test delays associated with temperature conditioning of a test article.  AirGas Carbonic is the only know supplier of the stationary and portable receivers in the southeast area of the United States capable of providing the required receivers and associated service.  Award to another source in another region of the United States would likely result in additional transportation and travel costs, and result in unacceptable delays in maintenance.  AirGas Carbonic Inc., 6340 Sugarload Parkway, Suite 300, Duluth, GA 30097 is the only approved source.  To request a copy of this solicitation please e-mail karen.jean.jones@us.army.mil.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a contract to The University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC), 315 Riverbend Road, Athens, Ga, 30602 for critical, custom designed carbohydrate compounds required to complete experiments for optimization of assay methodology developed at the CDC. The objectives this acquisition will help the CDC achieve are to; a) Increase the sensitive of diagnostic assays for anthrax, b) Assess serological cross-reactivity of anthrax carbohydrate antigens, and c) Improve CDC's ability to define the medical needs and appropriate prophylaxis of an anthrax-exposed population following a bioterrorism event. The CCRC's services in compositional analysis and custom synthesis of complex carbohydrates are specifically designed and organized to optimize cooperation and collaboration among disciplines and researchers. UGA/CRCC's unique combination of structural analytic expertise of raw materials provided by CDC combined with their investigation-driven ability for rational, sequential synthesis of key anthrax carbohydrate structures is unavailable from any other vendor and is fundamental to the success of the project.<br />For our specific needs this facility and its researchers are uniquely equipped to supply us with the requested products because they are able to meet our critical requirement of outstanding technical flexibility combined with highly specific scientific expertise in the biochemistry of bacterial cell wall and spore carbohydrates. Since our project objectives are a blend of basic and applied research on a tightly regulated select agent with a very strong emphasis on rapid development of medical countermeasures in the bioterrorism context, our requirements are unusual. The contractor must a) deliver structural information on chemical compounds extracted from unusually small quantities of bacterial cell wall and spores, b) use newly developed synthetic chemistry methodology to produce and test customized intermediates of complex carbohydrate structures and the final product in small quantities. <br />The new synthetic chemistry strategy and methodologies are unique to the CCRC, have not been published and are not available in the public domain at this time.<br />Aspects of the required synthetic structures and syntheses are patent pending by the UGA CCRC (US Patent 60/933,937; "Anthrax Carbohydrates, Synthesis and Uses Thereof").
<p><br />This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to The University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center under authority of 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1) FAR 6.302-1 Note 22 applies herein. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Procurement and Grants Office, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341, Reference 2010-82246. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov. The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.406-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with The University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

2.  Description of Supplies/ServicesAir Traffic Surveillance/Automation Simulator Software Package to support the Flight Operations Simulation Laboratory (FOSL) and Flight Operations Simulation Branch (AFS-440) in the collection of human-in-the-loop data, in a real time simulation environment.  3.  Total Estimated Value and Period of Performance The cost estimate for the Software Package license is $860,625.00, with an option to purchase two additional license modules and maintenance for $320,625.00.4.  Authority The authority for this single source procurement is AMS policy section 3.2.2.4.5.  Reasons for Single SourceA Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of capabilities was posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website on March 22, 2010.  The Program Office reviewed all packages submitted.  Although there were companies that responded that could provide some of the capabilities required in the Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and could develop a software package that could meet the majority of the requirements, none of the company's software capabilities were compatible with the existing ASATng software.  None of the companies provided statements of having a pre-developed software package that met the requirements of the Statement of Work.  The time it would take to develop a software program and integrate it into our existing systems would be costly for the FAA in comparison of purchasing a pre-develop software system.6.  QuestionsA competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Questions regarding this announcement may be sent by email to Harold.hannah@faa.gov no later than 26 May 2010.

<CONTACT>Belal Hammad, Contract Specialist, Phone 7033052262, Email belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to assess the Dynamics of SNAP Participation in the Mid-2000s.
<p>FNS is sponsoring the latest study in a series that will update and expand our knowledge of the dynamics of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The study will provide updated measures of SNAP participation dynamics and expanded examination of individuals' circumstances that trigger SNAP entries and exits and influence the length of time participants remain on SNAP. The analysis on spell lengths will include both a cohort analysis and a cross-sectional analysis.</p>
<p>The study has three objectives:</p>
<p>1.Update SNAP participation dynamics, including entry rates, spell lengths, exit rates, and reentry rates, which are comparable to previous estimates.<br />2.Describe the participation dynamics of subgroups.<br />3.Further explore circumstances that influence SNAP entries and exits.</p>
<p>The main data source that will be used to examine SNAP participation dynamics is the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). This study will use the 2004 longitudinal panel for SIPP. This data can be accessed at the following URL: http://www.census.gov/sipp/.</p>
<p>SIPP is a nationally representative, longitudinal survey of the resident non-institutionalized population in the U.S., conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data are collected every four months about each preceding month of the reference period or wave to minimize recall error. Topical Modules are administered every wave covering specific socioeconomic and demographic items. The module that focuses on respondents' history of employment and program participation is administered in the first wave.</p>
<p>This is a per-solicitation note. The solicitation will be released in the beginning of June, 2010.</p>

This area is located in the Gallatin National Forest-Hebgen Lake Ranger District, northwest of the town of West Yellowstone and west of Yellowstone National Park. 
(To prepare for this redesign work, the Forest worked with two Forest Service interpretive planners who created a conceptual interpretive plan, entitled  EARTHQUAKE LAKE GEOLOGIC AREA:  INTERPRETIVE PLAN, USDA, FS, Reg. 1, October 2009    That document, while helping to guide this current redesign work in concept, will neither constrain nor limit the creative interpretive design work for this contract.)

This contract requires NO fabrication, construction or installation work. 

This contract requires that the contractor provide all final design work for all interpretive elements in a format with sufficient detail, data and information that will enable the Forest Service (FS) to immediately incorporate it into contracts for fabrication, construction and installation services that would be advertised and awarded most likely the following year (CY2011).

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Environmental Public Health Division?s Human Studies Facility (HSF) in RTP, North Carolina intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with SpaceLabs Healthcare for the purchase of an upgraded Medical Telemetry Electrocardiographic (ECG) system at the EPA/HSF.  The ECG is required for conducting clinical research studies at the Environmental Public Health Division?s Human Studies Facility.  All human volunteers are required to be monitored in real time while being exposed to various air pollutants. This telemetry system allows medical personnel to monitor a subject from anywhere in the building, and to terminate testing/experimentation if unsafe ECG patterns appear.The USEPA requires a contractor with the unique capability to interact with the existing equipment and internal writing system that is already in place.  The upgraded system will replace the antenna system and central processing capability of the existing SpaceLabs telemetry system in the HSF. The upgraded system must be compatible with all remaining SpaceLabs equipment that provides patient monitoring capabilities in subject testing locations throughout the HSF.  The system currently in use is a proprietary SDLC (serial data link communication) infrastructure already in place at the EPA.  The SDLC allows remote operation and monitoring of patient interface modules (up to 200 ft.) during chamber exposures.  This prevents the investigators from being required to enter the exposure atmosphere to acquire data. The upgraded system must network to the existing system for bed-to-bed communication, beside printing to networked laser printers, and print storage via the SpaceLabs ICS print manager application.  To install any other vendors system would require a complete removal and installation of the entire patient monitoring system which would result in enormous downtime of ongoing research.SpaceLabs Healthcare is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirement(s) because of the proprietary equipment and internal writing system currently being utilized EPA/HSF of which is not being replaced.However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

There is a guaranteed minimum of $100k for each awardee.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Construction; Subsection 236 - Construction of Buildings with a size standard $33.5 Million; Subsector 237 - Heavy Construction with a size standard $13 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities) and Subsector 238 - Specialty Trade Contractors - Size standard $14 Million. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos/lead-based paint abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete, masonry, steel, painting, roofing and paving, locations of work will be at Eielson AFB, AK and may include Clear AS, Air Force Recreational site at Birch Lake, or in any of the various exercise and bomb ranges in interior Alaska (the PACIFIC Alaska Range Complex, or PARC). Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code under 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p><br />A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) contracts (three Hub Zone certified business concerns), who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The magnitude of the seed project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br />The seed projects general description is as follows:</p>
<p>The intent of project is to completely renovate the Army Lift Station, Building 2212, during which time the awardee shall provide interim grinding and pumping of sewerage to the Eielson Waste Water Treatment Plant. The Air Force requires a complete and functional design and renovation of this lift station, appropriate for the sub-arctic environment of interior Alaska and that meet all applicable current requirements of all applicable codes. The lift station was originally constructed in 1953 with new equipment installed in 1991. The Army lift station has become outdated and has reached the conclusion of its expected normal duty life. Maintenance issues are becoming more frequent and failure of existing equipment is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Up to three (3) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. Evaluation factors will be defined in the RFP. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project. All future task orders will be competed among contract awardees.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 17 Mar 2009 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />A site visit will be conducted at Eielson AFB, on or around 24 March 2010 (exact date, time and location will be provided in the RFP), for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved with the project and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Any questions must be submitted in writing, please send them by e-mail to both SrA Mark A. Chranowski, mark.chranowski@eielson.af.mil (907-377-0108) and Mr. Jonathan Dittmer, johnathan.dittmer@eielson.af.mil. (907-377-5444). QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN BY PHONE CALL.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Specification for the purchase of non-armored outside plant fiber optic cablewith 216 strands of single mode fiber.No supplied cable segment shall exceed 10K feet. If total order equals 50Kfeet, it shall be shipped on five (5) reels ETC. Fibers supplied in a DRY BLOCK All- Dielectric Outdoor Cable.Cable construction must meet ANSI/CERA S-87-640-1999 STANDARD FOROPTICAL OUTSIDE PLANT COMMUNICATIONS CABLE.Single-mode Fiber strands must meet ITU-T G.652.D.Single mode fibers will attenuate 1300nm/1550nm at 0.50/0.40 db/kl or better.The cable shall meet all requirements stated in the specification below:The cable shall be an accepted product of the United States Department ofAgricultureRural Utilities Service (RUS) 7 CFR 1755.900 (PE-90) and meet therequirements of ANSI/ICEA Standard for Fiber Optic Outside PlantCommunications Cable, ANSI/ICEA S-87-640-2006.For cables containing more than 12 buffer tubes, standard colors are used fortubes 1 through 12 and stripes are used to denote tubes 13 through 24. Thecolor sequence applies to tubes containing fibers only, and shall begin with thefirst tube. If fillers are required, they shall be placed in the inner layer ofthecable. The tube color sequence shall start from the inside layer and progressoutward.Fillers may be included in the cable core to lend symmetry to the cablecross-section where needed. Fillers shall be placed so that they do notinterruptthe consecutive positioning of the buffer tubes. In dual layer cables, anyfillersshall be placed in the inner layer. Fillers shall be nominally 2.5 mm or 3.0 mminouter diameter.The central member shall consist of a dielectric, glass reinforced plastic (GRP)rod (optional steel central member). The purpose of the central member is toprovide tensile strength and prevent buckling. The central member shall beovercoated with a thermoplastic when required to achieve dimensional sizing toaccommodate buffer tubes/fillers.Each buffer tube shall contain a water-swellable yarn or water blocking elementfor water-blocking protection. The water-swellable yarn or water blockingelement shall be non-nutritive to fungus, electrically non-conductive, andhomogeneous. It shall also be free from dirt or foreign matter. This yarn orelement will preclude the need for other water-blocking material; the buffer-tubeshall be gel-free.The optical fibers shall not require cleaning before placement into a splicetrayor fan-out kit.For single layer cables, a water swellable tape shall be applied longitudinallyaround the outside of the stranded tubes/fillers. The water swellable tape shallbe non-nutritive to fungus, electrically non-conductive, and homogenous. Itshall also be free from dirt and foreign matter.For dual layer cables, a second (outer) layer of buffer tubes shall be strandedover the original core to form a two layer core. A water swellable tape shall beapplied longitudinally over both the inner and outer layer. The water swellabletape shall be non-nutritive to fungus, electrically non-conductive, andhomogenous. It shall also be free from dirt and foreign matter.cables shall be sheathed with medium density polyethylene(MDPE). The minimum nominal jacket thickness shall be 1.3 mm. For reduceddiameter (RD) cables, the minimum nominal jacket thickness shall be 1.4mm.Jacketing material shall be applied directly over the tensile strength members(as required) and water swellable tape. The polyethylene shall contain carbonblack to provide ultraviolet light protection and shall not promote the growthoffungus.Cable jackets shall be marked with the manufacturer's name, month and yearofmanufacture, sequential meter or foot markings, a telecommunication handsetsymbol as required by Section 350G of the National Electrical Safety Code(NESC), fiber count, and fiber type. The actual length of the cable shall bewithin -0/+1% of the length markings. The print color shall be white, with theexception that cable jackets containing one or more coextruded white stripes,which shall be printed in light blue. The height of the marking shall beapproximately 2.5 mm.When tested in accordance a standard  "Fluid Penetration Test forFluid-Blocked Fiber Optic Cable," a one meter length of unaged cable shallwithstand a one meter static head or equivalent continuous pressure of waterfor one hour without leakage through the open cable end.When tested in accordance with FOTP-81, "Compound Flow (Drip) Test forFilled Fiber Optic Cable," the cable shall exhibit no flow (drip or leak) offillingand/or flooding material at 70aC.

<p>Project Description: Project 0700192, Renovate Facility 20011, Phase II. The scope is the interior gut and renovation of the second floor of bldg 11 and replacement of the windows on the first and second floor. Second floor interior work includes complete reconfiguring of the floor plan to allow optimum space utilization. Work includes replacement of all electrical wiring, light fixtures, ceiling system, communications, fire detection &amp; suppression system, and finishes. New windows will be the original size as opposed to the current smaller opening. This will require removal of the infill that was installed when the current replacement windows were installed and some structural reinforcement. <br /><br />Building is a historic facility and is subject to SHPO oversight. Due to this the replacement window system used will have to pass several review hurdles. Contractor must be familiar with Historical Preservation requirements and concerns. This building will remain occupied on the first and basement levels during construction.

The contractor will need proper man power in all relevant disciplines to work continuous in one work area and finish the work before moving on to the next area. Furthermore, in order to reduce the impact to NASIC's mission, only part of the work area will be vacated at a time. So, this project will require phasing. The customer has agreed to vacate &frac12; the space to allow the contractor access to the 1st phase. The other side will remain occupied while the 1st phase is completed. The contractor will have to develop a phasing plan, and the performance period is very short for this size of project.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude for this entire project is between: $1,000,000 and $5,000,000</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with an estimated period of performance of 120 days.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are certified 8(a) program participants, HUBZone or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on (1 Week from date of posting) 2010.</p>
<p>Responses should include the following:</p>
<p>(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor;</p>
<p>(2) a copy of 8(a) approval/certification;</p>
<p>(3) date of HUBZone certification;</p>
<p>(4) documentation of SDVOSB status;</p>
<p>(5) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project;</p>
<p>(6) documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;</p>
<p>(7) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture.</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation by email(preferred) or fax. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested certified 8(a) program participants, HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages. Please include your DUNS number and your CAGE code. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

<DESC>The RDECOM Acquisition center is seeking potential sources to provide Operantion and Maintenance services at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Commerce City, Colorado. The installation was established in 1942, to manufacture chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, white phosphorus and napalm.<BR><BR>After World War II, a portion of the facility was leased to private industry including Julius Hyman and Co. and subsequenslty to Shell Chemical Company. Wastes generated during production years at the Arsenal were disposed of using widely accepted practices of the time. Efforts to contain liquid wastes began soon after the discovery that contaminated groundwater had caused crop damage north of the Arsenal in the mid 1950s.<BR><BR>The Army and Shell began a systematic investigation into the contamination problems which resulted in the Armys Installation Restoration Program. In the late 1980s, Interim Response Actions (IRAs) were designed and implemented to protect public health, the surrounding community, and the environment from Arsenal contamination. Included in the 14 IRAs was the modification of existing groundwater treatment systems and the construction and operation of new groundwater treatment systems both on and off the site. <BR><BR>In 1989, a Federal Facility Agreement for RMA was signed which set forth procedures for remediation. The Off-Post Record of Decision (ROD),  was signed Dec. 19, 1995, and the On-Post ROD, signed on June 11, 1996,  providing the framework, purpose and overall rationale for the cleanup actions being accomplished at the site. The remedy outlined in the On-Post ROD is nearing completion and the site is transitioning to long-term operations and maintenance of the facilities, landfills, and covers.<BR><BR>Work required off-post included  construction of the Off-Post Groundwater Intercept and Treatment System (OGITS). Treatment of groundwater at the OGITS is ongoing. 	<BR>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)-Equivalent Cover systems have been constructed and planted with native vegetation.  The cover systems are comprised of the Integrated Cover System (ICS) (which includes the Lime Basins Cover, the Basin A Cover, the South Plants Cover and the Complex (Army) Trenches Cover), Basin F Cover, and the Shell Disposal Trenches Cover.  Each of these covers is in a 5-year period of vegetation establishment, the earliest of which (Shell Trenches), will be completed in 2013.  The ICS also includes the 2- and 3-foot covers.  Once the covers have been determined to be operational and functional (O&F), Part 2 construction completion reports (CCRs) will be written to document the operational and functional determination.  Inspections and maintenance are currently being performed as specified in the RCRA-Equivalent, 2-, and 3-Foot Covers Long-Term Care Plan (LTCP).<BR><BR>The construction of both the Hazardous Waste Landfill (HWL) and the Enhanced Hazardous Waste Landfill (ELF) is complete.  Both facilities are being maintained in accordance with their respective Post-Closure Plans (PCPs).  <BR><BR>The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, vehicles, tools, supplies, materials, and other items and services necessary to perform all functions required for the Operation and Maintenance of the Army retained facilities and land on the RMA. The work scope includes, but is not limited to, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the Water Treatment Plants, Groundwater Wells and Surface Water Sampling and Monitoring, Landfills and Covers Maintenance, Infrastructure and Facilities Maintenance, Regulatory Interface Support, Program Records and Reporting, Land Use Controls Compliance, and Environmental Compliance.<BR><BR> Interested parties should respond to this notice by June 2, 2010. A response should include the following information: Name/address of the company, a point of contact within the firm and a summary of the corporate resources that could be allocated to this work along with a short summary of relevant past experience in performing similiar work.<BR><BR>Interested parties are caoutioned that the Government does not assume any liability to pay for this information . This markety survey is for information and planning purposes only . Electronic submittals are preferred and should be sent to Mr. Hugh P. Blaney at hugh.blaney@us.army.mil. If a formal soliciation is issued, a separate soliciation notice will be published.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and does not constitute a solicitation for proposal.<BR>The Joint Project Manager, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical  Contamination Avoidance (JPM-NBC-CA) is conducting market research to identify potential sources to provide Block Upgrade engineering design services, contractor testing,  integration/installation of new subsystems and logistics support [i.e. source data for technical manual (TM) revision, test vehicle refurbishment, preparation of ECP package for any changes to the system, etc.] on the Fox Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Reconnaissance Systems (NBCRS) variants [M93A1, M93A1P1, and M93A1P2 series vehicles].  No technical data package (TDP) is available for any of the Fox NBCRS variants.  Block Upgrades could cover a range of subsystems to potentially include engine (power pack) upgrade, engineering and production efforts to replace obsolete subsystems, replacement of and/or integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) sensors on any of the 3 Fox variants.  The Fox NBCRS is in the Operations and Support (O&S) phase of the Department of Defense (DOD)s Integrated Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Life Cycle Management Framework.  <BR>Background:  Prime Contractor<BR><BR>Thyssen Henschel (Germany) produced the first Fox platforms that the U.S. Army acquired in the mid 1980s.  Much of the technology of the base vehicle platform dates to the mid 1980s.<BR>General Dynamics Land Systems/Rheinmettall Landsysteme (RLS) (formerly Thyssen Henschel) are the original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and have been maintaining and upgrading the U.S. Army Fox NBCRS inventory since 1996.  The Fox inventory consists of one hundred twenty-two (122) vehicles. The Fox fleet is comprised of 86 M93A1, 22 of the up-armored M93A1P1, and 14 of the most recently upgraded up-armored M93A1P2.   The Fox vehicles are currently located at multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations.  <BR>The GFE subsystems currently installed on the Fox variants include, but are not limited to, the M88 Chemical Agent Point Detector, M21 Standoff Chemical Agent Detector, MM1 Mobile Mass Spectrometer, AN/VDR-2 RADIAC, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade-and-Below (FBCB2), CBRN Processing Group for warning and reporting, and Enhanced Positioning and Locating Receiver System (EPLRS) and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).<BR>Interested sources that believe they can perform the above requirements, without a Fox TDP, shall submit a statement of interest and a brief company profile highlighting relevant experience and qualifications showing they have the capability to accomplish the specified range of work requirements.  The submission shall be a minimum of two pages detailing the requested company information and examples highlighting relevant experience.

Finally, interested sources should also include the type of production facilities and tools available to perform similar production design and integration efforts.<BR><BR>Participation in this market survey is voluntary, and the Government shall not pay any costs associated with this sources sought announcement.  Failure to provide detailed information to the survey may limit opportunities for products/services to be considered for future requirements associated with the Fox NBCRS program.<BR><BR>This Market Survey is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. There will be no opportunity for questions and answers associated with this RFI.<BR><BR>All proprietary data that the respondent intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes must be identified and appropriately marked.

<DESC><p><br />The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005 requires the Secretary to expand the domains of Hospital Quality of Care Measures for public reporting on Hospital Compare (HC) to include Outcomes/Efficiency in addition to process of care mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003. In compliance with these requirements, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) developed and posted six 30-Day Mortality and Readmission Measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure (HF) and Pneumonia on HC incrementally since 2007. However, these measures are claims-based and limited to measuring outcomes of medical conditions. To provide the public with a broader spectrum of quality measures, CMS plans to expand the domains of the measures posted on HC to include surgical outcomes, preferably outcomes based on clinical data such as the registry data.</p>
<p>The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has developed five risk-adjusted Surgical Outcome Measures using the clinical data collected by the NSQIP. The five measures are listed below.</p>
<p>1. Risk Adjusted Lower Extremity Bypass (LEB) Surgery Outcomes<br />2. Risk Adjusted Colorectal Surgery Outcome Measure<br />3. Risk Adjusted Case Mix Adjusted Elderly Surgery Outcomes Measure<br />4. Risk Adjusted Surgical Site Infection Outcome Measure<br />5. Risk Adjusted Urinary Tract Infection Outcome Measure</p>
<p>One of these ACS measures, Lower Extremity Bypass Surgery Complications, was recently endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and the other four have been submitted to the NQF and are currently undergoing evaluation. Since the risk adjustment methodology of the four measures under NQF evaluation is similar to that of the endorsed LEB measure, they are likely to be endorsed.</p>
<p>CMS is considering adopting these measures for public reporting on HC since they met CMS's program need for outcome measures that are based on clinical data. Currently hospitals are collecting and submitting to CMS the clinical data elements needed to calculate 44 chart-based process-of-care measures for posting on HC in order to obtain their Annual Payment Update. The clinical data elements necessary to calculate these ACS measures are not part of the data elements submitted to CMS by hospitals for these 44 measures. Adopting these ACS measures for reporting on HC would clearly add additional data collection burden to hospitals. Therefore prior to adopting these measures, CMS would benefit from the information regarding the degree the data collection burden will increase for hospitals. Specifically the information that CMS is seeking is whether some (or all, if feasible) of the clinical data elements necessary to calculate the ACS measures can be replaced with existing claim data. The purpose is to minimize data collection burden for hospitals without compromising the integrity of the measure methodology.<br /><br />This Purchase Order is to request the ACS to conduct analyses to explore ways to elucidate whether the risk adjustment embedded in the ACS measure methodology can be performed using a hybrid database (i.e., a mix of chart and claims data) or a database with claims data only. The findings of this investigation is important to inform CMS decision making on public reporting of the ACS surgical outcome measures on HC.</p>

<DESC>Information Center services are being sought for the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Information Center (NEIC). NEIC is EIA's window to the public and handles media relations and communications, leads in improvements to the EIA website, and runs a Customer Information Center (CIC) that users call or email to obtain help finding energy information. The CIC serves as a critical component in helping EIA fulfill its mission to promote sound policy making, efficient markets, and public understanding regarding energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. It supports EIA in numerous ways, such as interpreting data and responding to customer and stakeholders' inquiries, creating and maintaining energy content, and assisting customers in navigating EIA's website. The site consists of approximately 500,000 files of all types that support the agency?s 1300 publications and products, 38 email subscription lists, and 9 RSS feeds.
The CIC serves EIA customers and stakeholders through multichannel communications (e.g., telephone, email, and postal mail) and builds on decades of excellence in customer service by providing high quality and accurate responses tailored to the customer?s needs.  CIC recently implemented a unified communications platform, Interactive Intelligence?s Interaction Client (IC), to enhance its customer service by providing 24 hour access to energy information on an automated Interactive Voice Response system (IVR) and integrating data reporting (e.g., email and voice inquiries) to gain more knowledge about customer data needs.
Customers and stakeholders include, but are not limited to: Federal, State, and local agencies; the academic community; researchers; industrial and commercial organizations; foreign governments and international organizations; the news media; financial institutions, and the general public.  In 2009, CIC provided responses to approximately 20,000 inquiries.  Ninety percent of total inquiries were generated by five customer groups: researchers, industrial and commercial organizations, academia, financial institutions and the general public. Call length averages is 4 minutes and 27 seconds. To learn more about the EIA and NEIC, visit www.eia.gov.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Hydrodynamic Facilities and Engineering Department (Code 51) of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is requesting information from available sources regarding a pending upgrade to an existing wind tunnel motor drive.
BACKGROUND:  The 8x10 Sub-Sonic Wind Tunnel (8x10) facility is located at the NSWCCD site in West Bethesda, MD.  Operation of the tunnel is accomplished by driving a 16 ft diameter fan using a 1000 horsepower wound-rotor induction motor (WRIM).  Operation of the WRIM fan motor is via a "Clymer-Type" drive system.  This system recovers the slip energy from the WRIM via slip rings on the rotor to generate output power.
Clymer Drive:  The layout of the Clymer Drive is as follows: the slip rings of the WRIM are directly connected to the synchronous motor of a variable speed synchronous motor/dc generator set.  The dc generator of the variable speed set is connected to a dc motor of a constant speed dc motor/synchronous generator set.  During start up, the constant speed set is started, and the fields of the dc machine are driven to bring the variable speed set up to synchronous speed.  When the variable speed set reaches synchronous speed, the fields of the variable speed synchronous motor are applied, generating fields on the WRIM rotor through the slip rings.  The incoming line is then closed to the stator of the WRIM and the motor begins running.  At zero rpm, the magnetic fields in the rotor and stator of the WRIM are rotating at the same frequency, essentially chasing each other around the motor.  To increase the speed of the WRIM from zero, the fields are adjusted on the dc machines to slow the speed of the variable speed synchronous motor.  This in turn slows the fields of the WRIM rotor, causing it to spin.
WRIM:  Specifications for the motor are listed below:
	     NAME PLATE DATA	Make: GE	Model:  8023325        Frame:  579-Y	Type:  M        Volt:  2300	Amp:  220        3 Phase	        Sec. Volt: 935	Sec. Amp:  550        Cyc:  60	Spd Full Load:  810        1110/1000 HP	Serial #:  5632847

INFORMATION REQUESTED: NSWCCD requests information regarding availability of COTS products and/or design/build services for the replacement of the current drive system in the 8x10.  NSWCCD is interested specifically in a solid-state slip power recovery drive or equivalent that will drive the existing WRIM without modifications to the motor - i.e. shorting the slip rings, etc.  The system must also include a contactor or remote electrically controlled breaker for applying and breaking the 2400 VAC line to the WIRM stator.  The drive must allow the speed to be controlled remotely via a 0-10 V or 4-20 mA signal, and must also be controllable from the front of the drive.  Tolerances should be +/- 1% or better on the drive output frequency through the full frequency range.Information submitted should also include a rough-order-of-magnitude estimate of the cost to upgrade the existing wind tunnel motor drive.
The information may be submitted not later than 18 June 2010 to the following address or email:

<DESC>*** This Sources Sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. ***   The intent of this notice is to determine the availability of qualified commercial sources capable of providing Hospital Environmental Services for designated Military Treatment Facilities on Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, TX.<BR><BR>Fort Sam Houston (FSH) and Camp Bullis military installations are home to multiple Army Medical Department (AMEDD) tenant units, also referred to as direct reporting units (DRUs).  The AMEDD DRUs are comprised of multiple healthcare and healthcare-related facilities and buildings, commonly referred to as Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  MTFs are medical facilities operated by the military and vary in capabilities in partnership with healthcare providers, medical educators, and medical researchers.  The following AMEDD DRUs are located on Fort Sam Houston: San Antonio Military Medical Center-North(SAMMC-N)/Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) under the Southern Regional Medical Command SRMC) co-located with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) under the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC); U.S. Army Veterinary Command (VETCOM); U.S. Army Dental Command (DENCOM); Warrior Transition Command (WTC), and Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDD C&S).  For this effort, MTFs is a collective term of 54 integrated medical, dental, veterinary, and other medical department healthcare and healthcare-related facilities and buildings located on Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, TX.  The raw square feet (RSF) applicable to hospital environmental services are varied for each MTF; as such, the current aggregate raw square feet (RSF) of all MTFs is 1,863,382.  The aggregate RSF of all MTFs is projected to increase to approximately 2,800,000 (exclusive of 1.75M parking lot and garages) not later than September 2011 (see SAMMC-N website http://www.sammc.army.mil/ for San Antonio Military BRAC Information Office (SAMBIO) published updates, move bulletins, and information) due to in-progress base closure and realignment (BRAC) construction and renovation projects.  The BRAC projects include the integration/ consolidation of Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) and Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) into one (1) regional medical center with two integrated campuses known as San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC). BAMC will become the inpatient tertiary care center providing all inpatient care as well as all trauma and emergency medical care and will be referred to as SAMMC  North.  WHMC will be converted into a large ambulatory care center and will be referred to as SAMMC  South.  This effort is exclusive of hospital environmental services for SAMMC-S (WHMC).  <BR><BR>Description of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, tools, materials, management, and supervision (except for those items specified as government-furnished property, supplies, equipment and services) necessary to perform non-personal, hospital environmental services (HES) to MTFs located on Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, TX.  HES are inclusive of hospital housekeeping (aseptic and non-aseptic), control and exchange of linen, regulated medical waste (RMW) collection and removal, general waste (trash) collection and removal, recycle collection and removal, document shredding, and exterior building services (e.g., windows, doors, walkways, parking lots) such as window cleaning, outdoor policing, and snow removal.  Aseptic housekeeping is distinguished from non-aseptic housekeeping in that the primary work of the former is to maintain total disinfection conditions in designated areas of MTFs.  The Contractor shall provide HES consistent with the most modern and scientific methods of environmental service practices and techniques to include the highest level of sanitary procedures.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561720 and the annual size standard in millions of dollars is $16.5.   The agency is seeking industry information and comments from sources with capabilities to perform the contract and with relevant experience in all of the functional areas mentioned above.  Interested parties shall complete and submit the attached Market Research Questionnaire and Experience Reporting Form to the Government.  Responses to the Sources Sought are encouraged from all interested parties.  DISCLAIMER: DO NOT SUBMIT A NARRATIVE, PROPOSAL, BROCHURES OR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. Based upon the responses received, the Government will determine the set-aside method for the procurement. This is a sources sought announcement and is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. An award will not be made on responses to this notice. This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a Request for Proposal (RFP); it is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability of sources prior to issuing a solicitation.  Interested parties may submit their response to kathleen.henderson@amedd.army.mil no later than 28 May 2010, 3:00 PM (CST) via e-mail.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR><BR>1.0  SUBJECT:  The Program Management Office-Medical Support Systems (PMO-MSS) of the U.S. Army Medical Material Development Activity (USAMMDA) is conducting market research to determine whether a commercial system is available to meet the requirements for a litter carrier solution for transport within facilities (e.g., combat support hospitals) and external to facilities involving transport over various types of terrain within the continental United States (CONUS) as well as outside the continental United States (OCONUS). This market research may also assist with the further development and/or refinement of the requirements.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on June 3, 2010.  See section 5.0 for further information.<BR><BR>2.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under the in-place patient decontamination initiative will not be entertained.<BR><BR>3.0 DESCRIPTION: PMO-Medical Support Systems, USAMMDA has a requirement to replace this current NATO litter carrier with a new model of similar design or a COTS item that can replace the existing device. This device must effectively be able to transport litter-borne patients in a variety of field medical venues among the different military services. This includes transport within facilities (e.g., combat support hospitals) and external to facilities (involving transport over various types of terrain). For many years, U.S. military services have used the NATO litter carrier (NSN 6530-01-220-7186) as the primary means of transporting litter-borne patients. This device has also been used to transport various medical materiel in and around different facilities. A replacement litter carrier is now needed because the NATO device is no longer procurable. The NATO litter carrier allows two users to quickly transport a patient on a standard NATO stretcher. The two-wheeled carrier is equipped with four rotary-style clamps used to secure the litter in place. The carrier includes two pairs of legs for placement of the litter into a stationary position at a fixed height. A foot release is provided on each side to unlock the legs, which then fold out of the way for patient transport. Each set of litter carriers requites a tire pump and patch kit for maintaining the pneumatic tires. For storage and palletizing, the wheels detach from the outside of the carrier. The wheels are then placed inside the frame, which folds up to secure them in place. This RFI is investigating the possibility of finding new vendors to produce the existing litter carrier with small modifications to the design using the current technical data package, or similar COTS items that can meet the requirements that are mentioned below.   <BR><BR>Specific Essential Characteristics (ECs) have not yet been developed for a new litter carrier; however, due to impending procurement needs, a preliminary market survey was requested by USAMMA to identify products on the market that are functionally similar to the existing product. ECs would be a part of any new procurement and would be presented if an RFP were to<BR>be issued to the general public. <BR><BR>4.0 REQUIREMENTS: <BR><BR>Materials<BR>The wheeled litter carrier should be made of aluminum; corrosion-resisting steel screws, fasteners, etc.; nylon webbing, and Roleez-type wheels.<BR><BR>Function<BR>The wheeled litter carrier will allow two people to transport a patient on a NATO stretcher. The carrier should function to transport patients in hospitals as well as through sand, mud, snow, debris, and rough, uneven terrain., and should operate in hot and cold environments ranging from 60 F to 120 F. In addition to moving patients, the litter carrier should also be able to function in a stationary position as a litter stand.<BR><BR>Design<BR>Ideally, assembly should take 30 seconds, but assembly should take no longer than 1 minute and require few or no special tools. When assembled and open, the measurements should be 28 H  35 L  28 W or 42 W with Roleez wheels.<BR><BR>Disassembly should also be easy and quick. The litter carrier should collapse for storage: the frame should fold and the wheels should detach and fit inside the frame. When folded for storage, the litter carriers frame should be approximately 8 H  39 L  24 W, and two personnel must be able to easily move the litter carrier.<BR><BR>Because the carrier will hold not only the patient but also the patients gear and medical equipment, the wheeled litter carrier should hold at least 350 pounds (T), but 500 pounds (O) is desired. Also, the litter carrier itself should not weigh more than 50 pounds as not to add to the weight litter bearers already have to carry. The litter carrier should be able to accommodate the standard Army (NSN 6530-00-783-7905) and Talon II stretcher.<BR><BR>Rotary style clamps will be used to secure the litter in place. Head End and Foot End should be stenciled in white paint to identify the patients position on the wheeled litter carrier.<BR><BR>The litter carrier should be resistant to bleach used in decontamination and be able to accommodate personnel working in Level C HAZMAT personal protective equipment (PPE).<BR><BR>The wheels should rotate freely, slide easily into the axle, and be held with a securing pin. When the litter carrier is being used on wheels, legs on springs should be held against the frame. When the litter carrier is used in a stationary position and the legs are down, the wheels should not at all or barely touch the floor. There should be a foot release to unlock the legs.<BR><BR>All surfaces (including the wheels) should be painted with lusterless paint conforming to green color 34094 of FED-STD-595.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the US Air Force will contract for the items contained in the Request for Information (RFI). A6OI intends to use this information to support future acquisitions. <br />II. BACKGROUND <br />This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the project and project implementation challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses. A6OI is acquiring from vendor responses specific information of their capabilities and potential technology. We also seek optimum performance features that differentiate technology from your competitors. <br />III. PURPOSE<br />A. Air Combat Command (ACC) is seeking pre-solicitation information on a DR and COOP for its bases to insure that data is available during lost of primary storage. In addition A6OI seeks to address the (1) threat of local/regional disasters at a base by moving the data from the primary storage to a remote centralize site and (2) to use the centralized remote site as a COOP platform. We request a Recover Point Objective and Recovery Time Objective of less than 8 hours. Solution must be able to digitally shred specific data without disrupting valid data. <br />B. In order to overcome natural or war-time disasters, critical e-mail and data storage must be located off base and outside of the immediate geographic area (e.g. outside of a Hampton Roads, VA area hurricane situation) of the base storage equipment. Currently, ACC utilizes a cross vendor solution of EMC and NetApp equipment; thus, management across vendors must be seamless to network operations and minimize cost and maintenance requirements. <br />C. The DR &amp; COOP covers all ACC classified (Secret Collateral level) and unclassified networks. The primary objective is for restoral of Base Exchange and designated critical data. ACC seeks to implement a turnkey solution to achieve maximize efficiency of disk storage recovery independent of the production storage unit. This project must maximize efficiency of WAN bandwidth for replication from the local storage units to an off-base DR &amp; COOP sites using a disk-based system. The solution is to provide data protection and integrity, leverage existing backup software while supporting the future capability of local online archiving and high availability. The proposal will include all migration services with automation setups and configuration activities. The proposal will include training and all software and hardware requirements for a successful implementation. It must be able to digitally shred specific data without disrupting valid data.
<p>IV. ITEMS OF SIGNIFICANCE</p>
<p>A. Accredited to use in the Air Force or DoD; request references<br />B. Support backup/recovery administration using CommVault. <br />C. Enterprise and local level de-duplication regardless of interface or application<br />D. Capable of supporting archiving <br />E. Provide proven and documented de-duplication rates that support AF and DoD customers<br />F. Must be able to digitally shred specific data without disrupting valid data; must adhere to DoD 5220.22-M sanitization matrix and NIST 800-88 <br />G. Must support a virtualized environment using VMware<br />H. Maximize unified centralized management<br />I. Support one-to-one and many-to-one replications over remote sites<br />J. Provide throughput rate between primary and backup targets<br />K. Offer RAID protection<br />L. Minimal floor space, power, cooling and management requirements<br />M. The storage devices shall ideally be a self-contained disk system; however, other solutions which minimize maintenance support requirements will also be reviewed<br />N. Provides maximum capable expansion size to demonstrate future scalability<br />O. Must have at least 5 customers in the DoD using in-line deduplication; references must be provided</p>
<p><br />V. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS</p>
<p>A. Request responses to be broken into two parts. Part 1 is for the local backup to support remote replication to an off-site DR site; and the second part is for the off-site COOP. Both parts can be integrated but must be clearly distinct.<br />B. The document should be formatted in 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins<br />C. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with ACC RFI-XX-XX (This page is not included in the white paper page count);<br />D.

The Technology Management Office (TMO) is tasked to archive and maintain a central repository for information related to SAPs and sensitive activities.<BR><BR>The Sensitive Technical Archive and Retrieval System (STARS) is the legacy electronic archive system for Army Special Access Program (SAP) and sensitive activity historical files.  The system operated by the Technology Management Office (TMO) was established to provide long term archival and retrieval support to the SAP and sensitive activity community.  Files were archived using Kofax document ingestion software and Convera Retrievalware for document searches.  The result created TIFF (an image of the document) and a text (metadata) file format for every document scanned.  The system relied on a proprietary scanner and a complex document management workflow using obsolete technology.<BR><BR>Because of increasing maintenance costs, TMO decided to deactivate its existing archival system (STARS) pending an internal review of archiving procedures and technology.  As a result, TMO shifted archiving operations from the legacy STARS system to the TMO internal local area network.  Currently, TMO has the hardware infrastructure to support a document management system but lacks the software to implement.<BR><BR>To meet the regulatory provisions of AR 380-381, TMO requires a new technological approach to implement records management modernization and compliance efforts.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (ARIEM), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA  93117.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The need is for an optical imaging device that can quantify functional activity within the brain, mainly the prefrontal cortex.  The purchase from Biopac is for a fNIR Imager made by the company fNIR devices. The aim of the research protocol for which this device is to be used is to obtain functional imaging within the prefrontal cortex with a low lost portable device. This forehead mounted sensor unit will use near infrared light to quantify the oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin activity within the prefrontal cortex. The fNIRS device sold through Biopac is the only optical brain imaging hardware that is portable, lightweight, and with low energy expenditure (used LED in lieu of more common laser technology). Additionally the included software is unique in that it automates artifact rejection of the acquired data.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>fNIRS Devices sold through Biopac is the only manufacturer to come to market with this new imaging modality. Other products of similar qualification have only been demonstrated in theoretical laboratory environments and have yet to make it to market. Earlier prototypes of this device has proven its efficacy in research studies conducted at Drexel University.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>Market research was conducted through communication with researchers at Rowan University and Drexel University, two institutes that lead in the field of fNIRS imaging. Additionally, market research was conducted on the internet and yielded no comparable devices. <BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   <BR><BR>The field of LED based fNIR imaging for the human brain is an emerging field. It is important that research conducted with such devices fall in line and build on finding from other researchers. Since this will be used in stress and traumatic brain injury studies, the most prevalent device used in these works has been chosen.<BR> <BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  None<BR>	<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: stephen.reffel@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 p.m. on May 24, 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Stephen Reffel, Contract Specialist<BR>Stephen.reffel@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>Task Order No. R10PD80R13 against IDIQ Contract No. R09PC80029Project Title: Construction Inspection Canyon Ferry DamTAS::14 0681::TASBOR Project No. 46.000Award Amount: $94,982.00Award Date: 5/19/2010Vendor - Colorado Network Staffing DUNS 111480497. 8787 Turnpike Dr Ste 210. Westminster, CO 80031-7028.Task Order Description: Construction inspection services for a construction project at Canyon Ferry Dam and recreation area approximately 40 miles east of Helena, Montana
The above task order was issued as a non competitive, labor hour task order. In accordance with Department of the Interior Guidance Release ARRA-2010-01 contracting officers should consider placement of a task or delivery order against a bureau's or a DOl-wide Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This task order is against the Bureau of Reclamation Denver Acquisition Operations Group single award ID/IQ for technical support services R09PC80029 with Colorado Network Staffing an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. The base ID/IQ was issued as a direct award under the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) contracting program. Pursuant to FAR 19.805-1(a)(2) the anticipated dollar value of the base IDIQ contract did not exceed the competitive threshold to warrant a competitive 8(a) acquisition therefore a sole source 8(a) award was made.
A labor hour task order was determined to be appropriate for this requirement and no other contract type is suitable. The elements of consideration, prescribed by FAR 12.207 to be used as guidelines to assess whether or not a labor hour contract is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable, and the facts related to this acquisition are presented below.
a. Market research had revealed the required services are a commercial service, available under the Technical/Temporary Support Services ID/IQ contract with Colorado Network Services (CNS) an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. "CNS" has shown satisfactory past performance in providing similar services in the past.    b. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because the inspection services are required as long as construction is underway. The exact completion date of construction is unknown due to the high possibility of delays inherent in construction projects of this nature (i.e. weather, unforeseen site conditions, etc.). The anticipated construction completion date is November 30, 2010. 
c. In order to maximize the use of firm fixed prices this task order utilizes pre-priced firm fixed price hourly labor rates and includes a ceiling price based on the best estimate of the number of hours that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. The contractor is required to notify the government immediately when the total amount invoiced is expected to exceed 75% of the total amount of the order. Estimated travel-related costs and any other direct costs not covered in the labor hour rates will be reimbursed based on allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation.
d. There will be adequate Government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by Reclamation's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).   The COR will communicate daily with the construction inspector via e-mail and cell phone.  Each day the construction inspector will transmit a daily inspector report which will describe the work performed by the contractor, and identify any observed problems, etc.  The daily report will document the inspector's arrival and departure from the work site.

<DESC>This Source Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Bureau of Reclamation. The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns capable of performing the work described herein. As a result of this SS, the Bureau of Reclamation may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).
The US Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Office, Acquisitions Operations Group is performing a market survey to determine if there are an adequate number of interested and qualified firms having the capability to complete the work related to using Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) in LS-DYNA finite element analysis.  The Dam Safety Office at the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) is undergoing research, "Correct Earthquake Application in Finite Element Modeling", to determine the correct way to apply earthquake motions in explicit LS-DYNA finite element analyses and has funded a related research project to develop a better nonreflecting boundary using Perfectly Matched Layers in LS-DYNA.  The project is to merge all findings together and have Reclamation use the Perfectly Matched Layers technique.  In addition, the project relies on the experience in developing spatially varying ground motions in program EACD3D208.
Based upon response to this announcement, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside or proceed with an unrestricted solicitation. The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330 and the related small business size standard is $1 million or less. This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to Beylik Drilling & Pump Service, Inc., 3000 W. MacArthur Blvd Ste 660, Santa Ana, CA 92704-6980, for the supply and installation of safety valves and switches for an irrigation system pump.  Fabrication and installation of a new control panel that will control pump starting and stopping and will provide protection against low discharge flow, loss of prelube flow, high voltage, low voltage, phase failure, phase reversal, and motor overload for the pump installed on Waimanalo Well #1 on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  Work will also include fixing bypass valves, flow meters, and switches.
Reclamation had an emergency drought assistance contract to install a new pump for Waimanalo Well #1 for use by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.  The pump was installed using an 8(a) contractor, C & C Electrical Contractor, Inc., who subcontracted Beylik Drilling & Pump Service, Inc., to perform the actual pump installation.  Because Reclamation, as the customer, could not send any personnel to Hawaii to examine the pump location ahead of time, it was relying on second-hand information from the Hawaii Department of Agriculture regarding contract requirements.  As a result, the requirements that this contracting action seeks to satisfy were left out of the original contract.  Later, after the pump was installed, a State and Reclamation pump specialist reported that the new pump setup was missing some basic safety valves for running the pump properly.  The safety valves are required to ensure pumps shut off in the event they overheat, as personnel cannot be present to monitor them the majority of the time.  Additionally, pumps can be destroyed if allowed to overheat.  Making the required adjustments to the pump system will void the construction warranty of the original contract if the equipment is not reassembled properly.  (Because these adjustments were left out of the original contract, they are not covered under the current warranty.)  The current contractor is not interested in performing this additional work, but suggested that the pump subcontractor, Beylik Drilling & Pump Service, Inc., be used to enter into a contract with us to add the additional safety equipment to the pump.  By using the same contractor that installed the pump, the original pump warranty will remain intact.  Also, this contractor is already aware of the project site and safety equipment needs.
This notice is being provided for informational purposes only.  The anticipated award date is 05/25/2010.
Responses to this notice must be received no later than five days of the date of publication of this notice.  Inquiries will only be accepted by email to dkent@usbr.gov.  Inquiries must clearly state the solicitation number and subject.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Information Services Division, intends to negotiate with Elsevier, Inc.; New York, NY, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide one base year and 4, one-year option periods of subscription services to Compendex on Engineering Village.
<p><br />Compendex on Engineering Village is a database that offers journals and articles published solely by Engineering Village that are critical to the research conducted at NIST. Compendex on Engineering Village is a tool that has been in use at NIST for several years. NIST researchers have consistently published their own journals and articles in Engineering Village so that other NIST researchers are able to collaborate their research efforts. NIST has purchased and has access to journals, articles, and conference proceedings dating back to 1969 in Engineering Village. A tool other than Compendex on Engineering Village would not allow the integration of these existing articles. Furthermore, it would prove to be too costly for NIST to purchase engineering backfile articles from 1969 to the present time through a tool other than Compendex on Engineering Village.</p>
<p>Recent market research results show that Elsevier, Inc. is the only known source of the Compendex on Engineering Village tool. They are the exclusive licensor and the owner of the Engineering Village service.</p>
<p>The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this requirement:<br />1194.22 - Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications<br />1194.31 - Functional Performance Criteria<br />1194.41 - Information, Documentation, and Support</p>
<p>The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 519120 - Libraries and archives, with a small business size standard of $7 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Elsevier, Inc.<br /><br />It is NIST's belief that Elsevier, Inc. is the sole provider of the Compendex on Engineering Village service. Interested parties that believe they are capable of fulfilling the requirements listed above for NIST, or are authorized by Elsevier, Inc. to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>***THE INTENTION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO NOTIFY INDUSTRY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE THE TELEMETRY SYSTEM WHICH IS PART OF THE PICAYUNE STRAND RESTORATION PROJECT, FAKA UNION PUMPING STATION, THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR THE PICAYUNE STRAND RESTORATION PROJECT, FAKA UNION PUMPING STATION ***<BR><BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit on a Sole Source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the telemetry system of the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Faka Union Pumping Station, which consists of brand name components and accessories for the following items: Ethernet network switches, programmable logic controllers, touch screens, radios, antennas, satellite voice communication system, routers, multiplexers, patch panels, video camera recorder, remote terminal units, solar equipment, alarm collectors, alarm panels, surge protectors, SCADA software, computers, historical servers, and printers. The telemetry system allows many water control structures to be operated and monitored remotely. It will operate 24 hours a day and will be designed to operate during hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. The Faka Union Pumping Station will be part of a much larger system that South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) uses to remotely operate and monitor its structures. The anticipated dollar amount of the Sole Source system is $500,000.00.<BR><BR>The components listed above have been specifically selected due to their performance interoperability as part of an entire telemetry system. Substitution with similar components could present a considerable risk to life and property. The system as a whole provides standardization in training, maintenance, warehousing, and interchangeability during potential life threatening weather events. <BR><BR>The Picayune Strand Restoration Project (PSRP) will restore more than 55,000 acres of land located in southwestern Collier County, Florida to a healthy and functional wetland system. The plan for the Project is to remove the infrastructure of a subdivision and restore its pre-drainage hydrology and ecology, generating positive effects on the hydrology, vegetation, and wildlife of the project area and surrounding public lands. In addition, the existing road network within PSRP will be taken down to grade with a limited portion of the roads remaining above grade.<BR><BR>The plan for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Faka Union Pumping Station, calls for the construction of a pumping station, tie-back levees, spreader cells, and canal plugs to slow water flowing through existing canals and distribute it across the landscape. The Faka Union Pumping Station will have six 470-cfs engine driven pumps and three 100-cfs electrical pumps for a firm capacity of 2650 cfs. <BR><BR>The magnitude of construction of the project is $100,000,000.00-$250,000,000.00. The work is in Collier County, Florida. A solicitation for the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Faka Union Pumping Station will be issued on or about 22 June 2010 with proposals due on or about 5 August 2010.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to the work described in paragraph 1 and respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen calendars days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <BR><BR>Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Pamela Shirley at 904-232-1992 or email at Pamela.J.Shirley@usace.army.mil. <BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS FOR PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake and Dam Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK.  The modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for to: 1)  remove existing windows and doors from the Project Managers Office building and replace with energy efficient windows and doors and 2) renovate the maintenance building by updating the electrical system, furnishing and installing new heaters, replace existing roll up doors with insulated roll up doors, and  re-configure the current maintenance building area to accommodate a 8 x 10 office/mechnical area complete with a heat pump.        <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at the PMO Office and the Maintenance Building.  2) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during the work. <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): AECOM, W9127N-10-D-0002-0008<br><br>Portland District Corps of Engineers intends to issue Task Order number 0008 using recovery act funding to contract number W9127N-10-D-0002 awarded to AECOM for the following procurement:  The Contractor is to characterize dredged material using a modified incremental sampling (IS) approach concurrently with conventional sampling protocols found in the 2009 Sediment Evaluation Framework for the Pacific Northwest (SEF), and to compare the effectiveness and utility of each methodology. IS was originally developed by the mining industry and was studied by the Corps for use at explosives-contaminated sites as a way to minimize sampling and subsampling errors by collecting a large number of closely-spaced surface soil samples that are then composited and submitted to a laboratory as a single sample.  To the best of our knowledge, IS has not been used to characterize dredged material.  The primary goal of IS (as applied to dredged material testing) is to collect equal amounts of material (known as increments) from each core to create a super-composite of material weighing about 1,000 g (wet weight), and then extract and analyze a greater mass of material than what is typically analyzed under the SEF protocol. Results of the analysis shall determine if analyses conducted on a larger subsample pulled from a composite of many cores better represents the true value of the particular analyte(s) in a given unit of material (aka the decision unit).  The Corps has selected Post Office Bar as the study area. Post Office Bar is a shoaling area located within the Federal Navigation Channel (FNC) in the Lower Willamette River (LWR) at river mile 2.1-2.4.  The proposed dredging prism (DP) varies from 2 to 10-feet deep, with approximately 10% sand.

<DESC>The VA Network 2 Contracting Office intends to enter into sole source procurement with Healing Healthcare Systems for the C.A.R.E. Channel.  This proposed contract action is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) which states "When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities", only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect. This procurement is for The C.A.R.E. Channel which will provide healing programming of nature and music for our patients over a designated TV channel.   The C.A.R.E. Channel is the only provider that supplies daytime and nighttime programming which supports the patients' circadian rhythm and has been shown to help those who are confused, disoriented or simply unable to sleep at night.  Healing Healthcare Systems provides 70 hours of program content which better supports the extended care patient.  The program is provided in MPEG2 format at a rate of 8 mgs per second (this provides the highest quality of digital imagery and will accommodate HD distribution.)  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely by the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted. Inquires will only be accepted by email at allen.johnson2@va.gov.

Date:    May 19, 2010

     From:	Michael Bermes , Contract Specialist

Subj:	Scrap Metal Sealed Bid Sale FY ( 595-FY-10-05 )

To:	All Interested Parties

                The Department of Veterans Affairs Lebanon VA Medical Center has accumulated 
                approximately 125 cubic yards of loose fitting scrap metal, file cabinets, gym lockers, 
                office furniture, laundry carts, wheelchair parts and other various pieces of plumbing 
                pipe and fixtures.
 All items are to be sold as SCRAP. The successful bidder will be responsible for the complete removal of all scrap from these areas.  Successful bidder will provide manpower and equipment necessary for the removal of the scrap.  Scrap will be sold - "AS IS -  WHERE IS." The contract will be awarded to that responsible Bidder whose bid conforming to the Invitation will be most advantageous to the Government. Scrap must be weighed and the weight called into the contracting officer. Michael Bermes   TEL:	(717) 228-6018.

You are invited to inspect and submit a bid for this SALE, if interested. Inspections will begin on   May 20, 2010   from 7AM to 11:30 and 12:30 to 3PM Monday thru Friday up to    May 27, 2010    .   All bids must be received by Acquisition & Material Management Service., no later than 4PM EST on     May 28, 2010    , at the following address: Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center Bldg. 18, room 148 (125), Attn: Michael Bermes, 1700 S. Lincoln Avenue, Lebanon, PA 17042.     Late bids will not be accepted. 

All bidders are highly encouraged to view the scrap before submitting a bid. In order to view the scrap you must call Craig Watkins at (717) 272-6621 X 4078 to set up an appointment. 

Successful bidder will be notified by either mail or telephone. Upon being notified he/she must make payment either by a Certified Check or Money Order to the Department of Veterans Affairs Station ( 595 ) - before removal of the scrap. No Personal Checks will be accepted. All scrap must be removed with seven (7) working days from notification by the VA unless otherwise specified.

If, after the award, the Purchaser breaches the contract by failure to make payment within the time allowed by the contract or by failure to remove the property within the time  allowed by the contract, then the Government may send the Purchaser a 7-day written notice of default (calculated from date of notification), and upon Purchaser's failure to cure such default within that period (or such further period as the Contracting Officer may allow) the Purchaser shall lose all right, title, and interest which he/she might otherwise have acquired in and to such property as to which a default has occurred. The Purchaser agrees that in the event he/she fails to pay for the property or remove the same within the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20 percent of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default has occurred, or (b) $25, whichever is greater:
                  Practices that eliminate competition, such as collusive bidding, may warrant criminal, civil, or
                    administrative action against the participant(s) and may be referred to the Department of Justice 
                    in accordance with 41 CFR 101-45.317.1.


NOTE:	Bidders are to be advised that we DO NOT provide personnel or equipment to assist in the removal of the scrap. Also the GOVERNMENT shall not be liable for injuries, damages or any other incidents that should arise.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ)  W911QY-10-T-0022, for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and in conjunction with FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36. <BR>BACKGROUND- The US Army Soldier Systems Center (SSC),  Natick Contracting Division (NCD), has a requirement for a Differential Scanning Colorimeter-Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (DSC-TGA), a specialized piece of equipment to be used for next generation characterization of flame and thermal resistant materials, TA Instruments, Brand Name or Equal.   Part Number 961000.901.  Quantity 1 each.  Ethernet Switch Kit, part number 924500.602, quantity 1 each.  Thermal Installation and Training, part number 999800.528, quantity 1 each.<BR>REQUIREMENTS - The Contractor shall install a simultaneous DSC-TCA which provides concurrent measurement of heat flow and weigh change on the same sample from ambient to 1500C at the Thermal Testing Facility (TTF) at  SSC.  <BR>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - The contractor's primary focus shall be to deliver, install and provide training for the simultaneous DSC-TCA unit.  In order to reduce repair cost and shorten equipment down time, this instrument must be designed and manufactured in the USA.<BR>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - The contractor shall deliver and install Q600 SDT Simultaneous DSC-TGA.<BR>		(1) To minimize weight drift, the DSC-TGA must utilize a two, horizontal, TGA balances mechanism (one for the sample and one for the reference), so that the differential weight loss between the sample and reference is calculated and displayed.  The horizontal design is needed to minimize weight drift due to thermal expansion and the buoyancy effects of the purge gas.<BR>            (2) When two empty crucibles are scanned, the raw, uncorrected baseline drift must be less 10 micrograms up to 1000oC, and less than 50 micrograms at 1500oC.  No software is allowed for the baseline subtraction and correction.<BR>		(3) The TGA must be capable of weighing the sample, and automatically storing the sample weight.  No separate weighing of a TGA sample using an external, analytical balance is allowed. <BR>		(4) The TGA sensitivity of 0.1 micrograms is needed for detection of weak transitions.  <BR>		(5) The DSC sensitivity should be 4 microwatts.<BR>		(6) Heat flow axis must be calibrated using sapphire as the calibrant over the temperature range from ambient to 1500 C.<BR>		(7) Efficient furnace cooling is required for sample throughput.  The instrument must cool from 1500C to 50C in less than 30 minutes.<BR>		(8) The DSC-TGA must come with software for instrument control (to tare, start, and modify or stop a run in progress).  The software should provide the ability to plot and do data analysis. <BR>		(9) The contractor shall provide installation, calibration, and include a one-year warranty.<BR>DELIVERABLES:   The contractor shall deliver and install the DSC-TGA instrument.  The installation shall include calibration with a traceable standard and a certificate of calibration.  Basic training shall be provided to familiarize the users with the equipment after installation.  A one-year warranty will be provided.<BR>PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: <BR>		a. General Experience.

Also, please carefully read FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Acquisition.  <BR>Government will evaluate the Offerors capability accordingly.  Offerors are advised to ask the contracting officer for clarification of any part of these instructions that they do not understand.<BR>CLASSIFIED DATA-  No classified data shall appear in the proposal and shall not be submitted electronically.  Should an Offeror believe a need exists to provide classified information to support their proposal, separate instructions will be provided for submission of classified information in the solicitation.

Offerors shall submit a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000, unless a completed copy of these provisions is available online at ORCA.<BR><BR> FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) - <BR><BR>The Government will award one contract as a result of this solicitation, but reserves the right to award no contracts, if no offers are found to be acceptable for award.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical capability of offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; (iii) price/cost (see FAR 15.304)  Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important when compared to price.   A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees. <BR><BR>Factors to be Evaluated:  Factor 1 Technical Approach.  Factor 2 Past Performance.<BR>Factor 3 Price <BR><BR>The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is as follows: Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR>PHASE I -  The non-price factors will be evaluated to support best-value trade-off process for the two non-price factors. The non-price factors will be assigned an adjective rating, and proposals with an adjective rating of acceptable or be will no be considered for award.  The following adjective ratings will be assigned to the offerors technical and past performance portion of the proposal:<BR>EXCELLENT -The prototype has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the prototype provides strengths which are supported in the written technical proposal. The technical factors are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR>GOOD -  The technical proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements.  Past performance indicates little doubt that the offeror perform the required effort.  <BR>ACCEPTABLE- The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their past performance record.<BR>MARGINAL - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record.<BR>UNACCEPTABLE - The technical proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their performance record<BR>In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the down-selected proposals. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Economic Quantity Discount and revised pricing will be taken into consideration in Phase II. Each down-selected proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>9.

The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract.

CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority. The products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment. The rationale for this brand name only justification is based on several factors. A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any given product. While there are competing products that thave similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable. The cost in training, experience and project delay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government.A search of the internet and technical documents was done to obtain a list of vendors that produced enterprise server based products to fulfill these requirements. It was determined during this evaluation that AdLib Softwer product was the best fit for answering all applicable SMART requirements.<BR><BR>The AdLib product continues to be the best fit for SMART, not only because the program is currently leveraging the product, but also for the following reasons: - ITCCB: As SMART moves towared full deployment, all the products that make up the messaging core must receive approval from the ITCCB, IA, and DS. By limiting the number of new and/or unknown applications, this approval process will be more efficient. - Ease of Use: One of the goals of SMART's initial evaluation was to find a product that not only met all appplicable requirements, but was also easy to install, ocnfigure and use. -Scalability: Licensing of the AdLib product allows the program to add additional cnversion servers as SMART's needs to meet processing demand withoug having to purchase an abundance of additional licenses.<BR><BR>

<p>PROJECT TITLE:<br />The title of this project is "LEASE OF FIVE (5) EXECUTIVE VEHICLES"</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WORK:<br />Annual lease of up to three (3) Class-IV, full-size sedans, one (1) sport utility vehicle, and one (1) Lincoln Town Car (Signature Series), all with the minimum specification requirements as set forth in the description, specification, and work statement.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVE:<br />The objective of this contract is to lease up to three (3) new, full-size, (Class IV) sedans, one (1) sport utility vehicle, and one (1) Lincoln Town Car (Signature Series), (hereafter referred to as vehicles), on an annual basis for an estimated period of four years (an initial base year with three additional one-year option periods).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:<br />The Contractor shall lease to the Government, up to five (5) vehicles at the firm fixed prices set forth in the contract. All vehicles provided by the Contractor during the period of performance of this contract, or any extension, shall have the minimum specifications as set forth below.</p>
<p>In addition to the initial base year, there are three (3) option years under this contract as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Government shall have the option to lease up to five (5) vehicles, for a first option year, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth in the contract. Should the Government elect to exercise its option for the first option year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the base year of the contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Government shall have the option to lease up to five (5) vehicles, for a second option year, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth in the contract. Should the Government elect to exercise its option for the second option year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Government shall have the option to lease up to five (5) vehicles, for a third option year, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth in the contract. Should the Government elect to exercise its option for the third option year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract.</p>
<p>(4) The Government shall have the option to exchange to another type of vehicle with at least 30-days notification to the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the vehicles available for pickup by the NRC at the Contractor's facility in any location within the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. The vehicles shall be available for the Government's pickup on the delivery schedule date as set forth in the contract, which at such time, the term of the initial base year (1st-year) lease shall begin.</p>
<p>The vehicles will be garaged at NRC's headquarters, located at the One White Flint North Building, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852.</p>
<p>NRC is exempt from the requirement to display official U.S. Government license tags and other identification. The Contractor shall therefore furnish all required tags from the State of Maryland for the vehicles prior to the Government's pickup of the vehicles.</p>
<p>The Government may install telephones and reading lamps in each of the leased vehicles and will remove this equipment from the vehicles upon expiration of the contract.</p>
<p>WARRANTY:<br />The manufacturer's standard warranty for the leased vehicles shall cover the entire period under this contract or any extension. Any towing that may be required for warranty service shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>MAINTENANCE:<br />The Contractor shall perform all routine maintenance on the leased vehicles in accordance with the maintenance schedule recommended by the manufacturer (i.e. oil and oil filter changes, lubrication, tire rotation, fluid replenishment, etc.).</p>
<p>RETURN OF VEHICLES:<br />At least 30-days prior to the expiration or termination of this contract, the Government will contact the Contractor to determine a destination within the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. area mutually agreeable to both parties for the return of the vehicles.</p>
<p>The Government will return the vehicles to the Contractor at the mutually agreed delivery destination, not later than five work days after expiration or termination of the contract period for the vehicles.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for performing an appraisal of the physical condition of each vehicle returned by the Government, prior to that vehicle being released from the Government's custody, and shall furnish the Government with a copy of the appraisal upon its completion. The Government shall not be responsible for any damage not listed on the appraisal report.</p>
<p>The Government will assume full responsibility for reconditioning the vehicles at its expense, excluding normal wear and tear as defined below:</p>
<p>For purposes of this contract lease, "normal wear and tear" is defined as those dents, dings, paint chips, scratches, pitted but not cracked windshields, and interior wear such as soiled carpets and seats, normally occurring to a motor vehicle over the contract period of use, in both a rural and metropolitan area. In any event, the Government's liability for any reconditioning of the vehicles shall be limited to replacement of glass and exterior trim, and repair to body damage attributable to collision only, and to interior damage such as cut, torn, burnt materials, as well as mechanical repair. Contractors are cautioned that the Government, by signing the damage estimate, does not acknowledge liability therefore. This can only be accomplished by an authorized NRC Contracting Officer after evaluation and consideration of all factors.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />This contract shall consist of a one-year base period with three (3) additional one-year option periods (total of four years). It is estimated that the initial one-year base period would begin on October 1, 2010.</p>

<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of&not;name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>E.8 FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(Tailored)</p>
<p>a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Management Approach - Qualifications</p>
<p>Element 1.1 - Authorized/Certified Reseller and Servicing Agent by OEM.</p>
<p>Element 1.2 - Key Personnel Qualifications.</p>
<p>Element 1.3 - Personnel Qualifications.<br />Element 1.4 - Global Reach. <br />Factor 2: Technical Approach</p>
<p>Element 2.1 - Evaluation of Sample Scenarios.</p>
<p>Element 2.2 - Capabilities and Features.</p>
<p>Element 2.3 - Warranty and Support.</p>
<p>Element 2.4 - Government/Commercial Standards.</p>
<p>Element 2.5 - Flexibility and Scalability.</p>
<p>Element 2.6 - CPE and User Stations.</p>
<p>Element 2.7 - Information System Security and Information Assurance.</p>
<p>Element 2.8 - Survivability and Recovery.</p>
<p>Element 2.9 - Leverage existing Assets.<br /><br />Factor 3 - Business Approach<br />Element 3.1 - Partnerships and Teaming Agreements.</p>
<p>Element 3.2 - Sub-Contracting Plan.</p>
<p>Element 3.3 - Delivery of Services. <br />Factor 4 - Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 5 - Price</p>
<p>Management Approach, Technical Approach, Business Approach and Relevant Past Performance are not listed in descending order of importance but are considered equal, and when combined, are more important than price. As technical scores converge, the price grows more importance in making the award selection. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>&bull; Best Value Determination Methodology- After each proposal is evaluated and rated using the methodologies described in the foregoing the Government will perform a best value determination featuring price/non-price trade-offs. In the relationship of non-price factors and price factors, contractors are advised that overall cost/price of performance will not be considered as controlling.</p>
<p>In order to determine which Offeror's proposal represents the best overall expected value, the USCG will evaluate and rate the quality and responsiveness of each Offeror's non-price proposal volumes as described in the foregoing.</p>
<p>The price proposal will then be evaluated. If the Offeror with the highest non-price factors composite rating also has the lowest price, then that Offeror will be considered best overall value. However, in the event non-price factors evaluations result in two or more substantially equally highly rated proposals, overall evaluated cost/price will be a major factor in selection of a proposal for award. In the event non-price factor evaluations result in multiple acceptable technical proposals with significant differences in composite non-price rating, overall cost/price differences will be considered and could become the determining factor in the Government's decision as to whether the difference in expected value is worth the higher price to the Government.</p>
<p>b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />E.7 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND RELEVANT IMPORTANCE <br />The following criteria will be used in the evaluation of proposals:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Management Approach - Qualifications</p>
<p>Under this factor, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed management approach in terms of the organizational structure, allocation of roles and responsibilities, qualification of personnel, and the degree to which the Offeror's program management team is empowered to assign and expend corporate resources to resolve issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 1.1 - Authorized/Certified Reseller and Servicing Agent by OEM. Degree to which the small business is an authorized/certified reseller and servicing agent by the Original Equipment Manufacturer for the quoted Telephony/UC solution.

<p>&bull; Element 1.3 - Personnel Qualifications. Degree to which sufficient number of qualified personnel are available to meet SOW requirements (e.g. installers, testers, systems specialists/engineers, technicians, etc.).<br />&bull; Element 1.4 - Global Reach. Degree to which the Offeror has the capacity to provide services at USCG units (ashore and afloat) at world-wide Coast Guard locations.<br />Factor 2: Technical Approach</p>
<p>Under this factor, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's technical approach to meet SOW requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.1 - Evaluation of Sample Scenarios. For each of the 4 sample scenarios in the RFP, the degree to which the Offeror's proposed solution meets USCG SOW requirements, demonstrates a thorough understanding of design and technical needs, and includes a sound and realistic approach for installation operation, training, and support.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.2 - Capabilities and Features. Degree to which the Offeror's proposed solution supports the system-based telephony requirements outlined in the USCG SOW, including JITC certification, capabilities/features, and ancillary devices.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.3 - Warranty and Support. The degree to which the Offeror's proposed solution meets the warranty and technical support requirements outlined in the USCG SOW.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.4 - Government/Commercial Standards. Degree to which the Offeror's technical solutions are based upon government, commercial and industry standards rather than proprietary standards. Degree to which the Offeror's enterprise solution does not require redesign, modification, or unique components or interfaces to meet the USCG SOW.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.5 - Flexibility and Scalability. Degree to which the Offeror's proposed technical solution has the flexibility and scalability to accommodate growth, evolution, and changes in geographic requirements for services. Degree to which that enterprise architecture mitigates the impact to users when new CPE and telephony services are introduced.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.6 - CPE and User Stations. Degree to which the Offeror's CPE and user station functionality, capacity and interfaces are consistent with the requirements outlined in the USCG SOW.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.7 - Information System Security and Information Assurance. The degree to which the offerer demonstrates an understanding and ability to comply with all applicable ISS/IA requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.8 - Survivability and Recovery. Degree to which the Offeror's solution is able to mitigate the effects of a widespread system failures and provide service during COOP and/or disaster recovery. Degree to which the Offeror's Enterprise solution can ensure continuity of service in the event of a failure.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 2.9 - Leverage existing Assets - Degree to which the Offeror's proposed technical solution can leverage existing USCG information technology infrastructure to optimize resources and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Factor 3: - Business Approach<br />Under this factor, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed business approach and the degree to which it facilitates the ability to meet USCG SOW requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 3.1 - Partnerships and Teaming Agreements. If the Offeror's proposal includes any partnerships or teaming agreements, a description of the scope and circumstances, and the degree to which they meet USCG SOW requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 3.2 - Sub-Contracting Plan. The degree to which the Offeror's proposal describes the circumstances and plan for delivering materials and/or services via sub-contracting arrangement to meet USCG SOW requirements.<br />&bull; Element 3.3 - Delivery of Services. The degree to which the Offeror's proposal describes the circumstances and plan for delivering each of the services described in Section 6.3 of the USCG SOW.<br />Factor 4: Relevant Past Performance</p>
<p>Degree to which the Offeror has demonstrated successful relevant experience in the planning and execution of contract/delivery orders of similar scope, complexity, type, and schedule. All information and references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team.<br />Factor 5: Price</p>
<p>Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for labor and materials. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements will be disqualified.<br />&bull; Element 4.1 - Price Reasonableness. The Evaluation Team will compare the Offerer's proposal against relevant price lists and/or catalogs for materials and services and through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation to assess price reasonableness.</p>
<p>&bull; Element 4.2 - Price Realism. Offeror's proposals will be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar services and equipment that have been procured during the last five years as well as labor rates from GSA Schedules.</p>
<p>The price evaluation of proposals will take into account the Offeror's submitted Total Evaluated Discounted Price as calculated using the price tables. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all option periods to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of separately priced line items and option periods shall not obligate the Government to purchase separately priced line items or exercise the option periods. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardee's proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>To corroborate the accuracy of the stated discounts for supplies the Offeror should submit copies of relevant commercial price lists and/or catalogs for those items. The offered discounted prices will be compared and evaluated for realism against these catalog list prices.</p>
<p>In the case of services, the Offeror's Price Volumes should demonstrate that the prices proposed for services are consistent with prices charged for similar services under previous contracts. To corroborate the accuracy of the stated discounts for services the Offeror should submit copies of relevant commercial price lists and/or catalogs for those items or provide sufficient information from previous contracts for similar services to show the offered prices are consistent with, or lower than, the price offered on those previous contracts. The offered prices for services will be compared and evaluated for realism against the provided catalog list prices and/or previous contract prices for similar services.<br /><br />Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price, inclusive of option periods, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. Prices determined to be unrealistic as described herein may be considered weaknesses/risk factors in the evaluation ratings of non-price factors (management approach, technical approach and/or business approach).</p>
<p>Management Approach, Technical Approach, Business Approach and Relevant Past Performance are not listed in descending order of importance but are equal, and when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;E.8 BASIS FOR AWARD - TRADE-OFF SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS <br />The Government will award a contract, on an all or none basis, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered. Prospective offerors are advised that in consideration of <br />Best Value a proposal meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced offeror is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>E.9 FAR 52.233-2 Service of Protest (SEP 2006)(Tailored)</p>
<p>(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed <br />directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government <br />Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) <br />by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

<p>(1) ____Are, ____are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2)____Have, _____have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>

<p>(4) _______Have, _____have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300038 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value. The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.

<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for unusually damaged items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br />Award will be made to the offeror proposing the best value to the Government considering in the above order of precedence. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combine synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;&nbsp;quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Solicitation No. HSCG32-10-Q-E04088 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-41. This solicitation is set-aside 100% small business and the associated NAICS code is 532411 and small business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The contractor shall furnish a hopper barge and services to the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC), as part of the Barge Ballast Water Working Group, who intends to conduct experiments to determine whether eggs, larvae, and fry of Asian carp can be drawn into barge tanks and survive there. The contractor shall provide a firm fixed price proposal.<br />Barge Experiments: Entrainment of Carp into Tanks<br />Background: As Asian carp migrate closer to the Army Corps of Engineers fish dispersal barrier located in the Chicago Shipping and Sanitary Canal (CSSC), there is a concern that eggs, larvae, and fry in tanks on barges and towboats could be transported over the barrier and released upstream. As a result of this concern, the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC), as part of the Barge Ballast Water Working Group, intends to conduct experiments to determine whether eggs, larvae, and fry of Asian carp can be drawn into barge tanks and survive there. RDC will contract with an independent contractor to conduct several experiments aboard barges and towboats.<br />Experiments will include modifying a barge ballast tank with a through-hull valve assembly(ies) with remote actuators to allow river water to enter the ballast tank. The modified barge will be positioned in the CSSC or in another area known to have Asian carp. The valve will be opened to allow approximately 80 cubic meters (~ 17,600 gallons) of water into the tank. Using a trash pump, the water will then be pumped out through a 55 micrometer net and discharged in the same area where the water was taken aboard. <br />A second set of experiments will involve pumping river water into the barge tanks and securing mesh cages containing small fish and fry in the tanks. The mesh enclosures will be retrieved after timed exposures within the tanks to determine the likelihood of survival during normal barging operations. <br />Upon completion of all experiments, the valve assembly will be removed and the hull penetration(s) permanently patched to restore the barge to its normal condition. <br />Requirements: The RDC therefore intends to lease a hopper barge and services to:<br />&bull; modify the barge with a through-hull fittings, <br />&bull; confer with RDC and of the Barge Ballast Water Working Group on final development of experimental plans<br />&bull; move and operate the barge to an area with Asian carp <br />&bull; provide trash pump and hoses to empty flooded barge tank<br />&bull; provide access to barge during experiments<br />&bull; provide transportation from shore to barge at sampling location for members of experimental party<br />A licensed commercial towboat operator and appropriate commercial insurance for towboat and barge are required.<br />Timeframe: Use of barge is required for periodic experiments May - August 2010. <br />Location: Sampling experiments will take place at locations between the downstream end of the fish dispersal barrier in the CSSC and downriver as far as Henry, IL. Experiments may take place in area with currents (channels or off channel) or in quiet water (shoreward of channel, harbors or slips). Experiments may take place while moored or underway.<br />The selected offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR&nbsp;52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representative and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Item; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-CommerciaItems, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-33.&nbsp; The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at <a href="http://www.acqnet.gov/far">http://www.acqnet.gov/far</a>.&nbsp;<br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum With The Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest With The Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (GG-913)<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p><br />Closing date/time for submission of quotations is 24 May 2010 at 11:00 AM Pacific time. Ensure that in addition to prices, quotations include applicable representations and certifications and all other information required by above incorporated clauses. Submit responses to SFLC (CPD), Suite 807N, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA Attn: Jake M. Apolonio. Electronic offers submitted via email to jake.m.apolonio@uscg.mil are acceptable and encouraged.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following question:


Question:What is the minimum number of repeated detonations required over the life time of the system?
Answer:50 grams is a requirement for hazard class 1.3/1.4 (i.e. Grenade fuze delay columns) and we expect roughly 200 of these tests per year with an expected life of 5 years before refurbishment or replacement. We will be detonating 200 tests of less then 0.2 gram Hazard Class 1.1 per month. We will also be using this system for 4 tests per year of up to 5 grams Hazard Class 1.1. 


Quoters are required to acknowledge viewing all posted amendments in their quotes, ensuring to list each amendment number.

WORK TO BE PERFORMED:

Statement of WorkMaintenance of Telephone and Associated SystemsNational Park Service - Ellis Island and Liberty Island
1.	INTRODUCTIONThe specifications in this Statement of Work (SOW) cover the maintenance services that must be provided for the National Park Service's telephone and associated systems on Ellis Island and Liberty Island. Each island has its own NEC NEAX2000 IVS PBX, and the two are networked together by CCIS via a T1 link. The telephone systems were originally installed in the summer of 1999. There are no direct outside trunks on the Liberty Island switch; instead the trunks on the Ellis Island switch carry all outside calls. Centralized voice mail and call accounting systems serving both telephone systems also reside on Ellis Island. The voicemail system was upgraded to a NEAX AD-64 in late 2005, and the call accounting system is TAPIT for Windows. All inbound calls to both islands are answered by the Auto-attendant on the AD-64. Component details of each system are given elsewhere in this SOW. Since personnel are on Ellis and Liberty Islands twenty-four hours per day, it is imperative that the telephone and associated systems be kept in good working order, and that malfunctions be dealt with promptly. 2.	SCOPEThe components of the systems listed in this SOW, plus their software and interconnections must be covered by the maintenance services.  This SOW and the contract line items provide for two types of service.  One type of service required is remedial maintenance, why is broken down into two categories of major and minor malfunction.  The primary difference between these two categories is response time.  Major malfunctions require a response time of two to four hours 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Minor malfunctions require a 24 hour response time Monday through Friday during normal business hours which for the purpose of this SOW is determined to be between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00.  The second type of service is to cover routine actions such as equipment moves, additions or changes.  To support these two types of services the contractor will provide pricing under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Remedial maintenance will be provided under a per call pricing with separate pricing for major malfunction calls broken out by; normal duty hours, outside normal duty hours Monday - Friday; and weekends and holidays.  Minor malfunction will have just one pricing structure since it is planned that these will only be required during duty hours.  The government will place an order for 8 hour at the time of award; which will provide the contractor a guaranteed minimum for the contract. 
2.1.	Remedial MaintenanceThe vendor must provide remedial maintenance services, which are defined as maintenance services performed on an unscheduled basis when there is an equipment or software malfunction. Repair or replacement of a malfunctioning component is the responsibility of the vendor.2.1.1.	Service AvailabilityThe vendor's service organization must be reachable and available 24 hours per day, every day of the year, to deal with system malfunctions. The vendor must provide a specific contact telephone number for customer reporting of system problems.2.1.2.	Major MalfunctionA major malfunction is defined as a malfunction that materially affects a system's call processing capability, and includes, but is not limited to:"	the failure of any system feature required for call processing"	a malfunction affecting 10% or more of the stations on Ellis Island or 15% or more of the stations on Liberty Island."	a malfunction affecting 15% or more of the lines in any of the trunk groups on either switch, except that a failure affecting a lesser percentage of lines that materially affects call processing (e.g. the lead number in a hunt group) is also a major malfunction2.1.3.	Minor MalfunctionA minor malfunction is any malfunction not defined as a major malfunction.2.1.4.	Response Times2.1.4.1.	To Major MalfunctionThe vendor must make a best effort to respond within two hours, and in no case greater than four hours to a trouble call placed concerning a major malfunction. It is recognized that there may be some delay in getting onto Ellis Island or Liberty Island. Therefore, depending upon the circumstances and arrangements made, the four hour maximum will be from the time the trouble call was placed to the time the vendor's technician(s) arrive at:"	the guard house (Post 4) to the entrance of the bridge connecting Ellis Island to Liberty State Park, or"	the commercial ferry service at Battery Park, or"	the guard house (MIO) near Battery Park where the National Park Service boats depart2.1.4.2.	To Minor MalfunctionMaximum vendor response time after a trouble call has been placed concerning a minor malfunction must be less than 24 business hours.2.2.	Moves, Additions, and ChangesAt the request of the National Park Service, the vendor must provide labor and materials to effect moves, additions, and changes to the systems. The vendor must provide a rate schedule of labor charges and the days and times at which they apply. This rate schedule must include the charges for on-site labor during and outside normal business hours, as well as for weekends and holidays. In addition, the rate schedule must include the charges for work done through remote access and the days and times at which they apply.2.3.	Technical SupportThe National Park Service currently performs some tasks on the systems relating to administration, moves, additions, and changes. From time to time questions arise while performing these activities. The vendor is expected to cooperate in responding in a timely manner to occasional reasonable requests for information without charge. 
2.4.	Remote AccessThe vendor must have the capability for remotely accessing the PBX's and the voice mail system for diagnostic, maintenance, and administrative purposes. Remote access must be part of the vendor's normal operating procedures with its customers. The Ellis Island and Liberty Island systems are currently configured to allow for remote access.
3.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS3.1.	Authorized DealerThe vendor must maintain status as an authorized NEC dealer and the vendor's technicians must be certified to work on all of the Ellis Island and Liberty Island system components, including the voicemail system.3.2.	Component Provision, Replacement, and UpgradeAll component hardware or software supplied as replacements during remedial maintenance or as part of an upgrade, expansion, or other change must be new standard parts. Components that are no longer manufactured, and for which there are no approved substitutes, may be replaced by refurbished parts so long as they are clean, in good physical condition and function to specification. Replacement components must be of equal or better quality than those being replaced.3.3.	Component AvailabilityThe vendor must stock or have access to all critical components of the systems. These must be kept in locations where they can be quickly and easily obtained when required.3.4.	Escalation ProceduresThe vendor must provide an escalation procedure and contact names and contact numbers that the National Park Service can use in the event that issues arise which cannot be resolved to the National Pak Service's satisfaction in a timely manner by the vendor's service department.3.5.	Laws, Codes and RegulationsAll work and the manner in which it is performed by the vendor must comply with OSHA requirements, the National Electrical Code (2005), and other applicable New York, New Jersey, New York City and federal laws, codes and regulations.3.6.	SecurityThe vendor must operate within the physical and data security rules of the National Park Service or other authorities having jurisdiction.3.7.	SafetyWith regard to work being performed, the vendor must take all necessary safety and health precautions and warnings required to protect its workers, the public, and the property of others.3.8.	Performance and ConductThe vendor must perform all work in a skillful and professional manner in accordance with standards and practices documented and/or accepted by industry or otherwise specified herein.3.9.	SubcontractorsThe vendor must be responsible for any work done by its subcontractors. The vendor must also be responsible for ensuring that its subcontractors comply with all applicable health, safety and security laws, codes, and regulations.3.10.	Sensitivity to Historical and Site EnvironmentAll activities on Ellis Island and Liberty Island must take into account the historical and site specific environment in which work will be preformed. Work that entails the construction of facilities must be in consonance with this requirement. 4.	CURRENT CONFIGURATION4.1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-10-Q-8041) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40 (Effective 22 APR 2010).
DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order.  Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Security Boat refurbishment for two (2) 25' BOOMIN' BEAVER TUG BOATS (BB-2 and BB-5); CLIN 0002: refurbish two (2) 36' ALUMINUM MOOSE BOATS (PROWLER I AND PROWLER II); CLIN 0003: refurbish two (2) 28' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (BP-313 AND BP-316); CLIN 0004: refurbish two (2) 27' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (PATROL 3 AND PATROL 5); CLIN 0005: refurbish one (1) 24' ALUMINUM MONARK BOAT (SCI-2); and CLIN 0006: refurbish one (1) 5.4 METER FIBERGLASS WILLARD RHIB (SCI-3). Period of performance: 05/27/2010 through 11/16/2010.  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work.  PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  
Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.  52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism of the proposed price.  A contract price is realistic if it is high enough to preclude the contractor from enduring a significant financial loss in performing the requirements of the contract.  Unrealistically low prices increase performance risk to the Government.  The risk to the Government is that the contractor-to cut its losses-might: cut corners on product quality; deliver late; default, forcing a time-consuming reprocurement; or refuse to deal with the Government in the future or be forced out of business entirely.  The Government will base its evaluation of price realism on a comparison of a quoter's proposed price to other proposed prices received in response to this solicitation and the independent Government estimate.  Prices will be rated either realistic or unrealistically low.
Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a quoter has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Quoter's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the quoter's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.  Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.  The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3.  More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.  Quoters who've completed ORCA should notify the contract specialist before solicitation's closing date and time so it can be downloaded by the procuring contracting office.  The full text of FAR and DFAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/index.htm, respectively.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-10-Q-8041) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40 (Effective 22 APR 2010).
DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order.  Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Security Boat refurbishment for two (2) 25' BOOMIN' BEAVER TUG BOATS (BB-2 and BB-5); CLIN 0002: refurbish two (2) 36' ALUMINUM MOOSE BOATS (PROWLER I AND PROWLER II); CLIN 0003: refurbish two (2) 28' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (BP-313 AND BP-316); CLIN 0004: refurbish two (2) 27' ALUMINUM DAUNTLESS SEAARK BOATS (PATROL 3 AND PATROL 5); CLIN 0005: refurbish one (1) 24' ALUMINUM MONARK BOAT (SCI-2); and CLIN 0006: refurbish one (1) 5.4 METER FIBERGLASS WILLARD RHIB (SCI-3). Period of performance: 05/27/2010 through 11/16/2010.  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work.  PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage.  DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work.  
Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government.  52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism of the proposed price.  A contract price is realistic if it is high enough to preclude the contractor from enduring a significant financial loss in performing the requirements of the contract.  Unrealistically low prices increase performance risk to the Government.  The risk to the Government is that the contractor-to cut its losses-might: cut corners on product quality; deliver late; default, forcing a time-consuming reprocurement; or refuse to deal with the Government in the future or be forced out of business entirely.  The Government will base its evaluation of price realism on a comparison of a quoter's proposed price to other proposed prices received in response to this solicitation and the independent Government estimate.  Prices will be rated either realistic or unrealistically low.
Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a quoter has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an quoter's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the quoter's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance.

<p><br />Description/Work Statement</p>
<p>Background and Need<br />HIV incidence is defined as the rate at which new HIV infections occur, per unit of time. In contrast, HIV prevalence is defined as the proportion of persons infected with HIV or testing HIV positive at a single point in time. Whereas HIV prevalence is a measure of the burden of disease in a population at a given time, HIV incidence indicates the extent to which transmission of the virus is occurring over a defined period (e.g. a year). It is therefore the crucial epidemiological indicator of both the need for preventive interventions, and of their outcome.</p>
<p>A variety of laboratory assays have been developed to estimate HIV incidence using cross-sectional data. The advantage of these assays is that their use does not require following participants longitudinally nor collecting serial blood samples, but rather can be used on one blood sample collected at one point in time.</p>
<p>The BED capture enzyme immunoassay (hereafter termed the BED assay) measures the increasing proportion of HIV-1 IgG to total IgG after seroconversion to estimate HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional settings. In 2005, the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modeling and Projections issued a statement in response to preliminary data on the application of the BED-CEIA in HIV surveillance settings and selected validation studies which demonstrated that the assay overestimated HIV-1 incidence by misclassifying a number of individuals with long-term infection as recent infection in cross-sectional settings. This misclassification effect is particularly severe in settings with high HIV prevalence and may vary by HIV-1 subtype. UNAIDS called for further validation of the assay to improve specificity.<br /><br />The recommended design for incidence assay validation is the application of the assay in cohorts of persons at risk for HIV infection, with additional follow-up of HIV positive persons, for at least one year or twice the length of the window period of the assay. This design enables the comparison of HIV incidence estimated by the assay at various cross-sectional time points after enrollment against directly observed incidence. Additionally this design enables one to quantify the proportion of persons known to be infected for longer than 1 year (false-recent rate). When this design cannot be conducted, the incidence assay can also be applied to a large cross-sectional sample of HIV-infected specimens from persons who had their prior HIV-positive test &ge; 1 year ago and who are not on treatment, to determine the proportion that misclassify as a recent infection on the assay. Care should be taken to ensure that the validation sample is representative of the non-recently infected individuals in the population in which the incidence survey will ultimately be carried out. At the minimum, the validation sample should have data on ART use, AIDS status, and HIV testing history to distinguish between true long-term infections and recent infections in the sample. Further, the validation sample should be appropriately powered in order to estimate the false-recent rate with an acceptable level of precision. The resulting false-recent rate from these validation studies can then be used to calibrate the incidence estimate for an improved estimate in the population of interest.</p>
<p><br />Project Objective <br />The primary objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>&bull; To determine the proportion of samples from individuals in select populations in Eastern and Southern Africa with known HIV positive status of greater than 12 months that misclassify as recent infection on the assay (otherwise known as the "false-recent" rate). <br />&bull; To estimate assay-derived incidence using the observed false-recent rate in similar cross-sectional sites in Eastern and Southern Africa where the incidence assay(s) have been or will be applied.<br />&bull; To compare assay-derived incidence to other measures of incidence in the same population.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work <br />There are ongoing cohort studies for HIV incidence in multiple sites in Africa to identify candidate sites for HIV prevention research among populations at risk for HIV infection. We propose to integrate incidence assay validation studies within these cohorts, particularly those in Eastern and Southern Africa for settings where false-recent rates have not been established (e.g. Ethiopia and Mozambique) but where assay-based incidence surveys have been conducted or currently being planned. Validation studies will: 1) quantify the level of misclassification among HIV-infected persons with &gt; 12 months of infection on the various assays; 2) estimate assay-derived incidence in cross-sectional sites that are representative to the sample in which the false-recent rate is derived; 3) compare assay-based incidence to other measures of incidence (e.g. comparisons against directly observed incidence, other assays).</p>
<p><br />Technical Requirements <br />Task 1: Conduct a false recent calibration study for HIV-1 incidence assays to determine the percentage of false recent samples from individuals with known HIV positive status of greater than 12 month duration</p>
<p>&bull; Develop protocol incorporating a false recent calibration study at the site<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data collection <br />&bull; Assist local laboratory staff to conduct incidence assay testing on entire sample of known long-term infections using:<br />o BED capture enzyme immunoassay<br />o New developmental assays (such as: the rIDR-M avidity index assay, the rIDR-M limiting antigen avidity assay, and the rapid incidence prevalence assay).<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data analysis, including development of the local false-recent rate for HIV-1 incidence assays<br />&bull; Assist local staff to develop a draft report on findings</p>
<p>Task 2: Estimate assay-derived incidence in a cross-sectional sample of HIV-infected persons at the study site and, where possible, compare to other measures of incidence (e.g. directly observed cohort incidence). <br />&bull; Develop protocol incorporating incidence estimation in a cross-sectional samples at the site or proxy population<br />&bull; Assist local laboratory staff to conduct incidence assay testing on a cross-sectional samples at the site or proxy populations using:<br />o BED capture enzyme immunoassay<br />o New developmental assays (such as: the rIDR-M avidity index assay, the rIDR-M limiting antigen avidity assay, and the rapid incidence prevalence assay)<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data analysis for incidence estimation<br />&bull; Assist local staff to develop a draft report on findings</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions that have been received, extend the due date for white papers, and modify the attachment to provide equipment specifications and delete the Non-Government Evaluators paragraph.
All questions shall be directed to Stacey Palivoda, at stacey.palivoda@navy.mil by 12:00 pm Eastern Time on 21 May 2010.
Question 1 - On the FBO Site, the response date as 12 noon, May 24, 2010 for the white paper. In the BAA solicitation, it states the BAA is valid until 12:00 pm on May 21, 2010.  Please clarify the date the response is due to the Navy.
Answer 1 - White paper response due date is extended to 12:00 pm Eastern Time 28 May 2010.
Question 2 - Primary Battery Power - Are you seeking a PPS that is battery agnostic on the input side (designed for multiple battery models, non-rechargeable and rechargeable)? 
Answer 2 - Yes
Question 3 - Legacy Gear - Are you expecting the legacy equipment to be modified with reengineered charging caps, back planes, and physical modification of the already certified tactical electronics by the Contractor to allow for the requested internal recharging while in place on the weapons?  
Answer 3 - No 
Question 4 - Can the removal and mobile recharging of the batteries from weapon mounted electronics be considered?  
Answer 4 - Yes, for weapon mounted devices the removal of batteries for recharging can be considered.  Question 5 - Is the universal output supposed to auto-recognize each squad power device in inventory? Answer 5 - Yes.
Question 6 - Should the Universal Output connection on the output side of the PPS be a common connector? 
Answer 6 - Yes, and the concept should address the specific cabling/interfaces with each squad battery powered device.
Question 7 - MANPACK Considerations - Does the Government want to charge a MANPACK radio battery with another external MANPACK radio battery run through the PPS? 
Answer 7 - The PPS should have the utility to power all squad battery-operated devices whether or not a particular configuration is optimum.  The PPS may be used in emergency situations to provide temporary power to a device whose battery has drained regardless of efficiency.  The PPS may be connected to vehicle power to power and or recharge squad devices. 
Question 8 - On page 8 (Part IV, Sect 1) of the BAA it mentions 'the objectives of the proposed effort'. Is this the objective of the 'Full Proposal' or objectives of developing the system (ie. what the system will be capable of in-service)
Answer 8 - The "objectives of the proposed effort" is a description of the steps, approaches or processes on how they intend to provide for the applied research, development, and demonstration of a lightweight, wearable power conditioning and distribution interface that will automatically recognize all connected power sources and all battery-operated devices issued to an individual Marine as well as those issued to the rifle squad as a whole.

<DESC>The 354th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100%, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 354th CES mission at Eielson AFB, Alaska. The contract will be comprised of three base contracts to be awarded competively. Individual task(s) order(s) work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be a minimum of $2,000 per call and a maximum of $3,000,000.00 per call. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum for each of the contracts is $10 million per year. The total maximum value of the contract for all three contractors for all three years is $90 million. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and two 12-month option periods. There is a guaranteed minimum of $100k for each awardee.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Construction; Subsection 236 - Construction of Buildings with a size standard $33.5 Million; Subsector 237 - Heavy Construction with a size standard $13 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities) and Subsector 238 - Specialty Trade Contractors - Size standard $14 Million. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos/lead-based paint abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete, masonry, steel, painting, roofing and paving, locations of work will be at Eielson AFB, AK and may include Clear AS, Air Force Recreational site at Birch Lake, or in any of the various exercise and bomb ranges in interior Alaska (the PACIFIC Alaska Range Complex, or PARC). Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code under 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p><br />A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) contracts (three Hub Zone certified business concerns), who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The magnitude of the seed project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br />The seed projects general description is as follows:</p>
<p>The intent of project is to completely renovate the Army Lift Station, Building 2212, during which time the awardee shall provide interim grinding and pumping of sewerage to the Eielson Waste Water Treatment Plant. The Air Force requires a complete and functional design and renovation of this lift station, appropriate for the sub-arctic environment of interior Alaska and that meet all applicable current requirements of all applicable codes. The lift station was originally constructed in 1953 with new equipment installed in 1991. The Army lift station has become outdated and has reached the conclusion of its expected normal duty life. Maintenance issues are becoming more frequent and failure of existing equipment is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Up to three (3) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. Evaluation factors will be defined in the RFP. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project. All future task orders will be competed among contract awardees.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 17 Mar 2009 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />A site visit will be conducted at Eielson AFB, on or around 24 March 2010 (exact date, time and location will be provided in the RFP), for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved with the project and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Any questions must be submitted in writing, please send them by e-mail to both SrA Mark A. Chranowski, mark.chranowski@eielson.af.mil (907-377-0108) and Mr. Jonathan Dittmer, johnathan.dittmer@eielson.af.mil. (907-377-5444). QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN BY PHONE CALL.</p>

BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation by evaluating the following factors:

"	Price
"	Previous Experience
"	Key Personnel
"	Past Performance
"	Percentage of Work Completed by the SDVOSB
                      
Award will be made to an offeror on the basis of the lowest priced proposal meeting the technical acceptability standard. (In accordance with FAR 15.101-2)  The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  Furthermore, if discussions are to be conducted the Government will establish a competitive range.  The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) (2).  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

1.  Technical Acceptability: The Government's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) shall evaluate the offeror's technical proposal on a pass/fail basis. 

2.  Price: Award will be made to the offeror that proposes the lowest price and is determined to be technically acceptable.  


PROPOSAL SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS

Proposals shall be submitted electronically to karen.smith3@va.gov and hard copies sent to the Contracting Officer. See mailing address in Block 8 of the Standard Form 1442. 

Standard Form 1442 with blocks 14 through 20 properly filled-out by the offeror.

PRICE. As a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection, price is the discriminating factor for award among those offers that are technically acceptable. Offers that are not technically acceptable cannot be selected, regardless of price. Price is to be submitted in Block 17 of the Standard Form 1442. 


Documentation of Technical Acceptability: Technical acceptability will be based on the following factors: 





EVALUATION FACTORS

1.  PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE.  Identify the offeror's past and present corporate experience on similar projects constructing a partial below-grade, multi-level , poured and pre-cast concrete parking garage structure  for the Federal Government,  State Government or Private Industry. The qualifying project[s] must also fall within the same magnitude or greater. Provide evidence of  minimum of 1 and maximum of 3 contracts completed or substantially completed (80%) within the last 5 years with the following information:
o	Project Description 
o	Contract Numbers 
o	Contract Values 
o	Location 
o	Type of Contract - Federal, State, Private 
o	Point of Contact (email address and phone number) 
o	Date of the Contract ( for example 12-27-2009 through 2-2-2010)

This factor is distinguishable from past performance evaluations under FAR 15.305(a)(2) which ascertains how well a contractor performed and by virtue of evaluating predecessor companies, key personnel, among other things.  Whereas, this the factor determines whether the offeror has performed similar work.  The assessment of this factor is based on corporate experience rather than the experience of key personnel.

2.  KEY PERSONNEL.  Identify the person(s)   Superintendent, Safety Manager, and QA manager). Provide evidence (i.e. resume) of the following:
"	Superintendent must have a minimum of 3 years of experience. Identify experience managing or supervising projects of similar size and scope.  Provide evidence that superintendent has experience managing subcontractors.

In accordance with the clause below.  The superintendent must be an employee of the Prime/General Contractor.  The Government has not privity of contract with any subcontractor and therefore, cannot consider the subcontractor's employee as having authority to act for the Prime Contractor.

52.236-6 Superintendence by the Contractor. (Apr 1984)
At all times during performance of this contract and until the work is completed and accepted, the Contractor shall directly superintend the work or assign and have on the worksite a competent superintendent who is satisfactory to the Contracting Officer and has authority to act for the Contractor.
 			(End of Clause)

If the person you are offering to be the superintendent is not a current employee of your company but intends to become one upon award of the contract, you must submit a letter of commitment from that person (signed by potential superintendent) to prove you will be hiring him/her and he/she intends to accept that position.

"	Safety Manager must have a minimum of three (3) years of experience.  Resume shall include a listing of projects of similar size and scope on which this person was the safety/inspector.

"	Quality Control Manager must have a minimum of three (3) years of experience as a superintendent, inspector, QC manager, project manager, or construction manager, on similar size and type construction contracts which included the major trades that are part of this solicitation.

3.  PAST PERFORMANCE.  Offerors are required to demonstrate recent (within the last five years), successful performance under contracts (ongoing or completed) which are similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the subject requirement. The proposal shall include:

a.	Government Agency/Company which awarded contract to offeror
b.	Contract Number
c.	Description of Contract Scope
d.	Total Dollar Value
e.	Performance Period
f.	Place of Performance
g.	Contracting Officer/Procurement Official
1.	Name
2.	Email
3.	Phone Number
4.	Address

Offeror Past Performance - The offeror's response to this factor will be evaluated as to its relevance and similarity to work under this project.  The Government may contact the offeror's references for information and may review performance ratings on file for prior Government projects the offeror has performed.  Past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror may be used.  All relevant facts and circumstances gathered from information from the offeror's listed references and other sources of information available to the Government (e.g., National Institutes of Health [NIH] Contractor Performance System [CPS] and Past Performance Information Retrieval System [PPIRS]) will be used to evaluate the offeror's overall past performance and quality of performance. If an offeror has not commented on negative past performance evaluations obtained by the TEB the offeror may be given the opportunity to clarify and/or mitigate adverse past performance during "exchanges" (clarifications, communications, or discussions) after receipt of proposals (FAR 15.306).  If discussions are required, and past performance issues remain, these issues will be addressed during discussions.

Offerors who do not have relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (neither favorable nor unfavorable) (FAR 15.305)(a)(iv).




4.	PERCENTAGE OF WORK COMPLETED BY THE SDVOSB.

Offer must provide a percentage breakdown of the labor costs to be performed on the contract.  Specifically, the offeror must indicate the percentage of work to be performed by the SDVOSB prime contractor, any SDVOSB sub-contractor and all other sub-contractors.  This is a mandatory requirement; it should not exceed tow pages.  (See FAR 52.219-14 and VA Notice of Total Service-Disable Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside)

The Prime any major subcontractor should be small businesses; otherwise the Prime runs the risk of violating SBA's Ostensible Subcontractor Rule.  The VA has recently been provided the following guidance by SBA "under the terms of 13 CFR $121.103(h)(4), a contractor and its ostensible subcontractor are treated as joint venturers for size determination purposes.  That section contains certain exclusions for joint venturers.  The applicable provision is contained 13 CFR $121.103(h)(3)(i).  That section provided that a joint venture may submit a proposal as a small business "without regard to affiliation ... so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.

 4.3  52.219-28  POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)
 
   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-
 
   Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.
 
   Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.
 
   (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:
 
     (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.
 
     (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.
 
     (3) For long-term contracts-
 
       (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and
 
       (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.
 
   (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.
 
   (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.
 
   (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.
 
   (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.
 
   (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:
 
   The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 238120 assigned to contract number .
 
 [Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].
 
                            (End of Clause)

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to questions submitted by prospective offerors:<BR><BR>1. What are the projected number of staff months for this project?<BR><BR>ARI doesnt calculate staff months, but the Contractor Manpower Equivalent is approximately .95.<BR><BR>2. Just to clarify, the Influence and Negotiation Training is an in-class course, correct? As opposed to computer-based, mobile, or distributed training.<BR><BR>Yes, classroom based, instructor led would be preferred. However, elegant and wise use of computer-based simulations, etc, would not be out of order, keeping in mind a limited budget and lessening of returns on 'bang for buck' sometimes involved in the use of technology.<BR><BR>3. What do you have in mind for delivering the train-the-trainer feedback system? Can this be a computer-based or a combo of computer and paper-based (i.e., to take out to the field exercises)<BR><BR>The deliverable would most likely be a checklist or other tool for the Trainer/Mentor and Soldier to go through together after a Leader Engagement (practice negotiation) with a role-player.  The assumption is that there would be <BR>some training for the T/Ms on the use of the underlying negotiations framework, language, etc.  <BR><BR>4. How much time delay do you think is feasible between test and evaluation of training/debriefing effectiveness? i.e.,considering JRTC exercise schedules within the constraints of 18 months.<BR><BR>This will be up to the contractors to work quickly and efficiently in order to have their deliverables ready by the 18 month time limit.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact: Clint Boyle, AFRL/PKMP, (505)853-3161. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Entergy directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) to Center for High Technology Materials (CHTM), University of New Mexico, Albuquerque NM. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the relationship between laser pulse duration and damage to the Indium-Antimonide (InSb) semiconductor material.<br />InSb samples are subjected to incident laser pulses of varying pulse width and energy. At a sufficient energy level damage will occur in the InSb crystal lattice. If the pulse duration is longer than 100ps it is expected that material melting will occur as the energy is transferred from energized electrons into the surrounding crystal lattice. In contrast, short laser pulses will directly ablate InSb atoms on time scales much faster than thermal diffusion. AFRL (KAFB) does not possess a sub-picosecond pulsed laser at 1064nm wavelength. And AFRL does not have sufficient capabilities to analyze these samples for damage. The tools required are optical microscopes, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <br />In this project the contractor will subject AFRL supplied InSb samples to sub-picosecond laser pulses. Then the contractor will analyze these samples for damage. In addition the contractor will analyzed AFRL supplied previously damaged InSb samples for comparison. The effort will take place in two phases.<br />A. First task.<br />The contractor shall subject InSb samples to pulsed laser energy. The laser will possess a wavelength of 1064nm, be able to produce pulses less than or equal to 100 fs, and be able to generate peak power levels greater than the damage threshold of InSb.
<p>B. Second task<br />Analyze the samples using optical, SEM, and TEM microscopy.</p>
<p>2.0 Tasks<br />Sample Delivery.<br />The InSb samples are small thin disks. AFRL/RDLA will either send the samples in a protected enclosure via a shipping service or deliver the samples by hand. The contractor will return the samples in similar manner.</p>
<p>Task 1.<br />AFRL/RDLA will provide InSb material to the contractor.<br />The contractor shall subject the InSb samples with 100fs pulses (or shorter) at 1064nm. <br />The energy of the pulse will be increased from 50% of the damage threshold to 110% of the damage threshold. Two cases exist. These are impinging the sample with (1) a 2 second pulse train and (2) a single shot. The contractor will perform both cases.</p>
<p>Task 2.<br />The contractor will<br />1. Take magnified optical photographs of the material at damage points. Magnifications are 5x and 20x, 40x.<br />2. Examine the damage points with SEM analysis. The emphasis is at points near and just above the damage threshold.<br />3. Examine key damage points with TEM analysis. These key points are just below the damage threshold. Here the search is for induced lattice dislocations.<br />4. With each photograph supply notes on the damage location and damage size, microscope settings, and novel features.<br />This work will be close cooperation with corresponding AFRL/RDLA employees.</p>
<p>3.0 Meetings.<br />Frequent meetings will occur either on site or via telephone/email in order to monitor and direct progress.</p>
<p>4.0 Deliverables.<br />Under this contract the word "deliverable" means photographs and analysis of the damage sites along with notes on the measurement condition. <br />All samples will be returned to RDLA.<br />A formal final report is not required by this contract.</p>
<p>4.0 Project Duration<br />Phase 1. 1-2 months<br />Phase 2. 4-5 months</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLEONLY TO STINGER GHAFFARIAN TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (SGT, INC.) UNDER CONTRACT NUMBERNNA08CG83C FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT (ISRDS) AT NASA AMESRESEARCH CENTER (ARC) LOCATED AT MOFFETT FIELD, CA.  THIS IS AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA).	 ARC modified contract numberNNA08CG83C to fully fund Task Order 76 with ARRA funds.  ARC issued Task Order 76, titledField Test System for Operational Evaluation of Trajectory-Based Automation for En Routeand Transition Airspace. This work supports NASA Recovery Act work sponsored by theAeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the Airspace Systems Program. Researchfunded by this work will focus on addressing the capacity challenges facing the USnational airspace. It is forecast that over the next 15 years, air traffic in the UnitedStates will double, far exceeding the countrys current capability to safely flyaircraft. To handle this growth, NASA is contributing toward the development of the NextGeneration Air Transportation Management System (NextGen). In support of NextGen goals,NASA has developed concepts which improve the efficiency of the National Airspace System(NAS) while maintaining safety.  These concepts require field testing in order todetermine whether projected improvements in the NAS can be realized without compromisingsafety.

<DESC>Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition was to procure software maintenance support for virtual tape migrations, upgrades and consolidations. <br /><br /><br />Strategy Executed
<p>The Dept. of Education, Federal Student Aid Office (FSA) conducted a full and open competition under the GSA Schedule vehicle among contractors who provide the same or similar products. The solicitation was posted to GSA's E-Buy on April 12, 2010, and notification was also sent to the incumbent. The original deadline of April 19th at 4:00PM was subsequently extended to April 23rd at 4:00PM.</p>
<p>FSA received one quote in response to the solicitation, from the incumbent. The incumbent's offer was deemed to be reasonable given that a full and open competition was conducted and that the price was less than what had historically been paid to the incumbent for the provision of such services.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">Based on the above, on May 14, 2010, FSA awarded Contract No. ED-FSA-10-C-0023 to the incumbent, OpenTech Systems, Inc., for a duration of May 31, 2010 through May 30, 2013.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Easky Construction, LLC., W912BV-09-C-1006<br><br>As part of Operations and Maintenance, Army, Recovery Act, modification is a credit of -$19,378.43 and has been issued to Easky Construction, LLC., to perform the following work: Changes described in paragraph 3 and 4 below were proposed in writing by the Contractor at the pre-construction conference on 17 July 09.  All the changes were reviewed and agreed to by the Designer, On-Site QA, and Texoma personnel.  The other changes were identified during construction.  These changes will provide a better product and would be a better use of funds. Changes are as follows:  1. The lump sum price for clearing at Juniper Point East line item No. 1 is reduced from $25,000 to $21,000, a reduction in price of $4,000.  2. The fill material, line item no. 2 at Juniper Point East is reduced from 500 cy to 250 cy, a reduction of 250 cy.  This 250 cy will be move to line item no. 36 at East Burns Run where additional fill is needed.  3. The road base repair, line item 10, at Juniper Point East is reduced from 2,600 sy to 388 sy and these funds will be used for base stabilization, sand seal, and dura-patching at campsite road and main road. This is needed to stabilize the base before double bit surface treatment. 4. The road base repair, line item 25, at Waurika Lake is reduced from 2,160 sy to 90 sy and these funds will be used for base stabilization, double bit surface treatment, and asphalt conditioner.  5. Fill material, line item 36, at East Burns Run is increase fromm 500 cy to 1,500 cy. This was needed to raise the areas around campsites alone the lakeside. 6. Provide approximately 267 tons of 18 inch riprap and filter cloth for shoreline protection at East Burns Run.  7. The pricing is reduced for the transformers at East Burns Run,(bid items 31, 32, and 33), because the local utility company will furnish and install at no cost to the Contractor. The new pricing is for the panels which is a part of the cost of the bid items.  8. Delete campsite 37 at East Burns Run and change campsite 38 to a pull through. This was needed because the existing layout was too close to the water's edge. This would eliminate one 50-amp electric pedestal, one water hydrant and one concrete 6-inch slab with 6-inches of base material.  The pull through campsite will increase the asphalt concrete with 6-inches of base material by 65 SY.

<DESC>Justification Review Document<br/>For Other than Full and Open Competition<br/><br/>Program/Equipment:  Zyvex Prober System<br/>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) per FAR 6.302-2		<br/>Amount:   $319,037.00<br/> <br/><br/>Justification and Approval<br/>For Other Than Full and Open Competition<br/><br/>1a.  Contracting Agency:<br/>U. S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Contracting Center, Adelphi Contracting Division, 2800 Powder Mill Road, Adelphi, MD 20783.<br/><br/>1b.  Requiring Agency:  <br/>U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Ceramics and Transparent Materials Branch, RDRL-WMM-E, Aberdeen Proving Ground, APG, MD 21005.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:<br/>Approval is requested to solicit for award a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract in support of the ARL's Weapons and Materials Research Directorate (WMRD) on the basis of Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Research and Development funding will be utilized for this action.<br/><br/>3. Description of Supplies/Services:<br/>This action is for the purchase of a Zyvex Prober System from DCG Systems, Inc. for use in conjunction with current Government owned FEI Nanolab 600 Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscope.  The system will be used for the characterization of nanostructured devices used for advanced communication systems and will include all accompanying parts, equipment, and training for the Zyvex Prober System. This capability will allow ARL to deliver the on-going research necessary to develop a complete monolithic, phased-array antenna system.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  <br/>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2 "Unusual and compelling urgency."<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  <br/>The Zyvex Prober System is the only system compatible with the current Government owned FEI Nanolab 600 Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscope procured under contract number W911QX-08-C-0103.  No other vendor or system exists that can meet this compataility requirement.  If the Government attempted to procure a system other than the Zyvex Prober System, then the FEI Scanning Electron Microscope would have to be replaced costing the Government in excess of $1,500,000.00 - a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  <br/>No efforts were made to obtain competition.  The  Zyvex Prober System is the only system determined to be compatible with the FEI Scanning Electron Microscope.    The urgency of this action precludes any efforts to obtain competition.  The Government intends to re-evaluate the market at a later date in order to explore alternative technologies and vendors.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  <br/>This is anticipated to be a one time purchase, but if a similar requirement should arise in the future, ARL will continue to seek out all sources that specialize in such equipment to help locate comparable sources.  Technical evaluations of new equipment in the marketplace will be utilized to determine if there are viable sources that can be sought after and considered for competitive solicitations in the future.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  <br/>Market research was conducted through extensive vendor surveying, technical meetings, consultation with experts in the field, and on-site Government meetings among several ARL engineers that possess vast amounts of knowledge, experience, and expertise in the market area. Three (3) other companies, in addition to DGC Systems were investigated to determine if they could successfully satisfy the Government's requirements.  The three (3) other companies determined were Signatone, Kurt J. Lesker Company, and Omicron.  However, none of these companies could meet the required parameter.  Most importantly, none of the other three (3) vendors possess the correct number of ports to connect directly into ARL's Z-axis port.  Extensive research has revealed, no other vendors are capable of satisfying the Government's immediate need for this system except DGC Systems.<br/><br/>9. Interested Sources:<br/>The synopsis notice required by FAR 5.201 has been waived pursuant to FAR 5.202 (a) (2).  The approving official will be notified in writing of any interested sources and the disposition of the inquiry.  A copy of the synopsis waiver is enclosed in the file. <br/><br/>10.  Other Facts:<br/>    a.  Procurement history:<br/>	The system being procured has not been purchased before in the past.  This will be the initial <br/>acquisition of the required Zyvex Prober System.        <br/><br/>    b.  Acquisition Data Availability: <br/>	This action is for the procurement of a Zyvex Prober System and a technical data package suitable <br/>for competition does not exist because this system has not been purchased in the past and is not <br/>foreseen as an ongoing required item in the future.  Also the required prober system is the only <br/>system determined to be compatible with the FEI Scanning Electron Microscope.    <br/><br/>    c.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency: <br/>If the Zyvex Prober System is not procured expeditiously, the aforementioned vulnerabilities increase along with the potential replacement costs of the FEI Scanning Electron of $1,500,000.00.<br/><br/>    d.  Subcontracting Competition:  <br/>No Subcontractor is expected to perform on this contract.<br/><br/>    e.  Follow on Contracts:  <br/>This is not applicable as the statutory authority FAR 6.302-1 was not implemented. <br/>

Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
MODIFICATION TO
FOREST SERVICE CONTRACT AG-7604-C-07-0025
E-GOVERNMENT/ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT
Washington Office AQM IT Branch 


1.  Nature/Description of Action. 

The FS Electronic Government program was chartered by the FS Executive Leadership Team (ELT) in 2001 in response to a Presidential mandate (commonly referred to as The President’s Management Agenda).  The Electronic Government Act of 2002 elevated the mandate to law, re-emphasizing the federal government’s commitment to delivering services to citizens electronically.  

The Forest Service’s investment in electronic government has correspondingly grown over the years and is now in the range of $30-$40 million a year.  In addition to the electronic government mandates, federal agencies have been required to develop and maintain Enterprise Architecture (EA) programs since the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Emphasis on this program, particularly from OMB, has increased steadily to the point where demonstrating EA compliance and proficiency is becoming an IT budget determinant for federal agencies.

The FS led efforts for the Electronic Government and Enterprise Architecture programs are dependent on specialized expertise in a great many technical and business analysis domains.  Personnel having these skills are not yet found to any significant degree in the federal work force.  As a consequence, agencies are critically dependent on acquiring this expertise through contracting.  The Electronic Government - Enterprise Architecture Technical and Management Services Contract (e-Gov Contract) is the vehicle by which the Forest Service implements projects that are transforming the way the FS does business in the Electronic Age.  

This justification seeks approval for the following modifications to Forest Service contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 issued to Innovative Solutions Group, Inc. (ISG).

a.	Increasing the contract ceiling from $60M to $75M for work within scope

The incumbent contractor, Innovative Solutions Group (ISG), is a certified Vietnam Era Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB).  The company recently applied for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) certification.  Their current contract performance is excellent.

2.	Description of Supplies/Services. 

This contract provides the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to State-of-the-Art business analysis, technical analysis, software development, and enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service electronic Government (e-Government) and Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiatives.  

The contract requires the contractor to supply all personnel and resources necessary to provide the Forest Service with management and technical support services for both the e-Government and EA programs. The contractor has performed the following work through task orders issued under aforementioned contract. 

a.	Recreation One Stop (R1S), Recreation Information Data Base (RIDB).
b.	Field Data Automation/Mobile Computing
c.	Weather Information Management System (WIMS) Support Fire and
      Aviation Management (F&AM)
d.	Enterprise Content Management & Office of Regulatory and Management Services (ORMS) Modernization
e.	Electronic Research
f.	Web Information Delivery (FS web internet and intranet web portals)
g.	National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Portal Support
h.	e-Commerce/e-Collections Support for Symbols.gov
i.	Enterprise Architecture Office Support
j.	USDA/FS Enterprise Architecture Repository Support
k.	Electronic Forms (including Government Paperwork Elimination Act
     [GPEA] compliance)
l.	Information Resource (IR) Governance (Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC), Earned Value Management (EVM), & EA)
m.	Streamlining Permitting
n.	Business Requirements Management and Information Management
o.	Electronic Management of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Projects (eMNEPA)
p.	FS Compliance with USDA eAuthentication 
q.	Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) Support
r.	FS Applications Architecture

t.	Operate Program Management Office.

This contract has also served as a vehicle for the FS to rapidly engage the services of specific Subject Matter Experts (SME) as well as to quickly start and complete small highly visible projects such as Customer Feedback, People & Places, Information Security and the FS Strategic IR Framework that would have required significantly longer timeframes for implementation if they were contracted out individually.     

This contract was solicited on September 07, 2005, as a competitively-awarded 8(a) set-aside Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for firm, fixed-price or time and material task order pricing.  The contract was for a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one-year options with a ceiling of $12 million per year over the period of performance of the contract.  

The contract was awarded on May 1, 2006 with an initial ceiling of $24 million.  In February 2008 USDA issued a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA-08-004) for this contract that allowed the FS to raise the ceiling to the amount contemplated in the solicitation of $60 million. The current contract period of performance is through May 1, 2010.  Although, one 1-year option period remains (May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011), it is considered to be in the best interest of the government not to exercise the option, but to extend the contract for six months (May 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010) to allow time for a new competitive contract. The problem is that no ceiling remains to allow the issuance of additional new task orders or modifications to existing task orders.  The contractor has up to one year after contract expiration to deliver on any work not completed prior to this expiration.  To date the FS has obligated approximately $60 million to the contract over a 4-year period.  It is estimated that an additional $15 million (beyond the current $60 million ceiling) is required to meet the proposed additional six month period of performance. This would yield a total ceiling price of $75 Million.  The estimates for upcoming tasks in the following table reflect the program’s best estimate of what will be required to perform work during the increased period of performance:


Fiscal Year	Actual Funds
Obligated
 2006	$13.2M
2007	11.3M
2008	14.2M
2009	16.5M

Total	$60.0M

Fiscal Year	Estimated Funds

Total Estimated	     $15.0M   
Total Obligated	     $60.0M

Projected Total
Ceiling	   
  $75.0M




3.  Statutory Authority for Raising the Contract Ceiling and extending the period of performance.

The statutory authority for the action proposed in this justification includes the following:

41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 Only one responsible source, including FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on contracts and FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique capabilities:  The services required by the FS are available, for the extension period discussed (i.e., prior to when a recompeted contract could be awarded), from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy FS requirements.

4.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications and nature of the acquisition that requires use of the cited authority.  ISG’s unique qualifications applicable to statutory authority 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source” are as follows:

a.	FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on Contract.  The funding for the subject contract represents a sizeable investment in the present contractor team for the FS e-Government and EA programs.  Significant work remains to be completed.  Awarding one or more short term new contracts to continue ongoing work while efforts unfold to award a new competitive contract represents a substantial risk to the FS in terms of: a) duplicate effort to get a new contractor up to speed on applications currently under development, b) getting current work completed in the time required, and c) loss of subject matter expertise for existing tasks and agency-specific knowledge. There is not a reasonable expectation that these kinds of losses could be recovered by the FS through competition of the work that would be accomplished by contract modification to the subject contract.

Existing task orders under current contract have resulted in reaching the contract ceiling.  Funding for the current task orders is expected to be expended by the end of March 2010.  If the ceiling is not raised the contractor support for a significant number of mission critical projects will have to stop until such time as a replacement contract is put in place or contractor services for individual projects are obtained through alternative contract vehicles such as negotiating sole source contracts with certified 8(a) minority owned small businesses.  

It is quite possible that the replacement contract effort for the entire requirement could take up to one year to complete and would thus leave a significant gap in FS EA e-Gov contractor support.   Negotiating alternative sole source contract vehicles for individual projects could take three months or more to complete, especially if six or more contracts are to be issued to meet the full range of services required.  Competitive, individual, short term, replacement contracts would take even longer because of the time necessary to conduct a competition for each portion of the e-Gov contract currently in place.  Any of these alternatives add significant workload to an already understaffed agency staff.  In addition, a gap in the contracting support for many critical projects would occur and result in the FS losing a sizeable amount of intellectual capital, workforce momentum, and key contractor personnel.  Additional detail concerning these losses is provided in part c. below.

b.	FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique Capabilities.  ISG created a consortium of small companies with unique experience and expertise relative to the FS’s e-Government and EA programs.  ISG has also brought additional small businesses on board as the need has arisen.  ISG has subcontracted to a total of thirty-four (34) other small businesses. The list of the thirty-four (34) small businesses and consulting firms that ISG has subcontracted to over the last three years is contained in attachment A.  Since contract inception, almost four years ago, ISG developed unique FS e-Gov knowledge and expertise as the incumbent contractor.  It is estimated that it would take 12 months or more for another contractor to gain the overall knowledge and expertise that ISG currently has on this FS e-Gov contract.  Because of this unique partnership it could take up to six separate contracts with various companies to meet the single contract under ISG currently. 

c.	Rationale for Contract Ceiling Increase 

1.	The Enterprise Architecture and Electronic Government work has matured, in the last 3-3/4 years, from experimental innovation to a proven methodology to dramatically improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agency business processes.  The success stories from these efforts are starting to get wide spread exposure and discussion, in part because Communication of proven Business Solution development successes is a step in the methodology.  The result of this spread of the success stories is a steady increase in requests for Business Analysis and Enterprise Architecture contractor support from efforts all around the agency; efforts that are striving to drive out costs, increase outputs, and improve outcomes achieved by, unit and staff business processes. This amount of very legitimate business need for using the EA eGov contract was not foreseen when the contract was initially put together.

2.	The initial contract anticipated a small amount of use by other USDA agencies partnering with the FS.  This past fiscal year (2009) that anticipation underwent an almost $3 million dollar expansion, in part, as USDA OCIO adopted key aspects of the FS EA approach and thus found the FS EA contractors as the obvious source for their support needs.  The major factor in USDA use of the contract resulted from the FS success with the USDA mandated Web Portal implementation which caught the attention of the NRCS Office of Communications.  NRCS leadership subsequently approved a $6 million, 3-year effort to "clone" the FS Web Portal framework and "reuse" a great many of the Portal components developed and perfected in the FS efforts.  The obvious contractor support option for the NRCS effort was the FS Portal contractor team.  Word of the FS success and the NRCS collaboration with FS on the Web Portal implementation is fast getting around to other agencies in the Department and can be expected to generate additional demand for use of the FS contract.  These kinds of developments were not at all foreseen in the establishment of the initial contract ceiling and are now expected to account for up to $4 to $5 million a year.  The amount of annual increase is being limited to the $8 million/yr because that is the most the current FS EA eGov staff (permanent federal employees) can adequately manage.  Both sources of change described above have potential to grow fast enough that the $8 million/yr will leave unmet demand.  The hard constraint for meeting that demand will be lack of federal staff.  These supply vs. demand factors will be addressed as the FS CIO plans the follow-on contracting strategy and vehicle.

5.  Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Not applicable.  
6. The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  This is based on the competitive and historical pricing data obtained.
7.  The market research conducted and results.  Adequate competition was received initially.  Despite the recent economic down-turn there is no indication that resolicitation would result in lower prices to the Government for these services.  Market research was based on initial offers received and then informally validated based on experience of the current acquisition team with pricing for similar professional services.
8.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The estimated cost to the Government might sustain if the contract must be recompeted in lieu of increasing the existing contract ceiling is $50 million of loss to applications under development but not yet completed.  This estimate was developed by the e-Gov Program managers and based on experience with the tasks that are underway for the program. The estimate of the loss due to degraded fire support should the Weather Information Management System (WIMS) alone lose contractor support could resulting in potential loss of life and near certain loss of property is at least $100 million.  This estimate is quite conservative as: a) loss of life is not something to be measured in dollars, and b) in the wildland urban interface, credible estimation techniques value a single acre lost to wildfire in the neighborhood of $1 million dollars.
9. Listing of the sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  Not applicable.
10. Actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. Efforts to recompete the contract were initiated in late spring 2009 but existing workload for the CIO has caused these efforts to proceed slower than expected.  This requirement will be competed in the future as it was in the past.  A recompetition will be conducted with a competitive award in time to allow for sufficient transition of ongoing work to a new contractor.

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:   
The VA has been mandated to standardize equipment.  Other Steris Sterilizers have been recently purchased and are proceeding with standardization.

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  
No other vendors were found to be authorized distributors/provider of Steris products/services.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:   
Pricing has been determined fair and reasonable with reference to previous purchases and similar work performed in line with the industry standard.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  
A pre-solicitation notice was posted on April 16, 2010 for a similar Steris package and no vendors were identified to provide this proprietary service portion of the package.  It would not be in the best interest to compete out this portion of the work due to liability concerns and higher administrative burden.  However, it may be possible for Steris to sub-contract out a portion of the requirement to a local vendor.   

9.  Other Considerations:  
This particular acquisition is supported by VA Mandated standardization efforts.

10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Street Address:  8029 Flint  	
City, State, Zip:  Lenexa, Kansas 66214	
Phone:  913 894-5962	

3.  Description of Services:  The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 60,000.00.  Describe the services or supplies, including make & model number, to be acquired below.
The proposed action is to provide factory refurbishment to OEM performance specifications utilizing factory parts and factory service technicians to repair the two (2) Carrier 30GXN Air Cooled Chiller (Model #30GXN301F-640FX) serving surgery department. 
Due to impact surgery chillers have to medical center's OR operations and level of care, performance of both units shall be factory certified and commissioned to ensure reliability and completeness of refurbishment including installation of current software and firmware upgrades.

4.  Authority Cited:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following, but other exceptions may be used.)     SOLE SOURCE

0  (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements OR

1  (b)  10 USC 2304(c)(2) or 41 USC 253(c)(2); FAR 6.302-2:  Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: (State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.)

0  (a)  Services can only be provided from the original source as this is a follow-on requirement
for the continued provision of highly specialized services.

0  (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the
Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

1  (c)  Services/Supplies are needed immediately to satisfy mission requirements.

       (d)  Additional Information:

(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?
      Safety and care of VA surgery patients is jeopardized as both primary surgery chillers are not functional and temporary chiller does NOT provide redundant chilled water capabilities as required per VHA regulations to maintain proper climate control in OR area.  Refurbishing main primary chillers with OEM parts and performing factory performance start-up, certification, and commissioning is paramount to ensuring continued reliability and warranty of the chillers.


(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?
     To ensure safety and reliability of the primary surgery chillers and re-establish performance standards, OEM components installed by factory authorized trained technicians to facilitate Carrier factory performed start-up services and factory certification of operation of both refurbished units needed to ensure strict climatic control for OR suites.

6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)
     Market research to determine level of available factory trained service contractors locally and nationally and contractors that are factory trained and authorized to perform start-up and provide factory performance certification.

7.  Market Research:  (Describe the extent of the market research conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.  "Market Research" is defined as those attempts you made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  Research of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.)
Market research consisted of web research of Carrier chiller authorized repair contractors and contact of local Carrier factory representative to obtain list of factory authorized trained technicians and branch offices.

8.  Procurement History:

Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number:        or 0  N/A
Previously competed?	0  N/A	1  No		0  Yes
Previous authority for less than Full & Open Competition:  

9.  Technical / Requirements Certification:  I certify that the support data under my cognizance which is included in this abbreviated-J&A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
