<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to award to ETS Lindgren, LP, 1301 Arrow Point Drive, Cedar Park, TX, 78613-6936, on an Other Than Full and Open Competitive basis, for the refurbishment and reconfiguration of an existing Small rectangular electromagnetic chamber facility located at NRL-DC.  As the original manufacturer and supplier of the anechoic material, the reconfiguration of the chamber must be structurally compatible with the existing electromagnetic chamber capabilities.  The original manufacturer of the chamber would delete the continuous requirement for extensive structural analysis and testing to ensure complete compatibility of replaced anechoic materials.  Elimination of the additional analysis and testing would result in reduced cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>NNH05ZDA003O Release Date:  August 23, 2005 Notice of Intent Due:  September 27, 2005 Proposals Due:	November 22, 2005 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is releasing Announcement of Opportunity NNH05ZDA003O for the opportunity to conduct space science investigations through the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) mission, which is part of the Living with a Star (LWS) Geospace Program.	In particular, the opportunity is to provide understanding, ideally to the point of predictability, of how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space are formed or changed in response to the variable inputs of energy from the Sun.  Of special interest are the controlling mechanisms of particle and field variations responsible for energetic particle acceleration, transport, and loss processes.  Proposed investigations must provide identical pairs of individual instruments or identical pairs of suites of instruments.  This Announcement of Opportunity also invites proposals for Missions of Opportunity that effectively fulfill LWS Geospace specific objectives through an investigation that is carried on a mission sponsored by an organization other than NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Participation in this announcement will be open to all categories of organizations, domestic and non-U.S., including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies.  Proposals involving multiple organizations should be submitted by a single Principal Investigator (PI) through the business office of the PI’s institution which becomes the Lead Institution.  The intent of this solicitation is to provide funding to U.S. institutions; non-U.S. organizations are eligible to propose, but are not eligible to receive funding.  Upon its release date, this Announcement of Opportunity will be available electronically through the NASA Research Opportunities home page at  http://nspires.nasaprs.com. Direct questions specifically regarding this solicitation to:  Dr. Barbara L. Giles, LWS Geospace Program Scientist, Earth-Sun System Division, Mail Suite 3Q39, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001; TEL: (202) 358-1762; E-mail: Barbara.Giles@nasa.gov (subject line to read "LWS RBSP AO"). This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d) (2). Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Uplink Services for the NASA Connect Series. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the National Educational Telecommunications Association (NETA), the non-profit professional association that provides the day time educational and instructional programming to PBS television licensees and stations in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.  NETA also operates the satellite that is used by PBS stations that down link our programming.  PBS stations do not have to reposition and recalibrate their satellite dishes thus avoiding time, considerable cost, and distruption of services associated with repositioning. Authority for sole source is FAR 13.106-1.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 16, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the development of a Magnetostrictive Valve (MMV) that controls fluid flow when electrical power is applied. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item from Orion Propulsion Inc on a Sole Source Basis for the following reasons. 1.Orion is in negotiations with MSFC for a Space Act Agreement	to do related work based on their knowledge of thruster valve design requirements for throttling. 2.Orion has a unique capability to develop small components through testing using in-house fabrication, test, and engineering capabilities. The valve will be developed and tested on a small thruster through hot fire. 3. Recent visits to all the RCS engine development shops have shown that none have developed their own valves in-house and do not have rocket engines available for testing the valves.  Orion is uniquely qualified to provide both the valve development and engine level testing.	Attached to this solicitation is the statement of work for viewing. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This procurement is strictly for "Small Business Set-Aside" only.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory in Las Vegas, NV intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Canberra Industries, Inc. of Meriden, CT. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain nine (9) uniSpec fully integrated multichannel analyzers and three (3) units with Genie 2000 software to support R&IE's first-tier calibration laboratory as it provides radon gas and progeny calibration,  measurement, and technical analysis to EPA's programs.  R&IE maintains multiple counting systems for radon gas and radon decay progeny. All of the existing major radon counting systems, including the pulse ionization chamber system, NaI(Tl) radon canister counting system, and Lucas cell PMT alpha  scintillation counting system, perform radon analysis via Genie 2000 spectroscopy software. It has been determined that Canberra Industries, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement because the hardware and electronics for these systems must be compatible with the current  spectroscopy system. Any deviation from this requirement would require additional spectroscopy analysis hardware and software, development of custom in-house programming, reconfiguration of existing systems into split systems running different analysis software, and extensive training. In addition,  market research has indicated there is no other known manufacturer that produces a detector base capable of meeting these requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed  requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Michael Brinkmiller, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2013
<DESC>NAICS Code: 513340   This is a combined synopsis/request for quotation (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  The RFQ number is RFQ-OH-05-00181. This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.   The NAIC is 517410, the size standard for which is $12.5 Million.  The successful contractor shall provide satellite production services for EstuaryLive 2005 in  accordance with the following specifications/statement of work: Introduction The mission of EPA=s Ocean and Coastal Protection Division (OCPD) is to improve the quality of coastal and marine ecosystems in the face of growing watershed threats. To accomplish this, OCPD provides leadership to  catalyze public and private cooperative actions, takes steps to prevent and control pollution, and sets measurable goals to chart progress and improve OCPD programs.  OCPD, in partnership with NOAA=s Estuarine Reserves Division, is coordinating a National Estuaries Day campaign, an annual Coast  Weeks celebration, to educate the public about the importance of estuaries and the need to protect them.  National Estuaries Day is September 24, 2005.  This year=s featured National Estuaries Day event is EstuaryLive 2005 - to be held September 22 B 23, 2005. EstuaryLive 2005 is a live,  interactive field trip on the Web through our nation=s estuaries, targeting a K-12 classroom audience.  A remote integration and coordination facility, program coordinator, and the contractor will receive satellite feed from five remote sites 3 US coasts, serially, over two days. Graphics will be  added to this satellite feed and will send it back to a satellite for downlink by receivers, including closed captioners, and an Internet video streaming service.  School classes stream the program live from the Internet and pull the program directly off of the satellite.  They use the Internet to  return questions to the current live site for answers. EstuaryLive 2005 will include programs from National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs) and National Estuary Programs (NEPs), located in: Garibaldi, Oregon; Tiburon, California; Jersey City and Tuckerton, New Jersey; and Moss Point,  Mississippi. Each of these sites will broadcast a program that will last a maximum of 1 hour 10 minutes. Each site will provide an on-camera field trip host that serves as a tour guide for their program. The host for each program will introduce trained naturalists and other experts provided by the  site.  A facet of this program that makes it so unique is that participants watching the program have an opportunity to submit questions during the program.  Individuals provided by the live site will receive questions by email and many of these questions will be integrated into their live program.   At this time we have not determined the content of each site=s program for 2005. There will be one additional 1-hour EstuaryLive program that will incorporate three of the five listed sites: Tuckerton, New Jersey; Moss Point, Mississippi; and Garibaldi, Oregon.  For this program, all three sites  need to be seen on the same screen (a quad screen, the fourth block will be a logo), and all sites need to be able to see and hear one another speak real time - they will be communicating with one another.  All sites will not need to be viewed on the quad screen for the entire hour- segments of the  program will feature just one site at a time and we will cut back and forth from individual sites to the quad-split.  Please visit www.estuaries.gov to view last year=s program (including the EstuaryLive coast to coast program).  Throughout the two-day program, each of the five sites do not need  to be live all of the time  (they should only be live for programs they are actively participating in), but they must be up live in sufficient time to establish good connections and allow for last minute changes.  Normally we will cut directly between sites with no pauses.  The "next site" should  always be up live 30-minutes prior to their showtime for technical evaluation.  The maximum number of sites that will be live on the satellite at any one time is 3 (for the EstuaryLive Coast to Coast segment). There will be no Internet connections at most of the sites. EstuaryLive 2005  Schedule* Thursday, September 22, 2005 Time  (EDT)	 Location 11 - 12	 Jersey City, New Jersey 12 - 1	 Tuckerton, New Jersey 1 - 2	 Tiburon, California Friday, September 23, 2005 Time  (EDT)	 Location 11 - 12	 Moss Point, Mississippi 12 - 1	 Garibaldi, Oregon 1 - 2	 Coast to Coast  Program *Subject to change Each of the six sites (6th site is Tuckerton, New Jersey location on second day) will need a satellite truck with uplink/downlink capabilities and a camera crew with equipment. The five feeds will need to be downlinked to up to 4 signals (3 remote and 1 integration  point) at one time and integrate video and graphics into the program.  The contractor must be able to act as the downlink integration and coordination point.  The contractor must also have the capability to work with a host site (Tuckerton, New Jersey) which would act as the downlink and  integration and coordination center should technical difficulties arise prior to the broadcast.  If a host site was to be used as a downlink integration and coordination center, the contractor must supply a satellite truck with up to 9 video inputs, two KU downlinks and redundant power sources  (plus specialized equipment)- this will be outlined later in the document.  The contractor shall work with the EPA and NOAA to provide satellite and technical support services crucial to the production of EstuaryLive 2005.  The contractor must also provide camera crews for each of the five sites,  in addition to providing on-air graphics for the two-day program. NOAA will provide the Program Producer for the two-day event. The Program Producer is responsible for all pre-show communication with Reserves and NEP sites working with these sites to make sure inserts, needed graphics, tape  roll-ins, site maps and directions are all provided to the Satellite contractor in a timely manner. Support Requirements The contractor shall work directly with the EstuaryLive Coordinator, Project Officer in the EPA=s Ocean and Coastal Protection Division, and personnel from NOAA to provide  satellite, technical, camera services and staff support as well as production assistance crucial to the production of EstuaryLive 2005.  The contractor shall be located at either the host site (Tuckerton, New Jersey) or a remote site deemed acceptable by the EstuaryLive Coordinator and Program  Producer. The contractor shall provide overall management of elements for video production and satellite transmission. The contractor must have solid live broadcast experience and the ability to design, communicate, manage, and direct the live video, graphic, and satellite elements. The  contractor shall provide a Director experienced in live television to coordinate the production and placement of vendor produced chyrons, direct tape roll-ins, direct on-site camera operators, switch between sources and segments. The Director will be responsible for working with the Program  Producer to maintain an overall high level of production quality. The contractor shall serve as Satellite Production Coordinator (SPC) for the event.   As the SPC, the contractor will be responsible for insuring that all satellite locations will be effectively managed and directed as a live video  event.  The contractor shall coordinate in person with the Program Producer (provided through a separate contract) to organize all the elements and personnel needed for the successful completion of the EstuaryLive 2005 interactive satellite webcast. The contractor must be able to process video,  graphics and satellite requests from the Program Producer in house.  To minimize the pre-production time and effort spent by the EPA in ensuring that the contractor fully understands the caliber and quality of EstuaryLive 2005, the contractor should: 1)  be able to be able to make split second  decisions on site during the broadcast, and 2) have a good understanding of the goals and objectives of EstuaryLive as set forth in this statement of work.  Items provided by the contractor: The Satellite Production Coordinator (SPC) shall serve to direct and coordinate the overall production of  EstuaryLive 2005, including but not limited to: -	management of production setup and schedule,  -	provision of satellite uplink equipment and personnel for the 5 sites and/or the remote coordination and integration facility -	integration of the 5 estuary remote sites into the broadcast, integration  of one Acoast to coast@ program that incorporates live feeds from three remote sites at one time, three way live conversation and digital quad graphic effect. -	ensure the technical quality of each satellite feed, -	monitor program content and quality,  -	switch to remote sites and overlay graphics  as directed by the line producer (EPA and NOAA will provide logos) - 	prepare a communications plan between all remote satellite sites Please note that that largest number of remote sites operating simultaneously will be three, therefore the host site or the remote coordination and integration  facility will need up to 3 land telephone lines for the EstuaryLive Coast to Coast segment plus 3 telephone lines for satellite communications- if these need to be installed, the contractor shall be responsible for the cost of installation. Production Staff provided by the contractor at the host  site or remote integration and coordination facility will at minimum include: Director, Audio Mixer, Audio Assist, Graphics Operator, and Generator Technician (if redundant power is hard-wired from the power company the Generator Technician would not be needed).  The contractor must include  specifications for the two following methods (prices should be separated): (1) If the contractor acts as the remote integration and coordination facility, the contractor must have the following capabilities and equipment:  		- Beta SP playback -  3 satellite downlinks  (from remote sites) and 1  satellite uplink for transmission to streaming video/captioning provider as well as museums and universities - At least three phone lines will be necessary to communicate with other sites for the Acoast to   coast@ segment - DV-cam recorder for show archiving - Ten new184-minute DV-cam record  tapes for archiving program - Collage graphics integration equipment or equivalent high quality  graphics system. The contractor shall provide 5 KU satellite transportable uplinks with engineers, cameras, and camera crews with at least 800 feet of camera cable.  As many as three sites may require  up to 1500 feet of camera cable.  Each remote site is one camera, hand-held, live for the duration so camera operators must be experienced and capable of long periods of hand-held live shooting while moving from location to location.  Cameras and all field equipment must operate on battery power.   The Director must be able to talk to the camera operator.  The satellite truck and camera crews should arrive on location the evening prior to their event for setup and testing.  If a host truck is used then that location should be setup up the day before the event.   The contractor shall provide  approximately 15 hours of analogue KU satellite transponder time on the same KU Satellite or satellites as required to accomplish back-to-back sites transmission over the two day event.  This will involve sites cutting directly to other sites.  Remote sites may or may not directly introduce the  next site.  The EstuaryLive Coast to Coast will require three sites to be live at one time.  Contractor should specify transponder time by the hour in the event that more or less time may be required.   In the event that one or more sites may be combined, the contractor should spec satellite  trucks and crew by the site, so that costs are minimized.  Note that each remote site should be able to downlink the master feed from the host site for remote integration and coordination facility and use the third audio channel for IFB type communication.    (2) If the contractor elects to use  Tuckerton, New Jersey as the host site, the satellite truck will serve as master control and should have standard production facilities with the following equipment: two production cameras will be required along with Beta SP playback; a third mobile, and a fourth and fifth fixed/robotic cameras  using microwave transmission for second site will be provided using existing equipment.   In total, there need to be up to 5 live cameras (three with camera operators), 1 Beta SP Playback plus a back up, and 2 satellite downlinks (from remote sites) for a total of 9 input sources plus graphics.  In  addition, at least three phone lines will be necessary to communicate with other sites for the Acoast to coast@ segment.  There is minimal cell phone service at this location, so the contractor shall be responsible for installing any necessary Aland@ phone lines on site.  In addition, the  contractor should provide an auxiliary generator or arrange for hard-wired power on-location . Supplemental equipment will also include: - An air-conditioned trailer to house certain production elements if required (7x14 or better) - A redundant power generator on site to power Satellite truck and  all support equipment (in addition to the truck generator). - Two Ikegami triax cameras with 800= of cable - RTS communications system for production staff - DV-cam recorder for show archiving (NOAA/EPA will bring additional recorder) - Ten new184-minute DV-cam record tapes for archiving program -  Collage graphics integration equipment or equivalent with capabilities for moving graphics, still store, etc. The contractor shall design and implement the graphics look for the broadcast and apply this look using a collage graphics system or equivalent that will include character generator and  electronic still store.  The contractor shall provide a graphic artist to create lower thirds and graphic elements and a CG operator during the show.  We estimate that graphic creation may require 10-20 hours of artist time (based on past years).  Graphic requirements will not be fully finalized  until the week before the production. The contractor shall be responsible for all travel, per diem and lodging for production staff and satellite engineers provided by contractor at the host site or facility and remote sites.  The contractor shall be responsible for all craft services (lunch and  snacks) for the provided crew at all locations.  Contractor should be aware that requirements of the host site may require straight through work with no specified time for lunch, however this likely will not be the case. The contractor shall record the production n three-hour DV-cam tapes.  The  contractor should provide DV- cam recorder (DSR-50, 80 or equivalent) for recording the show from the host truck or remote location. The contractor shall provide 10 three-hour DV-cam tapes for archiving as noted above.  Tapes will be given to the producers at end of show.  The contractor shall  provide liability and equipment insurance to cover each location and host site and all equipment provided by contractor. The encoding to the webcast will not be done onsite. The server/streaming provider shall provide this service under a separate contract. The webcast components of EstuaryLive  2005 will be provided under a separate contract for streaming services. All equipment provided by the contractor should be fully weatherproofed for use in a hostile, marine environment. These are harsh, wet and windy, saltspray filled environments. Each remote site is one camera, hand-held, live  for the duration so camera operators must be experienced and capable of long periods of hand-held live shooting while moving from location to location.  Cameras and all field equipment must operate on battery power.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Margaret M. Kubale , Cincinnati, Ohio.
Purpose:

The journal Public Health Reports needs assistance in gathering information, drafting articles and commentary, and assisting Journal contributors who need help in rewriting manuscripts to render them suitable for publishing.

There is a great deal of editing, rewriting, and research required to support the Journal’s schedule of publication, which is not possible for the current staff editor to keep up with.  In addition to the regular work of the Journal, there are a number of special projects (i.e. supplements, rewriting for authors, coordination of commentary) that is more episodic in nature than the regular production needs.  Editorial help will help fill in for both the routine tasks that are predictable, and for highly specialized tasks that arise. 
For professional research and writing consulting services, Margaret Kubale is the sole source vendor because:

She was a principal developer of the Journal’s current style.  She is familiar with the process which she helped establish over the last year.  Also during the past year she has worked closely with the Journal’s design and layout contractor (CCSI) and the Publisher (Elsevier) and has a thorough working knowledge of how those two entities process the Journal’s work.  

She is an accomplished writer, with an exceptional ability to listen well and summarize clearly and logically what she has heard.  She has an especially sensitive and rare ability to change her writing style to fit the tonal qualities of the speaker, and audience, and the forum, a particularly important skill for the assignments she will be given.

 She has worked with governmental agencies, private sector health care facilities, and clinical trial research laboratories, and she understands the issues, dynamics, and complexities of public process, policy, and needs.


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL

DESC: INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WITH NOVA Engineering.  The Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Nova Engineering, 5 Circle Freeway Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45246.

MODEL:	MMT28

Description:	36 each Hypermod S-Band Transmitters and 11 each L-Band Hypermod Transmitters, Model MMT28

This acquisition is for Hypermod MMT28 S-Band and L-Band Transmitters.

The transmitter is available in both L-Band and S-band versions and is remotely tunable in 1 MHz step.  The transmitter is capable of transmitting all three types of Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) waveforms:  (1) multi-h CPM, (2) SOQPSK, and (3) PCM/FM at bit rates of 50 Kbps to 27.8 Mbps (13.9 Mbps for PCM).  In effect, there is more information available that can be relayed to the ground and this will enhance the mission.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334220 and the size standard is 750 employees. 
 
Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT: The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA and the Center for Coastal Environmental Health Bimolecular Research Laboratory (CCEHBR), has a requirement to renew a service contract on the automation maintenance on the Siemens System 600 Controls System for the energy management system for all the HVAC and refrigeration sensors and proprietary software. The Apogee/Siemens system licensed by CMI, Inc. is a proprietary Direct Digital Control (DDC) system for automated building controls, emergency notification and preventative maintenance. It serves as the central nervous system of the CCEHBR laboratory facility and monitors and controls all critical operating environment parameters.  Any other system would result in redundant features, additional materials and loss of function and efficiency by not having an integral central system for the CCEHBR facility. Currently CMI is the original installer of the existing system and they are the warranty holder for all the Siemens/Apogee systems presently in the building, and the site license for the existing energy management system proprietary software is also held by CMI.  By going to other contractors, the government would lose their existing warranties on our energy management system and emergency notification system. This violation of the proprietary contract could have the government remove and install new control boards, circuit cards and software throughout the complete 38,000 square foot building at a cost prohibited expense. Period of Coverage: September 1, 2005 through August 31, 2006. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is Control Management Inc., 3101 Carlisle Street, Columbia, SC 29205. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this service. Such information shall include at a minimum: name; telephone numbers of firms to whom this service or similar service have been previously provided evidence of being as certified by CMI to provide the services. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability by sending an email message referencing the Requisition No. NCNS4000-5-00161KLC to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax the information with an email address to telephone number 816-426-7530, ATTN: Karen Christian. The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on affirmative responses to this notice. The NAICS code for this action is 561990. This requirement shall be considered a small business set-aside. The Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) requires all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contract Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR and ORCA. For information and to register, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 10 each Meter, Radiation Hazard, L-3 Communications-Narda Microwave East Model No. EMR-20, P/N 2244/20; NSN:  6625-01-492-3940. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. This item is used to support the NEXRAD spare parts program.  The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12,  Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is L3 Communications – Narda Microwave East, 435 Moreland Road, Hauppauge, NY 11788. L3 Communications P/N EMR-20 has been determined is technically superior because the low end of the dynamic range on the meter affords the opportunity to detect non-ionizing radiation leaks at an earlier time when they are small. This product detects leaks with more precision and in smaller amounts than other competitive products. This product is more durable, requires a two year calibration cycle already established by the government and contains a rechargeable battery eliminating the need for frequent battery replacement at a low recurring cost to the government. The government believes it is in their best interest to acquire these meters from L3 Communications in order to support standardization of support tools within the NEXRAD network thereby reducing the support load for maintaining additional equipment configurations. However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified product. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability by sending an email message to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax the information with an email address to telephone number 816-426-7530 ATTN: Karen Christian. The government reserves the right to solicit bids based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. The NAICS code for this action is 335999.

Destination Information:  Indefinite quantities will be delivered to various locations.


All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The subject requirement is for the acquisition of forty (40) NSNs with various item descriptions and end items.  This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class 2510, 2520, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 2910, 2920, 2930, 2940, 2990, and 4910.  The requirement will result in an award of an Indefinite Delivery Type Contract for which Delivery Orders may be placed for one (1) year.   The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed five (5) years.    See Note(s): 12 and 26.  The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of Aug 19 2005.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS 
13 JULY 2005
1.0 SCOPE
The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of larger absorber in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 1,680 EACH 72 inch absorbers are needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies.
2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
IEEE STANDARD 1128. Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz.

NRL Report 8093.  Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers.  
3.0 REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Testing
Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on table below.)









The break points are listed in the table below:

Frequency (MHz)	Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB)
80	-20
120	-30
200	-40
300	-40
500	-45

3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints
Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorbers final performance. 

The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov through 2 Dec 2005.

The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery.

3.3 Fire Retardant
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  

3.4 Physical Characteristics
Overall Height:	72 inches +/-0.5 inch
Overall Absorber Footprint:	24 inches square +/-0.125 inch
Pyramids per Piece:	1
Pyramid Shape:	Conventional microwave absorber
Base Height:	12 inches +/-0.25 inch
Pyramid Height:	60 inches +/-0.25 inch
Fire Retardant Loading:	1.1 lbs/ft(to the third power) +/-5%
Paint:	Light Blue
Installation Backing:	None
Carbon Compound Loading:	TBD* +/-5%
* Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/feet to the third power, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.


3.4 Past Performance Requirements
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements:
 a. RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2)
 b. Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
 3. Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.5 Program Management
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

<SUBJECT>A -- A SOLICITATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) CONTRACT PROPOSALS
<SOLNBR>PHS-2006-1
<RESPDATE>110405
<ARCHDATE>11192005
<CONTACT>Office of Extramural Programs Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health, Phone 301-435-2688, Fax null, Email none
<DESC>Innovative technologies and methodologies fuel progress in biomedical and behavioral research and represent an increasingly important area of the economy.  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program provides support for research and development (R&D) of new or improved technologies and methodologies that have the potential to succeed as commercial products.

The purpose of this notice is to (1) announce the issuance of the SOLICITATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH CONTRACT PROPOSALS (PHS 2006-1) with a due date of NOVEMBER 5, 2006 for receipt of SBIR CONTRACT proposals; and (2) inform the public about the opportunities that the SBIR program offers to small business concerns as well as to scientists at research institutions.  The SBIR legislation requires the Public Health Service (PHS), Department of Health and Human Services, and certain other federal agencies to reserve 2.5 percent of their extramural research or R&D budgets for an SBIR program.  The PHS SBIR set-aside requirement for FY 2004 is $571 million.

The offeror organization must be a small business concern as defined by the Small Business Administration and described in the Solicitation, and the PRIMARY EMPLOYMENT of the principal investigator MUST be with the small business concern at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project. In accord with the intent of the SBIR program to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D, scientists at research institutions can play an important role in an SBIR project by serving as consultants and/or subcontractors to the small business concern.  Generally, one-third of the Phase I budget may be spent on consultant and/or subcontractual costs, and, generally, one-half of the Phase II budget may be spent on such costs. In this manner, a small business concern with limited expertise and/or research facilities may benefit from teaming with a Scientist(s)at a research institution; for the scientist(s)at a research institution, this team effort provides support for R&D not otherwise obtained.

The SBIR program consists of the following three phases:

PHASE I: The objective of this phase is to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility and potential for commercialization of the proposed research or R&D efforts and the quality of performance of the small business concern, before consideration of further federal support in Phase II. Generally, Phase I SBIR awards do not exceed $100,000 for direct costs, Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs, and negotiated fixed fee for a period generally not to exceed six months.

PHASE II: The objective of this phase is to continue the research or R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding shall be based on the results of Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the Phase II proposal. Only Phase I contractors are eligible to apply for Phase II funding, and Phase II proposals may be submitted upon the request of the Contracting Officer ONLY.  (However, see "Fast-Track" Initiative below.) Generally, Phase II awards do not exceed $750,000 for direct costs, F&A costs, and negotiated fixed fee for a period generally not to exceed two years.  That is, generally, a two-year Phase II project does not cost more than $750,000 for that project.  Only one Phase II award may be made for any SBIR project.

PHASE III: The objective of this phase is for the small business concern to pursue, with non-SBIR funds, the commercialization of the results of the research or R&D funded in Phases I and II.

"FAST-TRACK" INITIATIVE: (Applicable only to proposals submitted to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and only if an awarding component indicates it is accepting Fast Track proposals for a particular topic.)

The Fast-Track initiative is an opportunity for small business concerns to submit both a Phase I and Phase II proposal for concurrent peer review. This initiative also has the potential to minimize any funding gap between Phase I and Phase II. Proposals must be prepared in accordance with Phase I and Phase II proposal preparation instructions.

Following are the research topics contained in the SOLICITATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH CONTRACT PROPOSALS (PHS 2006-1) for the contract proposal RECEIPT DATE of NOVEMBER 4, 2005:

<DESC>Innovative technologies and methodologies fuel progress in biomedical and behavioral research and represent an increasingly important area of the economy.  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program provides support for research and development (R&D) of new or improved technologies and methodologies that have the potential to succeed as commercial products.

The purpose of this notice is to (1) announce the issuance of the SOLICITATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH CONTRACT PROPOSALS (PHS 2006-1) with a due date of NOVEMBER 5, 2006 for receipt of SBIR CONTRACT proposals; and (2) inform the public about the opportunities that the SBIR program offers to small business concerns as well as to scientists at research institutions.  The SBIR legislation requires the Public Health Service (PHS), Department of Health and Human Services, and certain other federal agencies to reserve 2.5 percent of their extramural research or R&D budgets for an SBIR program.  The PHS SBIR set-aside requirement for FY 2004 is $571 million.

The offeror organization must be a small business concern as defined by the Small Business Administration and described in the Solicitation, and the PRIMARY EMPLOYMENT of the principal investigator MUST be with the small business concern at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed project. In accord with the intent of the SBIR program to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D, scientists at research institutions can play an important role in an SBIR project by serving as consultants and/or subcontractors to the small business concern.  Generally, one-third of the Phase I budget may be spent on consultant and/or subcontractual costs, and, generally, one-half of the Phase II budget may be spent on such costs. In this manner, a small business concern with limited expertise and/or research facilities may benefit from teaming with a Scientist(s)at a research institution; for the scientist(s)at a research institution, this team effort provides support for R&D not otherwise obtained.

The SBIR program consists of the following three phases:

PHASE I: The objective of this phase is to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility and potential for commercialization of the proposed research or R&D efforts and the quality of performance of the small business concern, before consideration of further federal support in Phase II. Generally, Phase I SBIR awards do not exceed $100,000 for direct costs, Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs, and negotiated fixed fee for a period generally not to exceed six months.

PHASE II: The objective of this phase is to continue the research or R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding shall be based on the results of Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the Phase II proposal. Only Phase I contractors are eligible to apply for Phase II funding, and Phase II proposals may be submitted upon the request of the Contracting Officer ONLY.  (However, see "Fast-Track" Initiative below.) Generally, Phase II awards do not exceed $750,000 for direct costs, F&A costs, and negotiated fixed fee for a period generally not to exceed two years.  That is, generally, a two-year Phase II project does not cost more than $750,000 for that project.  Only one Phase II award may be made for any SBIR project.

PHASE III: The objective of this phase is for the small business concern to pursue, with non-SBIR funds, the commercialization of the results of the research or R&D funded in Phases I and II.

"FAST-TRACK" INITIATIVE: (Applicable only to proposals submitted to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and only if an awarding component indicates it is accepting Fast Track proposals for a particular topic.)

The Fast-Track initiative is an opportunity for small business concerns to submit both a Phase I and Phase II proposal for concurrent peer review. This initiative also has the potential to minimize any funding gap between Phase I and Phase II. Proposals must be prepared in accordance with Phase I and Phase II proposal preparation instructions.

Following are the research topics contained in the SOLICITATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH CONTRACT PROPOSALS (PHS 2006-1) for the contract proposal RECEIPT DATE of NOVEMBER 4, 2005:

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336212   This RFQ is being cancelled.  The specifications for the trailers were not correct.  This requirement will be reposted with a new RFQ. This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as  supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 336212.  The specifications for the 18 Foot Enclosed Trailer is listed below:   Amendment #1  (Technical Questions)     18 Foot Enclosed Cargo Trailer I have a few specific questions.  My interpretation of the RFQ includes 6 floor mounted tie downs (each with 5000 lb. rating) and an E- track system, which allows other attachments to be used anywhere along the track.  Do you want E tack on  both the floor and the walls, or only on the walls (including the front wall)?  Do you also need wall track on the side access door?  Response: Track system should be on the 2 side walls and the front wall of the trailer. The track system should not be on the side door. Regarding the awning, the  RFQ indicates the awning should span from the back of the trailer to the side door.  Do you mean the rear edge or the front edge of the door (ie do you want the awning to cover the door)?  In either case, how far back from the front of the trailer do you want the side door (one foot is the minimum;  we can place it anywhere in front of the axles)? Response: The awning should run to the rear edge of the side door. The front edge of the side door should be between 24 and 30 inches from the front of the trailer and it should be a standard size door of approximately 38 inches in width by at least  6 foot high. How many outlets do you want and at what location?  Response: Power outlets, three interior and three exterior.  Interior outlets: The trailer requires three interior 110/120 20 amp duplex outlets. Two of the interior outlets should be on the passenger side up high off the floor by  the flood lights which are located on the exterior of the trailer. The exterior flood lights should be as high on the passenger side of the trailer as possible within approximately 1 foot of the front and back of the trailer. Exterior Outlets: The trailer requires three exterior 110/120 20 amp  duplex outlets. Two of the outlets should be located on the passenger side of the trailer below the exterior halogen lights (approximately 1 foot from the front and 1 foot from the rear of the trailer) at floor level (one by each light).  The third exterior 110/120 20 amp duplex outlet should be  located within approximately one foot of the rear of the trailer on the driver's side. I am not understanding the tie down system, track system or tie rings or both?  Are you requesting an E-track or A-track system? Response: Requesting an E-track system Does the trailer really need a 100 amp  service?  That seems like a lot, could we get by with a 50 amp service. Because then I could provide the shoreline cable, but not with the 100 amp, to much liability. Response:  50 amp service is acceptable.   The due date for quote submission remains 07/21/2005.

<DESC>This amendment changes the contemplated number of awarded contracts from "one" to "one or more"; extends the response date ten days, from August 8, 2005 to August 18, 2005; and changes the delivery location to the Contracting Officer.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

1.  The Project: NOAA has a requirement for LIDAR hydrographic surveying services to support nautical charting and related products for the coastal and adjacent ocean areas of the United States (including possessions and territories), the Great Lakes and other inland navigable waters.  One or more three-year indefinite delivery contract, at an estimated $10 million per year, is scheduled for award in FY 2006 with performance of first work order commencing in 2006.  Work orders under this contract will consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR sounding data; 2) acquiring shoreline and coastal topographic LIDAR; 3) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 4) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, secchi depth readings, etc.); 5) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level correctors to determine the true depths, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 6) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 7) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The final statement of work will tailor these specifications for each work order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.

<SUBJECT>20--PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM (MCS)
<SOLNBR>W56HZV-XX-X-YYYY
<RESPDATE>083005
<ARCHDATE>10292005
<CONTACT>Toni Spalding, (586) 574-8895
<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM (MCS) PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Modular Causeway System (MCS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/ Pr oduct Support Provider (PSP) for the MCS.  In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness and inc reased reliability; enhanced logistics response times, enhanced deployment support, and enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  DEFINITIONS: Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Government, the designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   A PBL Contract: assigns the responsibility for all performance and outcomes to the PBL contractor.  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    pre-determined course of action.  - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership), and refers to both government and civilian agencies.       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.   New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the field/with the unit, at resident schools, or through other military and/or civilian organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support o f fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system.  Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier.  Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. GOALS: Ultimate goal is ultra-availability (readiness).  Our goal is to structure a contract, which      will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  INTENT: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is envisioned to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to five years.  It is our desire to include options for up to five additional years.   The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for a portion of the system logistics support which will be defined in the scope of work, and example of which is supply chain management (parts support) for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in the field . The Army will retain responsibility  for the scheduled and unscheduled organizational unit maintenance of the MCS.  Operator and maintenance training, New Equipment Training (NET), will be the prime contractors (Original Equipment Manufacturer) responsibility.  The system support processes w ill be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for maintaining the MCS configuration, including recommendations(s) and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenanc e. The PSI will be required to negotiate performance arrangements, known also as Performance Based Agreements (PBA), with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.  Examples of PSPs include:  Defense Logistics Agencies (DLA) centers, Army Material Command (AM C), Major Subordinate Command (MSC), Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. DESIRED RESULTS AND OUTCOMES:   Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the MCS System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increased operational readiness (90% or better) by: (a) reducing the logistics footprint; (b) reducing maintenance/repair time s for scheduled and unscheduled direct and general support level maintenance; (c) providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and (d) ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   MEASUREMENTS:  Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation to be further defined in the RFP.  An example would be: - Obtain Mean Time Between Failure(s) (MTBF) data to establish a baseline; continuously work to improve MTBF. - Reduced Logistics Footprint:  provide a measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver Direct and General Support level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization - Reduced Maintenance/Repair times:  Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. - Relief from conducting sustainment training:  Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army PBL SYSTEM CANDIDATES: MCS Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (OpTempo) if avail able.  Wartime scenario includes supporting systems deployed into war zones. MCS Systems anticipated to be supported:      Warping Tug (WT) = 13      Roll-on-Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF) = 5      Causeway Ferry (CF) = 5      Floating Causeway (FC) = 3 MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM PROFILE Modular Causeway System (MCS) Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP) 1.	Concept of Employment.   a. A diverse package of Army Watercraft provides a foundation of theater opening and reception of Army and joint forces committed to Regional Commander in Chiefs (CINCs) under Unified Action, Armed Forces (UNAAF).  The Modular Causeway System is an integr al part of the total Joint Logistics over the Shore (JLOTS) mission.  LOTS missions are the unloading of ships without the benefit of fixed port facilities in either friendly or undefended territory and, in time of war, during phases of theater development .  LOTS operations are conducted over unimproved shoreline, through fixed ports not accessible to deep draft shipping, and through fixed ports that are inadequate without the use of LOTS capabilities. b. The MCS is a theater opening asset.  It will provide a critical link between the offshore arrivals of combat power loaded aboard strategic sealift ships and placing that power ashore in a ready to fight configuration.  The wartime commitment requires de ployment with the pre-position assets of the Army Heavy Brigade Afloat.  The MCS is expected to operate continuously for 90-days to cover force opening and su rge assets.  If there is a second near simultaneous Major Regional Conflict, the MCS will be redeployed to the new area.  It must be restored to full mission capability in transit to that location. c. The MCS is a part of the UNAAF special response force support and may be deployed to Operations Other Than War (OOTW) to include policing actions and humanitarian efforts. d. The MCS is comprised of powered and non-powered floating platforms and will have the following sub-systems:  Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facility (RRDF), Causeway Ferries (CF), Floating Causeways (FC) and the Warping Tug (WT).  Each subsystem will be mad e up of the same modular sections arranged in different configurations.  This will allow commanders greater flexibility in determining the best method of discharge based on the operational situation.  This appendix will use the notional scenario for a mild  sloping beach area as used in the Theater Opening model for the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP).  The same assumptions have been validated with the Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Joint Logistics over the Shore, Joint Publication 4-01 .6 dtd 22 August 1991.  The Joint Mission Area (JMA) Assessment for Maritime Support of Land Forces, Dec 1995 and more recent arrival of the Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll-Off (LMSR) ship have lead to a more robust RRDF platform. e. The MCS sections are made up of several modules with further subdivision into watertight compartments. These modules are interconnected with multiple pins and connection devices.  This redundancy in system construction is built in to preclude catastroph ic failure.  The RRDF and FC platforms are designed for the 90-day continuous operation without repair.  Some temporary patches may be applied to the outer layer of modules if needed.  Support Equipment will require routine service and repairs throughout t he operation. 2.	Missions.  The subassemblies are described below: a. Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facility:  Provides interface platform between a RO/RO ship ramp system and watercraft lighters, as well as, mooring positions and loading platform for other vessels.  This system may be configured as a Force Opening platform of six sections to as great as seventeen sections with two lane drive-through capacity. b. Causeway Ferry:  A ferry, powered by a modular warping tug with a frame, winch and stern anchor removed to allow for drive-through capability.  Its primary purpose is to transfer 20 ft. containers from containerships directly to the beach for offload by  Rough Terrain Container Handlers.  This system may be used to haul rolling stock (wheeled and tracked vehicles) directly to the shore in mild and flat beach gradients.  This, however, is envisioned to be less than 10% of its mission performance.  Normally  once the Floating Causeway is constructed, the highest productivity for the CF is achieved with containers direct to the beach.   c. Floating Causeway:  Provides a docking pier head for simultaneous discharge of more than one lighter.  This subsystem allows unassisted offloading and back loading at beach interface for rolling stock and cargo using Material Handling Equipment.  The sy stem can bridge up to 1500 feet from shore.  Fifteen (15) feet of water depth is required at pier head to accept lighters.  Gentle slope beach gradients may only require as little as four eighty foot sections to be installed. d. Warping Tug:  Self-propelled craft utilized for pushing, pulling, restraining and maneuvering each fully assembled, fully loaded sub-system.  The warping tug shall be used to also emplace and retrieve anchors.  The tug Table will reflect times for insta llation and recovery of the FC, movement of the RRDF to ship ramp discharge sites, and tendering common to both.  The operating times associated with the Causeway Ferry are shown in the WT Table 4b. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM (MCS) Name of Company: Add ress: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: 1.  Describe your companys experience and/or knowledge of providing any/all PBL type(s) of support for commercial watercraft vessels and systems: 2.  Have you successfully performed the in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other Army or DoD system, vessel or vehicle? If so, on which please describe.  What was the extent of the support provided? 3.  If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4.  What would be your business approach to meeting the responsibility for managing the MCS fleet?   Please be sure to address (at a minimum) how/what you propose/recommend:      a. for meeting the goal of ultra-availability      b. for meeting the goal of  reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance (increasing Mean Time Between Failure)?      c. as the approach to supply chain management in support of the MCS fleet, and how would you propose to integrate with the current organic system?        d. as your approach to managing a sustainment training program and reduce the Armys training burden? 5.  Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime versus peacetime situations. 6.  How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 7.  What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipate with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 9.  Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined in this questionnaire are attainable? 10. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support to the U.S. Army under a long-term contract if this effort is pursued?   11.  How would you foresee the target price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Keep in mind that this is a continuous improvement and learning exercise for the government and industry. We do not have all the answers nor do we even know all the right questions.

<DESC>The government is seeking professional design services from an architect-engineering firm to develop working drawings and specifications for construction to replace one existing 800 ton chiller with a new, larger chiller and evaluate the chiller system.  This work includes mechanical and electrical and, potentially, some structural.  The project involves engineering for a new chiller (sized to meet local demands), electrical feeds and electrical equipment.  The project will follow the guidelines established in the VA Pittsburgh Master Space Plan to enhance services at University Drive.  All designs will be compliant with space criteria referenced in VA Handbook 7610.  Design shall incorporate minimal downtime of supplemental chiller to operating rooms.  Existing equipment (electrical, etc.) shall be evaluated to determine if they will be sufficient to remain as part of the entire cooling system.  If not then design shall include necessary provisions to have functional operation room chillers.  The new chiller shall be tied via control system in to the existing computer control system.  All designs shall be accomplished in accordance with VA guidelines and specifications, which are available on the Internet at http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard.  A/E shall pay particular attention to USAF, NSPA, BOCA, VA Handbook 7610 space criteria and VA Program Guide PG-18-14 "Room Finishes, Door and Hardware Schedule".  The architect-engineer will make site visits as necessary to survey existing conditions as required to determine existing as-built conditions affecting this project.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, our allies and friends. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary’s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, we must be able to detect, track, identify and kill that ballistic missile.  In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in both hardware and software.  This push is fundamental to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  We advance technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS capabilities in the far term.  Within MDA, the Advanced Systems Deputate (AS) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing innovative concepts for BMDS integration, and leading the effort to develop algorithms for improving BMDS capability.  The Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program, administered by MDA/AS, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technical improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MDA/AS has instituted the MSTAR Program in order to sponsor fundamental, MDA relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program is a competitive, science and technology university program, which will consist of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches through scientific and technological investigation in the following ten MSTAR topic areas: (1) Sensing, Ranging, Imaging, and Phenomenology, Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Simultaneous Multicolor Focal Plane Arrays; Plasma Antennas, Lightweight Optics, Multi-Sensor Correlation and Integration; (2)Detection, Tracking, Discrimination, Decision Theory, Asset (Sensor and Weapon) Resource Management and Kill Assessment; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Wide-angle Acquisition Sensor for Laser Communications, Precision Relative Position Sensors, Integrated Star-Tracker and Inertial Reference Unit, Bayesian Decision Networks, Optimization; (3)Propulsion Technologies, including novel divert propulsion; (4)  Electronic and Photonic Materials and Devices; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Technologies employing increased IR Cutoff Wavelength; (5)MEMS and Nanotechnologies, Robotics and Microsystems; (6) Directed Energy and Non-Linear Optical Devices and Processes; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  Nanofiber Reinforcement Composite Optics; Lightweight, Movable, Precision, Off-Axis, Parabolic, Calibration Mirrors; (7) Guidance and Control, Platform Technologies, and Kill Enhancement; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:   Miniature Interceptor Technologies, Survivable Lightweight Materials for Operation in Caustic Environments, Low Cost High Performance Gyroscope; (8) Power Generation and Conditioning, Thermal Management; Example MDA Technologies or Interest:  High Voltage Power Amplifiers, Distributed Low-Power Density Apertures, Power Devices Self Protection; (9) Force Protection of Missile Defense Systems and Facilities; (10) Information Processing and Computing Technologies, Human in the Loop (MDA Operations) Intelligence Processing and Decision Making in Near Real Time.  If interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a combined technical and management proposal limited to ten pages, including a one-page executive summary of the technical and management proposal.  The technical and management proposal shall include full discussion of the scope, nature, and objectives of the proposed research effort; rationale for the technical contribution to MDA goals to include identification of the MSTAR topic area the proposal is submitted under; related research efforts performed in the past; a description of and statement of availability of facilities and instrumentation required for performance; a description of management planning and control systems; and identification of limited data rights or computer software, if any.  In addition the offeror must provide the following, exclusive of the ten page limitation: a Statement of Work (SOW) suitable for contract incorporation, and resumes of key personnel; (2) Cost proposal limited to five pages.  The cost proposal shall be submitted as a separate document together with supporting detailed cost data, including subcontractor data, if any.  Offers shall include a summary of the cost proposal at the cost element level (i.e., total direct labor, overhead, general and administrative, etc).  Summaries should also include a funding profile by fiscal year.  Offerors’ proposals shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .PDF file) and should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary information.  All proposals shall remain valid for acceptance by the Government for a period of 180 days.

The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Submission of white papers under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  Award announcements are expected to be made on April 15, 2005.  MDA expects to award four to six contracts during the third or fourth quarter of Fiscal year 2005.  The period of performance for the resultant awards will range from twelve months to thirty-six months with a funding level of $150,000 to $200,000 per contract year.  The contract document, upon award, will include details of the contract deliverables.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION (OST)
	
PROGRAM TITLE:  DOT-WIDE RECORDS MANAGEMENT APPLICATION - PHASE 2 

Name:  Rhonda Robinson, Contracting Officer, DOT, OST
Organization:  Acquisition Services
Region:  DOT Headquarters 
Phone Number:  202-366-6689
Email:  Rhonda.robinson@dot.gov
Date:  August 3, 2005
Industry Reponses Due by:  August 31, 2005
Procurement Method:  Public Announcement

Introduction:
The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) is seeking Records Management Application products.  With this Request For Information (RFI), the OST is seeking Commercial Records Management Application providers assistance in providing information that the DOT may utilize to support the scanning, indexing, storage and  migration of paper records, for DOT-wide implementation, business solution and/or investment decision. 

Background:
The DOT is planning a move to a new Headquarters Building, and as part of a department-wide consolidation process, DOT plans to convert substantial portions of its paper records into an electronic format.  

Statement of Need:
This notice is issued by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), an organization of the DOT OST, as an RFI to solicit responses from interested parties. The OCIO is seeking sources with the ability to recommend and implement a strategy that provides for the identification, evaluation, recommendation, purchase, installation, operation, and support of a Department-wide Records Management Application (RMA) for DOT. 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only, with the intent to allow industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their ideas for the provision of services described below.  This document will also verify reasonableness and feasibility of future program requirements and promote competition.  DOT intends to install 3,500 seats with the RMA over a three (3) year period, 2000 in the first year, and 750 in years two and three.  The 2000 seats and associated services must be in place by February 2007.  DOT is looking for a single Offeror that can provide solutions and support for the issues listed below.  

This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by DOT, nor will DOT pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI. However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating future requirements and an implementation strategy for DOT Records Management program.  A part of that strategy will include other competitive procurements, such as obtaining the actual RMA solution. 

Therefore, the DOT is interested in commercial RMA providers’ review, comments and input on the following: 

Issues to be Addressed:
The Offeror must address the following items:

•	Solicitation/Procurement Document Preparation
The Offeror must identify and state the technical requirements and specifications of DOT pursuant to the process of the preparation and issuance of procurement documents that will allow prospective vendors to respond by offering an appropriate RMA solution.  The Offeror must document the process by which the technical requirements of DOT were determined and incorporated into said procurement documents.  A portion of this task will require the identification of the functional requirements of the several DOT Operating Administrations (OAs) for the Department-wide RMA, as well as the incorporation of related information already obtained by DOT.  The RMA must comply with  DOD 5015.2-STD, and the requirements of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and be consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) for DOT.

•	Solicitation Response Evaluation and Recommendation to DOT for RMA  Acquisition
The Offeror must provide a documented methodology for evaluation of responses received resulting from the above referenced procurement consistent with the needs of DOT as stated in the procurement documents, and make a recommendation to the OCIO, based on all relevant documentation, for acquiring a specific Department-wide RMA solution. The Offeror should provide an estimated cost for the acquisition of the RMA solution, and an explanation of the underlying assumptions that form the basis for stating that price.  A portion of this task will require the Offeror to arrange for and evaluate demonstrations of how the proposed RMA solutions will operate based upon certain work flows of the several DOT OAs.  Moreover, the proposed RMA solution must be consistent with the Enterprise Architecture for DOT and will be reviewed by members of that DOT office prior to purchase or implementation.  The Offeror must not be associated with any RMA solution in any sense that would constitute a conflict of interest by limiting the ability of the Offeror to fairly and objectively evaluate all potential RMA solution proposed.


•	Implementation and Support of Selected RMA
The Offeror must manage and support the chosen RMA in terms of its initial installation onto DOT servers and the DOT network, and in terms of its on-going operation.  A portion of this task will require the identification of work flows of the several DOT OAs for input into the Department-wide RMA, as well as the incorporation of related information already obtained by DOT.  Support for the RMA solution must be integrated into the DOT Information Technology Services support system
	
•	Integration of Selected Records Management Application with Existing Applications
The Offeror must integrate existing Records Management, Document Management, and Content Management applications already in use at DOT, and the contents thereof, into the Department-wide RMA.  Existing applications at DOT may include, but are not limited to, Identitiech, Hummingbird, Documentum, Filenet, and/or Zylabs.  The RMA solution must be compatible with and integrated into the Microsoft Office Suite/Outlook products.  

•	Training of DOT Personnel on Use of the Selected Records Management Application
The Offeror must address the management and support of the provision of training for DOT personnel in the usage of the Department-wide RMA.

•	Loading of Scanned Images
The Offeror must manage and support the loading of scanned images into the Department-wide RMA.  Pursuant to the effort at records reduction, DOT has issued a solicitation for scanning and it is anticipated that the OAs may have several million images of records scanned by the time the RMA is selected.  Those images may be in TIFF, PDF, etc. formats, may be documents with or without OCR, and may or may not be indexed.  While the terms of the scanning procurement will require the vendor providing that service to assist with the loading of the images into the RMA solution that DOT eventually implements, the Offeror here should anticipate a primary role in loading those legacy records into the RMA solution, and provide for loading of newly created records on a “Day 1 Forward” basis.  Consequently, the Offeror must consider the issues of loading and indexing existing records into the selected RMA solution.
 
•	Price and Timeline Information
The Offeror must provide a rough order of magnitude price for each of the items listed above, and provide pricing assumptions along with a proposed time frame for the accomplishment of those items.  As noted above, DOT expects to install the 3,500 seats over a three year period.  As such, the Offeror should provide the rough order of magnitude pricing for each item and the yearly cost for that item over each year of the three year period.  As an example, if the Offeror states “Training” at $4,000 dollars, what would be the cost for Year 1, how much for Year 2, and how much for Year 3?  

Responses must also include the following:  Name and address of firm, size of business using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Veteran, Service Disabled Veteran, and/or Women Owned; whether the Offeror is on GSA Schedule; number of years in business; list of customers covering the past three years. (Highlight relevant work performed).

In summary, the Department-wide RMA must accommodate input, storage, and indexing of a variety of records types, allow for secure authorized access and retrieval of those records based on complex metadata that reflects the business needs of DOT’s modes and offices, must be compatible with similar applications already in use or implemented by DOT modes and offices, must be acceptable to the NARA, and be DOD 5015.2 compliant.

SECURITY NOTICE:
1.	Work under contract may involve access to sensitive information which shall not be disclosed by the contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer.  To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual’s suitability to have such authorization.  Contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the contracting officer. 
2.	The contractor shall ensure that contractor employees are: (1) citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1632.2B, Personnel Security Management.
3.	The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources.
4.	Contractor Responsible for IT Services:  The contactor shall be responsible for IT security for all systems operated by or connected to a DOT network, regardless of location.  This includes any IT resource or services in which the contractor has physical or electronic access to DOT’s sensitive information that directly supports the mission of DOT (e.g. hosting DOT e-government sites or other IT operations).  If necessary, the Government shall have access to contractor and any subcontractor facilities, systems/networks operated on behalf of DOT, documentation, databases, and personnel to carry out a program of IT information (to include vulnerability scanning), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to DOT data or IT systems.
5.	Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor shall develop and provide to the Government for approval, an IT Security Plan which describes the processes and procedures the contractor will follow in performance of said contract to ensure the appropriate security of IT resources developed, processed, or used under said contract.

<SUBJECT>20--Market Survey for the Modular Causeway Systems (MCS)
<SOLNBR>W56HZV-XX-X-YYYY
<RESPDATE>083005
<ARCHDATE>10292005
<CONTACT>Toni Spalding, (586) 574-8895
<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM (MCS) PURPOSE: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Modular Causeway System (MCS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/ Pr oduct Support Provider (PSP) for the MCS.  In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness and inc reased reliability; enhanced logistics response times, enhanced deployment support, and enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  DEFINITIONS: Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Government, the designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   A PBL Contract: assigns the responsibility for all performance and outcomes to the PBL contractor.  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    pre-determined course of action.  - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership), and refers to both government and civilian agencies.       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.   New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the field/with the unit, at resident schools, or through other military and/or civilian organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support o f fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system.  Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier.  Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. GOALS: Ultimate goal is ultra-availability (readiness).  Our goal is to structure a contract, which      will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  INTENT: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is envisioned to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to five years.  It is our desire to include options for up to five additional years.   The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for a portion of the system logistics support which will be defined in the scope of work, an example of which is supply chain management (parts support) for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in the field.   The Army will retain responsibility fo r the scheduled and unscheduled organizational-unit maintenance of the MCS.  Operator and maintenance training, New Equipment Training (NET), will be the prime (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) contractors responsibility.  The system support processe s will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for maintaining the MCS configuration, including recommendation(s) and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintena nce. The PSI will be required to negotiate performance arrangements, known also as Performance Based Agreements (PBA), with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.  Examples of PSPs include:  Defense Logistics Agencies (DLA) centers, Army Material Command (AM C), Major Subordinate Command (MSC), Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. DESIRED RESULTS AND OUTCOMES:   Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the MCS System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increased operational readiness (90% or better) by: (a) reducing the logistics footprint; (b) reducing maintenance/repair time s for scheduled and unscheduled direct and general support level maintenance; (c) providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and (d) ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   MEASUREMENTS:  Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation to be further defined in the RFP.  An example would be: - Obtain Mean Time Between Failure(s) (MTBF) data to establish a baseline; continuously work to improve MTBF. - Reduced Logistics Footprint:  provide a measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver Direct and General Support level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization - Reduced Maintenance/Repair times:  Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. - Relief from conducting sustainment training:  Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army PBL SYSTEM CANDIDATES: MCS Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (OpTempo) if avail able.  Wartime scenario includes supporting systems deployed into war zones. MCS Systems anticipated to be supported: Warping Tug (WT) = 13 Roll-on-Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF) = 5 Causeway Ferry (CF) = 5 Floating Causeway (FC) = 3 MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM PROFILE Modular Causeway System (MCS) Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP) 1.	Concept of Employment.   a.	 A diverse package of Army Watercraft provides a foundation of theater opening and reception of Army and joint forces committed to Regional Commander in Chiefs (CINCs) under Unified Action, Armed Forces (UNAAF).  The Modular Causeway System is an integ ral part of the total Joint Logistics over the Shore (JLOTS) mission.  LOTS missions are the unloading of ships without the benefit of fixed port facilities in either friendly or undefended territory and, in time of war, during phases of theater developmen t.  LOTS operations are conducted over unimproved shoreline, through fixed ports not accessible to deep draft shipping, and through fixed ports that are inadequate without the use of LOTS capabilities. b.	The MCS is a theater opening asset.  It will provide a critical link between the offshore arrivals of combat power loaded aboard strategic sealift ships and placing that power ashore in a ready to fight configuration.  The wartime commitment requires de ployment with the pre-position assets of the Army Heavy Brigade Afloat.  The MCS is expected to operate continuously for 90-days to cover force opening and surge assets.  If the re is a second near simultaneous Major Regional Conflict, the MCS will be redeployed to the new area.  It must be restored to full mission capability in transit to that location. c.	The MCS is a part of the UNAAF special response force support and may be deployed to Operations Other Than War (OOTW) to include policing actions and humanitarian efforts. d.	The MCS is comprised of powered and non-powered floating platforms and will have the following sub-systems:  Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facility (RRDF), Causeway Ferries (CF), Floating Causeways (FC) and the Warping Tug (WT).  Each subsystem will be mad e up of the same modular sections arranged in different configurations.  This will allow commanders greater flexibility in determining the best method of discharge based on the operational situation.  This appendix will use the notional scenario for a mild  sloping beach area as used in the Theater Opening model for the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP).  The same assumptions have been validated with the Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Joint Logistics over the Shore, Joint Publication 4-01 .6 dtd 22 August 1991.  The Joint Mission Area (JMA) Assessment for Maritime Support of Land Forces, Dec 1995 and more recent arrival of the Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll-Off (LMSR) ship have lead to a more robust RRDF platform. e.	The MCS sections are made up of several modules with further subdivision into watertight compartments. These modules are interconnected with multiple pins and connection devices.  This redundancy in system construction is built in to preclude catastroph ic failure.  The RRDF and FC platforms are designed for the 90-day continuous operation without repair.  Some temporary patches may be applied to the outer layer of modules if needed.  Support Equipment will require routine service and repairs throughout t he operation. 2.	Missions.  The subassemblies are described below: a.	Roll-On/Roll-Off Discharge Facility:  Provides interface platform between a RO/RO ship ramp system and watercraft lighters, as well as, mooring positions and loading platform for other vessels.  This system may be configured as a Force Opening platform of six sections to as great as seventeen sections with two lane drive-through capacity. b.	Causeway Ferry:  A ferry, powered by a modular warping tug with a frame, winch and stern anchor removed to allow for drive-through capability.  Its primary purpose is to transfer 20 ft. containers from containerships directly to the beach for offload by  Rough Terrain Container Handlers.  This system may be used to haul rolling stock (wheeled and tracked vehicles) directly to the shore in mild and flat beach gradients.  This, however, is envisioned to be less than 10% of its mission performance.  Normally  once the Floating Causeway is constructed, the highest productivity for the CF is achieved with containers direct to the beach.   c.	Floating Causeway:  Provides a docking pier head for simultaneous discharge of more than one lighter.  This subsystem allows unassisted offloading and back loading at beach interface for rolling stock and cargo using Material Handling Equipment.  The sy stem can bridge up to 1500 feet from shore.  Fifteen (15) feet of water depth is required at pier head to accept lighters.  Gentle slope beach gradients may only require as little as four eighty foot sections to be installed. d.	Warping Tug:  Self-propelled craft utilized for pushing, pulling, restraining and maneuvering each fully assembled, fully loaded sub-system.  The warping tug shall be used to also emplace and retrieve anchors.  The tug Table will reflect times for insta llation and recovery of the FC, movement of the RRDF to ship ramp discharge sites, and tendering common to both.  The operating times associated with the Causeway Ferry are shown in the WT Table 4b. . PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE MODULAR CAUSEWAY SYSTEM (MCS) Name of Company: Address: City, Sta te, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: 1.  Describe your companys experience and/or knowledge of providing any/all PBL type(s) of support for commercial watercraft vessels and systems: 2.  Have you successfully performed the in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other Army or DoD system, vessel or vehicle? If so, on which please describe.  What was the extent of the support provided? 3.  If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4.  What would be your business approach to meeting the responsibility for managing the MCS fleet?   Please be sure to address (at a minimum) how/what you propose/recommend:      a. for meeting the goal of ultra-availability      b. for meeting the goal of  reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance (increasing Mean Time Between Failure)?      c. as the approach to supply chain management in support of the MCS fleet, and how would you propose to integrate with the current organic system?        d. as your approach to managing a sustainment training program and reduce the Armys training burden? 5.  Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime versus peacetime situations. 6.  How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 7.  What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipate with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 9.  Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined in this questionnaire are attainable? 10. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support to the U.S. Army under a long-term contract if this effort is pursued?   11.  How would you foresee the target price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Keep in mind that this is a continuous improvement and learning exercise for the government and industry. We do not have all the answers nor do we even know all the right questions.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers is developing an acquisition plan for the construction of a new lock at Sault Ste. Marie, Mi., a project expected to cover a number of years and cost multi millions of dollars.  We are seeking information about interested prime  contractors, subcontractors and suppliers of construction materials such as steel, stone, concrete, pumps and other supplies that may be needed to operate the lock.  Please note that we are in a planning stage and this is a market survey. There is no soli citation and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement. Interested firms should provide a summary of their capabilities, business size and socio economic status e.g., large business, small business, small disad vantaged, disabled veteran. Responses should be sent to Detroit District, Corps of Engineers, attn: George Fedynsky, 477 Michigan Ave. Room 617, Detroit Michigan 48226-2550 or emailed to george.fedynsky@lre02.usace.army.mil. In the St. Marys River at Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, there are four parallel locks.  Three of the locks are operational.  Only the Poe lock has the length, width and depth to accommodate all Greta Lakes Vessels.  The MacArther Lock has the depth but neithe r the length nor width required by some vessels.  The Davis and the Sabin Locks are old and deteriorated and have neither the width nor depth for the contemporary commercial Great Lakes cargo vessels. The government intends to replace the Sabin and Davis lock with a new Poe Class Lock.  The following provides a brief description of the proposed new Poe-Class Lock. Approach Walls- The approach procedure for lake vessel is to align itself with an approach wall.  The existing Sabin Lock approach walls will be used for both the upbound and downbound traffic.  To be effectively used as approach walls for the new Poe-Clas s lock, upgrading of the existing approach walls is required.  The downstream, north approach wall upgrade will consist of a combination of precast concrete wall panels and 30-foot diameter steel sheet pile cells with a combined length of 1814 linear feet.   The downstream, south approach wall upgrade will consist of 1250 linear feet of 30-foot diameter steel sheet pile cells tapered from the new lock into the existing center pier.  The upstream, north approach wall will consist of 2480 lineal feet of 30-foo t diameter steel sheet pile cells.  The approach wall is offset 30 feet south of the existing approach wall to allow vessels to clear the existing bascule bridge.  The upstream, south approach wall will consist of 735 linear feet of 30-foot diameter steel sheet pile cells tapered from the new lock into the existing east center pier. Lock Chamber-The new lock chamber will consist of the north and south camber walls, miter gate area lock walls, lock chamber floor, upstream and downstream miter gates and an emergency closure system.  The north chamber wall will incorporate the Sabin Lock  existing monoliths.  Five feet of the old concrete will be removed from the top and sides of the monoliths and replaced with 10 feet of new concrete.  A precast concrete skirt wall will be constructed to accommodate the chamber deepening.  The south chamb er wall will be a completely new monolith founded on bedrock.  The bedrock elevation is higher then the lock chamber floor.  Precast concrete skirt walls will be constructed from the bottom of the monoliths to the chamber floor.  Stability of the precast s kirt walls will be obtained by using rock anchors.  The miter gate monoliths include the emergency closure/bulkhead, fender boom monoliths, and miter gate monoliths.  The new lock chamber concrete floor will be built approximately 10 feet below the existin g Sabin Lock floor to accommodate the Poe-Class vessels.  The filling and emptying system is to be constructed beneath the lock chamber floor.  The lock chamber will have a single upstream and downstream miter gate.  These gates will each consi st of two horizontal framed leaves of welded construction, 62 feet 11 inches long between contact points.  The height of the upstream leaves is 38.2 feet and the height of the downstream leaves is 59.9 feet from top of sill to top of lock wall.  The fillin g and emptying system will consist of an intake manifold, culvert filling and emptying system valves, culvert ports and outlet manifold.  Multiple culverts are placed side by side to span the entire width of the chamber floor with corresponding port config uration similar to the current Davis and Sabin systems.  Four, 12-foot by 12-foot butterfly valves located on the upstream and downstream miter gate sills control the flow through the culvert system. North Canal Deepening- The north canal is the approach to the new lock chamber.  The existing project depth of the north canal, upstream approach is 24.3 feet while the existing project depth of the north canal, downstream approach, is 23.1 feet.  The nort h canal upstream and downstream approaches will be deepened to 29.0 and 28.5 feet respectively.  The canal deepening will consist of removal of both loose overburden material and bedrock.  It is anticipate that underwater blasting will be required for bedr ock removal.  It is estimated that the canal deepening will require the removal and disposal of 258,000 cubic yards of overburden and bedrock. Disposal areas  There are two disposal sites for the disposal of the canal deepening and lock chamber excavation material.  The first is the backfilling of the existing Davis Lock.  The second is a spoil site located behind the northwest pier.  The rock e xcavation will be placed up to 10 feet below the top of the lock.  The next 8 feet will be filled with common excavation and the final 2 feet with topsoil.  The remaining material will be placed at the spoil site located behind the northwest pier.  It is e stimated that the site can accommodate 1.7 million cubic yards of spoil material placed at a height ranging from 33 feet on the east side to 84 feet on the west side. It is proposed that the project be constructed in three phases.  Phase 1 would be the construction of the cofferdams. Phase 2 would be the construction of the approach walls and canal deepening.  Phase 3 would be the construction of the lock chamber. It is  estimated that the lock chamber construction duration is seven years.

<SUBJECT>A -- NUCLEOFECTOR TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, Maryland, for a Nucleofector Technology. The Nucleofector concept uses a unique combination of electrical parameters and cell-type specific Nucleofector solutions.  Based on this combination, the Nucleofectory Technology is the first efficient routine method for non-viral gene transfer into primary cells and hard-to-transfect cell lines.  In addition, the Nucleofector Technology to date is unique in its ability to transfer DNA directly into the cell nucleus.  The Nucleofector technology thus enables gene transfer into mecially highly relevant cell types with in many cases unprecedented efficiencies.  CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. However, information received will be considered solely for information purposes only. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Beth West at llw5@cdc.gov.

If your business responded to that instance of the RFI, please do not respond to this one.**** External organizations are sought to support Quest Challenges, the outreach element of Centennial Challenges (www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov) within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (www.exploration.nasa.gov) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  These organizations will help with the planning, coordination, and execution of the following elements as they relate to individual Quest Challenges: • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Outreach Plan Development • Challenge Formulation • Partner Organization Recruitment • Challenge Information • Challenge Administration • Challenge Event Management • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Impact Assessment It is expected that this effort would consist of a competitively bid contract, augmented by partnerships with educational institutions and other organizations (relevant non-profits, primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, professional organizations, and other organizations).  This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to identify the field of possible supporting organizations based on the responses received and to obtain information that will help guide the development of future procurements.  Please respond to any or all of the RFI elements provided below. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES OVERVIEW NASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions in support of the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  Centennial Challenges is modeled on past and ongoing prize competitions, including the 18th century British Longitude Prize; early 20th century aviation competitions, such as the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh; the ongoing Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge; and the recently won, privately funded, Ansari X PRIZE.  By making awards based on actual achievements instead of proposals, Centennial Challenges seeks novel and lower-cost solutions to engineering obstacles in civil space and aeronautics from new sources of innovation in industry, academia, and the public. There will be four categories of competitions conducted by Centennial Challenges, one of which is covered in this RFI – Quest Challenges.  The Alliance Challenge category is covered in a separate “Announcement of Partnership Opportunity”.  The other two Challenge categories, Flagship and Keystone, are covered in a separate RFI. QUEST CHALLENGES Quest Challenges are intended to complement other Challenge categories by promoting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) awareness, subjects, and careers to youth and to other age groups who are not involved in STEM careers.  It is envisioned that Quest Challenges, categorized by and targeted at different age groups, will be inspirational and enriching.  Some Quest Challenges will involve individual or group activities, repeatable contests, or submission of entries for judging.	NASA hopes to offer cash prizes in the hundreds to thousands of dollars, or equivalent awards of interest to youth or other age groups. The support contractor for Quest Challenges will have a large role in the creation and design of specific Quest Challenges, but examples include: • Relevant student engineering Challenges, such as model rocket or robotic competitions; • Relevant student science competitions, such as the Intel Science Talent Search;  • Naming and/or logo design contests for individual Flagship, Keystone, or Alliance Challenges; • Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-related games and tournaments, such as internet-based games, card games, and video games; and • “Best Science/Science Fiction” Challenges in literature, art, and/or music. NASA anticipates that most Quest Challenges will be administered via no-cost partnerships between the Quest Challenge support contractor and youth and senior institutions and organizations (groups, clubs, non-profit organizations, primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, etc.) to ensure broad engagement and to maintain low overhead costs. However, a support subcontractor may conduct the administration of some highly visible Quest Challenges or internet-based Challenges. SUBMISSION DETAILS Given the background provided above, describe your organization’s experiences, capabilities, and ideas for supporting Quest Challenges.  Where a more complete set of support functions can be provided, partnering between organizations is encouraged.  Joint submissions between two or more potential partnered organizations are welcome. Attachment A provides a description of the anticipated support functions for Quest Challenges. Attachment B provides a list of general questions that may be used to structure future procurements for Quest Challenge contract support. Your organization’s submission may be used by the Government to determine the degree of interest in the industry and capabilities for planning purposes.  Submissions to this request shall be limited to no more than 15 pages, including attachments.  Submissions in response to this RFI should be made electronically in the body of or as an attachment to an email sent to Cheryl.D.Lee@nasa.gov.  All submissions must be received by August 16, 2005 at 3:00 p.m. EDT. Questions regarding this RFI should be directed to: Cheryl Lee NASA Headquarters Procurement Office Code 210.H Greenbelt, MD 20771 All questions must be in writing, either via FAX or e-mail. No telephone calls will be accepted.  ATTACHMENT A: SUPPORT FUNCTIONS FOR QUEST CHALLENGES Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Outreach Plan Development Quest Challenges are the main inspirational and enriching outreach portion of NASA’s Centennial Challenges program. It is very important that this category of Challenges make a measurable impact on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) awareness, subjects, and careers to youth and to other age groups who are not involved in STEM careers.

Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following: • What are some potential STEM impacts that Quest Challenges could be designed to address? • How should these STEM impacts be measured?  Are there low-cost ways of making such measurements? • What are examples of potential Quest Challenges that could be conducted to support these STEM impacts? Challenge Formulation The Quest Challenge Formulation function involves development and review of rules and other details of individual Quest Challenges. It is anticipated that support contractor(s) will play a significant role in guiding the formulation of individual challenges from initial concept to final rules release. NASA anticipates that Quest Challenges support contractor(s) will be especially involved in: • Gathering and generating ideas for Quest Challenges through external and internal inputs; • Defining and refining individual Quest Challenge candidates selected by NASA through reviews, especially to ensure they are consistent with the STEM Outreach Plan; and • Defining responsibilities of partner organizations that will be responsible for conducting Quest Challenge competitions, if any. It is anticipated that Quest Challenge rules and details will include (but are not limited to): • Eligibility criteria (such as student status or age groupings),  • Criteria for winning the Challenge, • Judging methodology (as needed), • Competition locations (as needed), • Competition dates (as needed), • Purse size or other STEM-related prize, and • Relevant supporting material (as needed). Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following: • What are the best methods for gathering challenge ideas targeted at different age groups (e.g., youth and senior)? • What are the best methods for defining rules and other Quest Challenge details? • What are the best methods for reviewing and refining challenge rules so they are enriching and inspirational; transparent, unbiased, and fair; and cannot be cheated? • What are the best methods for identifying independent, qualified reviewers for Quest Challenge rules? • Where needed, what are the best methods for identifying unbiased, qualified judges for individual Quest Challenges? • What are the best ways to identify likely overhead costs for individual Quest Challenges during the formulation process? • What steps can be taken during the formulation process to keep Quest Challenge overhead costs low? Partner Organization Recruitment The Partner Organization Recruitment function seeks to ensure that a substantial and diverse number of organizations will be conducting Quest Challenges to maximize the number of individuals reached and the impact of Quest Challenges.  Under this function, NASA anticipates that Quest Challenges support contractor(s) would be responsible for, or play a significant role in: • Identifying desirable, likely, and/or other relevant partners for a specific Quest Challenges; • Creating Challenge information and materials targeted at potential partner organizations; • Identifying dissemination methods that target potential partner organizations; • Disseminating information and materials to potential partner organizations; • Discussing Challenges with potential partner organizations and answering their questions about Challenge rules and other details; and • Potentially assisting with negotiation and registration of potential partner organizations, including the signature of draft agreements provided by NASA. Areas that should be addressed in your response to this RFI should include, but not be limited to the following: • What are the best methods for identifying potential partner organizations? • What are the best methods for making potential partner organizations aware of a Quest Challenge? • What are the best methods for encouraging potential partner organizations to conduct a particular Quest Challenge?

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation (Request for Proposal) number is AB133C-05-RP-1231.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710 and the corresponding size standard is $500 employees. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2005-04.   The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity fixed price contract.   This requirement is a total small business set-aside.
STATEMENT OF WORK.   Background. The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS, or Sanctuary) annually collects bottom infauna and epibenthic samples to determine the composition of benthic communities, to classify benthic habitats and communities and to evaluate benthic recovery in areas of disturbance.  This contract is to identify, enumerate and weigh (biomass) benthic organisms collected in bottom samples and epibenthic collections and to create a reference or voucher collection for the Sanctuary.  The bottom samples have been or shall be collected by the Sanctuary using potentially different methods (Smith-McIntyre, Shipek, van Veen, slurp gun, suction sampler, box core, scraper, or hand picked) depending on the sediment type and the vehicle used for collection (shipboard, Remotely Operated Vehicle [ROV], submersible, SCUBA or intertidal collection).  The bottom samples shall be preprocessed by the Sanctuary, such that the contractor receives samples sieved through a 1mm mesh screen and preserved first in buffered formalin and then transferred to 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA).  On occasion, specimens may be fixed in alcohol with no use of formalin, depending on the species.  The contractor may specify alternative preservation for samples not yet collected by the Sanctuary. Scope of Work.  The samples shall be further sorted as necessary and identified to the lowest practical taxa level, generally to species, except for oligochaetes, chaetoderms, nematodes and copepods.  The age class of the organism should be specified, the organisms enumerated, and for some of the task orders, the biomass recorded.  Biomass measurements, when requested, shall be taken for each sample, other than individual epifaunal samples, and recorded for key groups:  polychaetes; bivalves, gastropods, other molluscs; asteroids, ophiuroids, echinoids, holothuroids, crinoids; crustaceans; remaining taxa.  Biomass will be measured in grams wet weight and mollusc measurements will be made with the shell.  The contractor will provide the data electronically and in hard copy (two copies) to the Sanctuary.  Electronic files shall be provided in Excel, Access, as an ASCII delineated file, or in another mutually agreed upon software/format.  The file will contain the following information:  Sanctuary sample number, replicate number (if applicable), contractor sample number (if applicable), lowest taxa identification, count, age, and taxonomist.  In addition, OCNMS will provide a  reference table with the full classification of organisms identified thus far, providing the phylum, class, subclass, order, family, genus, species and NODOC#.  To date, more than 300 bottom grab or suction samples from the Sanctuary have been processed and the organisms identified.  This list can be provided prior to award if desired. With each set of data the contractor shall update the reference table provided by OCNMS and clearly indicate the changes made to OCNMS.  Additions shall include the full classification and NODOC#.  One to three pages of text will accompany the data stating observations made regarding the samples.  For instance, this may include recommendations for future sampling in terms of preservatives, sample containers, condition of the organisms, sample labeling, etc.  It should also include a discussion of any new species found, and an explanation of the electronic file format.  Requests to use the data for purposes other than outlined in this solicitation must be approved by the Sanctuary in advance and in writing. Quality control (QC) of the sample sorting and identification shall follow Puget Sound Estuarine Program (PSEP) protocols.  The taxonomists conducting the initial identifications and those performing the QC will be named for each taxa.  A record of the QC results shall be provided with each sample set.  A reference or voucher collection shall be established by the contractor and provided to the Sanctuary with advice on maintaining the reference collection.  A list of the vouchers OCNMS currently has in place will be provided at the time of award, so as not to duplicate efforts regarding the vouchers.
For each reference specimen, attempts to include at least three intact individuals of the species should be made.  Each species with multiple individuals will be in a unique container with a label both inside and outside the bottle.  A catalog of the vouchers should be provided that lists the genus, species, date collected, sample number reference and the taxonomist making the identification, a note on current preservation should be provided, as well as the number of organisms in the voucher.  Sample containers and fixative for the reference collection shall be provided by the contractor, and should be plastic. The organisms identified that are not part of the voucher collection will be returned to the Sanctuary.  All organisms from a sample at the lowest level they were sorted to (at a minimum within a phylum) will be placed in a single jar.  Sample jars not used for vouchers or returning samples shall be returned clean to the Sanctuary.  Disposal of the preservatives and/or remaining sample material is the responsibility of the contractor.  The Sanctuary will deliver the samples to the contractor in sample jars.  The Sanctuary shall be notified in advance of any changes in taxonomists over the course of the contract.  
PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Sixty months from date of award.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

After three years of negotiations, Sudan’s government and main rebel group in Southern Sudan (Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army – SPLM/A) signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9, 2005 to end more than 21 years of civil war.  But as Khartoum makes peace on one front, another violent conflict persists in Western Sudan.

Open warfare erupted in Darfur in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked military installations.  The rebels, who seek an end to the region’s chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias (“Jingaweit”) recruited among groups of Arabic extraction.  Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings, and massive displacement.

The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the first order.  According to the UN’s Humanitarian Profile (# 9 – dated Dec. 1, 2004) an estimated 2.39 million people are displaced out of a population of 6.5 million within Darfur, and more than 200,000 have crossed the border into neighboring Chad.

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is heavily engaged in addressing this ongoing humanitarian crisis.  In FY 2004, USAID provided more than $186 million in support of humanitarian programs in Darfur, Sudan.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) plays a central role in the U.S. Government’s (USG) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  DOS positions require general expertise in humanitarian assistance and disaster response operations, and incumbents are responsible for assisting in the development of response strategies, all aspects of grant management for humanitarian donor organizations, and in the preparation of talking points, information products, and briefing materials.

<DESC>The Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration is the primary road-builder for the National Park Service, Forest Service, Wildlife Refuges, and several other government agencies.  The roads constructed or rehabilitated by Federal Lands are generally low to medium volume roads.  

Rockery walls also known as Dry Stack walls are gravity walls that typically use rough onsite rocks stacked in an interlocking fashion with no mortar, concrete, or steel to retain cut or fill slopes. They are non-invasive and inexpensive wall types, and aesthetically they blend well into natural settings.  

A rationally based and tested design procedure is needed to provide designers and owners with the confidence that these structures can be used in modern highway engineering.  Additionally, since these walls are assembled in-place in the field with local materials, appropriate construction materials, procedures, documentation and contract language needs to be established.  

Major tasks required are as follows:  Review Standard of Design and Construction Practice and of Performance of Existing Walls; Prepare Design Guidelines; Prepare Construction and Maintenance Guidelines; Prepare A Final Report and an Implementation Plan.

STATEMENT OF WORK
	
Facilities Operator/Animal Caretaker
Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit


The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has sixteen (16) horses and can go up to twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit’s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. Below are some items that have been identified that would facilitate the agent’s ability to remain in the field to perform his/her duties in support of the Border Patrol’s mission.  Employing a contractor would be more cost effective in maintaining the facility and the horses.  This would allow the agents to dedicate a greater majority of their time in the field by eliminating the requirement to have agents maintain the facility and the horses.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide a facility operator/animal caretaker service at the specified site. A contractor would also be responsible for providing a minimum of disability insurance and other benefits, as prescribed by the U.S. Department of Labor, to the employees. A minimum of two (2) full time and one (1) part time operator/caretakers is required to maintain coverage throughout the entire week.  This will also cover for holidays, sick days and vacation time for the contract employees.  

Contract employees would be available between the hours of 4:00 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. in order to facilitate other businesses such as farrier services, veterinary services and other responsibilities as dictated by the unit supervisor.  One operator/caretaker would work a 4:00 A.M. – 12:30 P.M. shift and the other would work an 8:00 A.M. - 4:30 P.M. shift each alternating with a .30 minute break for lunch and two .15 minute breaks.

Facility Operator/Animal Caretaker:

Facility operator(s)/animal caretaker(s) must perform all work in person and on-site (individuals will work 8 hours per day/ 7 days per week between the hours of 4:00 A.M. and 4:30 P.M.. 

Be physically present while all contracted services are being performed (i.e. veterinary, farrier service)

Clean/maintain corral area and stalls/tack room/storage area daily (to include feed bins and water troughs, and removal of manure from the premises)

Perform tack maintenance to insure that all equipment is clean and serviceable

Maintain a daily log of all prescribed services and activities and report any abnormalities to the horse patrol supervisor or agent-in-charge

Responsible for cleaning of Horse Patrol Fleet, which includes vehicles and horse trailers (individual is not authorized to operate patrol vehicles)

Operator/caretaker will be responsible for cleaning up the camp grounds on a daily basis.

Feed horses daily (twice) as prescribed by the unit’s feeding/nutrition schedule.  Horses will be fed at 4:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M.

Groom/wash horses to maintain a clean coat daily.

Treat/clean minor abrasions/galls as needed.

Horses not being used for patrol duty will be removed from stalls and put into a designated exercise area at the beginning of the day and returned to the stalls prior to the end of the day.

All horses will be returned to their stalls at the end of the day.

Note:  (1) Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence or carelessness of the facility operator/animal caretaker.  The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence or carelessness on a case-by-case basis.  (2)  Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

The contract awardee will perform horse farrier services according to the below Statement of Work for Douglas Border Patrol Station.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Farrier Services
Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit

The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has sixteen and can have up to twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit’s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. 

The station does not currently have a designated or contracted farrier to provide shoeing for the horses in the remuda.  Employing a contractor would eliminate the need for the unit supervisor to seek out a farrier every five to eight weeks to shoe the station’s horses.  A contract farrier would be held accountable for a guarantied work product whereas a non-contract farrier limits his work to a very limited guaranty and would most likely charge a mileage fee to refit a shoe.  A disadvantage noted in soliciting a different farrier every shoeing cycle is that the farrier does not have the opportunity to “learn” each horse and become familiar with its shoeing needs.  This lends itself to many an animal becoming lame, thus being placed out of service until it heals.  Some injuries due to lameness can permanently disable an animal, costing the agency in veterinary services and ultimately having to replace the animal.

The advantages to having a contract farrier is that he/she would become familiar with each of the animals and have an understanding of each of their shoeing needs.  A contract farrier would be required to comply with standards established by the agency or risk losing the contract award.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide services at a specified site. 

The following are minimum requirements for farrier services:

Farrier:

·	Shoe horses every five to eight weeks by certified farrier. (Farrier should possess a certificate from a recognized Farrier Training Facility)

·	If  a shoe is lost – replacement will be in a timely manner (within 24 hours)

·	The farrier shall perform his/her work between the hours of 7:00am – 5:00pm, Monday through Friday.

·	Shall correct any discrepancies noted, as directed by the COTR, within a three day period after receipt of services at no additional cost to the Government

·	Shall maintain an approved Hoof Management and Maintenance Schedule (Final approval on any maintenance schedule shall be approved by the unit supervisor.)

·	Shall have a minimum of three years experience at a journeyman level and be in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence within a two-day period after Farrier service. The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence.
(2)	Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FRA Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.  The NAICS Code is 541611.  The small business size standard is $6,000,000.  This is a Firm Fixed Price contract for a period of four (4) months from the date of contract award.  INTRODUCTION:  The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is seeking to hire a Contractor to evaluate the valuation routines currently used in its Net Portfolio Value (NPV) Model for the following instruments: fixed-rate single-family, first mortgage loans and securities, adjustable-rate single-family, first mortgage loans and securities, mortgage loan servicing rights, mortgage servicing done by others, mortgage-related escrow deposits, and mortgage-related commitments (the “subject instruments”.)   The NPV Model is a comprehensive interest rate risk model that was developed by OTS in 1991 to monitor the interest rate exposures of thrift institutions. It was subsequently upgraded in 1993 to provide more precise valuations of selected financial instruments, including adjustable-rate mortgages and financial derivatives.  The NPV Model consists of approximately 250 Fortran 77 programs and a small number of SAS programs that are run on an Alpha server.  OTS is currently in the process of porting these programs to Fortran 90 and PC SAS for use in a Windows environment.  The NPV Model uses two cash flow-based techniques to value financial instruments:  a static discounted cash flow approach and an option-based pricing approach based on Monte Carlo simulation.  In addition, a version of the Black-Scholes model (Black (1976)) is used to value certain financial derivatives, such as interest rate caps, floors, and swaptions.  The NPV Model conducts a type of scenario analysis known as stress testing on a quarterly basis to measure the sensitivity of thrifts’ balance sheets to different interest rate shocks.   At the end of each quarter, approximately 850 thrift institutions are required to report to OTS the outstanding balances of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts held in their portfolios. These data, along with the maturities, coupon rates, and re-pricing frequencies for the various financial instruments, are reported on Schedule CMR (Consolidated Maturity and Rate). In order to keep the reporting burden at a minimum, the data on Schedule CMR are reported at an aggregated level.  The information reported on Schedule CMR is used to produce an institution-specific Interest Rate Risk Exposure Report.  This report is made available to each institution on a confidential basis, and is also used by OTS to assess the overall quality and effectiveness of an institution’s interest rate risk management process.  In its current configuration, the NPV Model consists of a “front-end” and a “back-end” process. The front-end is where the quarter-end market data are collected and processed for use by the back-end in producing Interest Rate Risk Exposure Reports for individual thrifts.  One important set of outputs generated by the front-end are price tables that are used to value the subject instruments. SCOPE OF WORK:  The Contractor will conduct a zero-based review of the current valuation methodology for the subject instruments.  The deliverable product will be a comprehensive report that contains an overall assessment of OTS’s data collection and pricing process and includes specific findings and recommendations.  A draft of the report shall be submitted to OTS for review and comments ten (10) days prior to submitting the final version.   Among the issues that the report should address are: -valuation accuracy for the subject instruments due to the current level of aggregation for the data reported on Schedule CMR; - the inclusion of other data relating to fixed-rate and adjustable-rate single-family mortgage loans, securities, and other mortgage-related instruments that should be reported on Schedule CMR; - whether additional financial instruments should be reported on Schedule CMR and valued by the NPV Model, such as interest-only, jumbo and sub prime mortgages; - the optimal levels of data aggregation for Schedule CMR; - interest rate indices that should be added to the pricing routines for adjustable-rate mortgage loans and securities; - the appropriateness of the NPV Model’s current two-factor interest rate process, single-family mortgage prepayment models and Monte Carlo simulation routines; - the feasibility of using CUSIP numbers to value mortgage-related securities (such as Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, IOs, and POs) for approximately 850 OTS-regulated thrifts; and the feasibility of replacing the price-table approach with one that relies on dynamic or “on-the-fly” calculations in the back-end of the NPV Model. As part of the report, the Contractor will be required to provide a prototype data collection form based on its recommendations.  This form should be in a format acceptable to both the Contractor and OTS (e.g., Excel) and should focus on the data needed to value the subject financial instruments. It should be noted that this form is not intended to replace Schedule CMR.  In making recommendations regarding a new data collection process for the subject instruments, the Contractor should be aware of OTS’s desire not to increase the reporting burden on the thrift industry.  As such, OTS is willing to accept a certain degree of valuation difference in exchange for a simplified and non-burdensome data collection process.  In connection with this project, OTS will provide the Contractor with an on-site demonstration of how the NPV Model currently works, and may, upon request, provide the Contractor access to NPV Model source code on an as needed basis.  The recommendations in the Contractor’s report should address whether and by what means OTS should enhance or replace the current valuation process for the subject instruments.  More specifically, the report should address whether the current in-house approach should be enhanced, or if a risk management platform (tool or system) should be purchased from a third-party. Approximate cost estimates for each approach should be provided in the report. A copy of the manual describing the NPV Model and reporting instructions for Schedule CMR may be accessed on the OTS web site at http://www.ots.treas.gov./ .  The total time anticipated for this project is four (4) months from the award date.  BIDDING INFORMATION:   Prospective bidders should pay particular attention to Chapter Five of the NPV Model manual, which provides a detailed description of the approach used to produce the front-end price tables used in valuing the mortgage-related instruments discussed above.  In addition, Bidders should also be familiar with Schedule CMR and the Electronic Filing Software (EFS) used by thrifts to file their CMR data to OTS.  OTS expects the following of the successful Contractor:  an in-depth understanding of the NPV Model and its process for valuing fixed-rate and adjustable-rate single-family mortgage loans, securities, and other mortgage-related instruments using the option-adjusted approach; an in-depth understanding of the residential mortgage market in the United States; a recognized industry leader in both financial modeling and residential mortgage prepayment modeling; and must have a demonstrated track record of working with U.S. regulated financial institutions.  The anticipated maximum overall cost of this project will not exceed $100,000.   The provisions of FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial (Jan 2005), applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 2005) also apply, with the evaluation based on Factor 1- Past Performance and References; Factor 2 – Prior Experience; and Factor 3 – Price. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value.  FAR 212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications – Commercial Items (Jan 2005) shall be complied with through the on-line Reps & Certs process.  FAR 212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (Oct 2003), is also applicable.  Plus FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (Jan 2005), applies.  Offerors must comply with FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration.

<DESC>The following item will be procured: The following equipment will be used as teaching aids and data collection machines at a university.  The following are our specific needs and a brief description of the equipment:  1st NEED:  An educational sized heat exchanger unit that can be remotely run via the internet.   Similar capabilities of the HT30XC, is the only known  remote access Heat Exchanger teaching system currently available and was designed to meet the growing demand of distance learning programs at the university level.  The unit is a self-contained bench top service unit with remote access, web enabled capability that will accept four different industrial type heat exchangers including, Tubular, Plate, Shell & Tube and Jacketed vessel.  Also, will accept a user provided heat exchanger for student project work.  The service unit provides all the necessary services to run the experiments, including: Circulating hot water with PID control of temperature, instrumentation to measure the temperature and flow rates of the hot and cold fluids.  The systems allows the equipment to be operated remotely, such as over a Local Area Network (LAN) or even over the internet. The unit has to be designed to ensure that it shuts down safely in the event of a communications failure.  Once the heat exchanger has been installed and configured, all the controls to perform a series of investigations are under software control, and so the student does not need to be present with the equipment.  

2nd NEED: An educational sized water flow bench that has software compatible to other pieces of equipment  in an educational lab a foundational teaching unit for fluids with experiments that build student knowledge to a level at which they are ready move onto the F1-10.  The literature and equipment are designed in a manner to provide seamless transition from one unit to the other. 

 3rd NEED: A hydrostatics bench that is compatible with the F1-10 Hydrodynamic Bench. 

4th NEED: A “turn key system” engine and dynamometer that is able to be linked up to a computer system. The whole system is designed to be linked to a computer using the software provided. The software provides real time monitoring of the various sensors, with a wide range of data logging and graphical display options. The dynamometer and throttle can both be controlled electronically from the software, which makes installation into a closed test cell very straightforward, and allows for remote computer operation. A safety ‘watchdog’ facility ensures the system shuts down safely in the event of computer failure or software lock-ups. The interfaces are compatible with packages such as LabView and MatLab for users who wish to provide their own control and monitoring software. A further advantage of the computer control is that stable rpm readings can be easily achieved using the closed loop control function on the dynamometer drive.  A closed loop primary water-cooling system is also incorporated into the unit and includes a heat exchanger for connecting into a secondary cold water supply.  Also included in the supply is the Volkswagen diagnostic software. This communicates to a PC, and gives the user direct access to view the current parameters used by the engine control unit (ECU), such as ignition timing, injector opening times, and many more. In particular the injector opening times can be used to calculate an accurate fuel consumption figure for the engine. The ECU also records any engine faults and these are accessible by this software.  This CM11 is highly specialized and is unique from other lab based engines available with regard to operational capability

5th NEED: A heat transfer experiment apparatus that is able to be remotely operated through the internet.  The HT10XC is the only known unit currently available that has the capability of remote access operation either over an intranet or internet for distance learning.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/NOS National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, has a requirement for equipment to acoustically track tropical reef fishes.  NOS’s underwater hydroacoustic telemetry needs include the ability of the equipment to track large number of fishes with a wide range of sizes and habitat requirements.  NOS requires internal tags small enough (i.e., 20mm or less in length) to be implanted in fish down to 150mm (ca. tag size 30mm or less), yet powerful enough to be detected in a variety of habitats (coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves) which have variable range detection limitations.  The tags must be capable of “pinging” for at least 1 year and have sufficient power output to be detected at least 500m away from a receiver.  If loss of battery power occurs, the tags must have the capability to store the data for future down loading of the information.  NOS requires at least ¬¬125 coded tags and 25 continuous tags.  NOS also requires at least 40 submersible receivers that are durable, cost effective, capable of detecting several hundred tags coded simultaneously, and can be deployed for up to one year without battery change or loss of data.  The receivers must have a wide dynamic range permitting simultaneous detection of near and distant tags without gain adjustment.  The receivers must have time and position display and data logging capabilities.  The receivers must have the ability to rapidly download data to a laptop computer while in the field.  NOS also requires a manual tracking receiver that is durable, splash proof, and capable of also detecting coded tags of different frequencies simultaneously.  Specifically, NOS requires an omni-directional hydrophone with 5-meters of cable and a directional hydrophone with 10-meters of cable.  This requirement is not set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the applicable size standard is 750 employees.  Responses must be sent electronically in MS Word format to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov and in paper to Pauline Jaffe, Contract Specialist, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7604, SSMC4, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, no later than 11:00 am, local time, on August 18, 2005.  The applicable terms and conditions for the resulting purchase order are current through FAC 2005-03 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Interested contractors are hereby advised that contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Please register with CCR at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov.

How is the information currently maintained, is it de-centralized, stove pipe data maintained across ARC in different file formats and made available on specific requests? A3.

If these are to be re-engineered, is there a requirements specification document available for this purpose? A7.	There is not a separate document.  Please use the description provided. Q8.

<DESC>The combined synopsis/solicitation, RFQ001421, is hereby cancelled for technical reasons.  Any responses that were submitted to this combined synopsis/solicitation will not receive any further action or reply.  




This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations, (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The Request for Quote, (RFQ), number is RFQ E001421, and is being conducted as a 100% small business set aside. The North American Industrial Classification System Code is 334220; the size standard is 750 employees.  This RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis as a commercial item, fixed price contract under the procedures of FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This RFQ is for Brand Name or Equal in accordance with FAR 11.104.  Substitute brands may be provided if they perform the same function.  If quote is for an equal product, specifications of the items must be included in the quote.  Products equal to Brand Name must be accompanied with verifiable references.  A technical panel for acceptance prior to award will evaluate references.  Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI), has a requirement for a one time fixed price purchase of the following products:  (1) Motorola EX600XLS VHF Radio with Lithium Ion Battery (136-174MHz), Qty. 20; (2) Motorola VHF 9cm Stubby Antenna (155-174 MHz)(PMAD14013A), Qty. 20; (3) EX600XLS UHF Radio with Lithium Ion Battery (403-470 MHz), Qty. 20; (4) Universal Radio Pak (RLN4815), Qty. 20; (5) Lightweight Headset (NMN6246), Qty. 20; (6) EX600 Audio Adapter (PMLN4455), Qty. 30.  The justification for Brand Name or Equal is based on compatibility. The FBI legacy radio system is built strictly upon the Motorola platform.  Purchasing Motorola equipment is the only option because Motorola equipment complies with APCO P25 standards interfaces with the existing infrastructure, and provides the level of security necessary for the FBIs encrypted communications.  The radios must be compatible with existing equipment.  Delivery of items shall be within 30 days After Receipt of Order, (ARO).  Destination: FOB; FBI Engineering Research Facility, Quantico, VA 22135.  The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Governments rights under the Inspection Clause, nor does it limit the Governments rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of the contract.  In the event of a conflict the terms and conditions of the Governments contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of all items provided to the government by the Contractor.  FAR Clauses and Provisions applicable to this acquisition can be obtained from the website, http://www.acqent.gov.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.       What is the ceiling height for the rooms?  Max ceiling height would be fine. We just need to know if this is a two person or one person job and if we need a lift or just a simple 6ft ladder. 
 
        - No Lift required, these are standard 9 ft ceilings.  From previous installs I have seen, one person can put one in with a standard 6 ft ladder.
 
2.       Does the ceiling already have a ceiling plate from another projector?  Are the ceilings drop ceilings or a firm solid fixture to bolt the mounts onto?  Some drop ceilings will require another plate to bracket the mount onto. 
 
        - We have drop ceilings with poles mounted into the uni-strut above the ceiling.  The pieces I am asking for will screw on to the pole and connect with the projector. I currently have the top piece that screws on to the existing pole, the bottom piece is different for each projector. 
 
 
3.       The existing conduit:  What is the size (diameter) of the existing conduit?  The issue and concern is in order to extend an USB connection 30 feet, two 16' active USB cables will need to be connected in serial.  This may present a problem as the cable end of one is a little larger to amplify the USB signal.  This connection will require a minimum of 2" of free space within the existing conduit.  What about wireless USB mouse connection? 
 
    - The existing conduit is approximately 2 inches in diameter.  If it helps we currently have serial mouse cable run through the conduit.  Wireless will work only if it is IR versus RF.  The reason is that these rooms are close together and we don not want each room activating another.  
3. I assume that old cables and conduit for the mice are in place for all of the locations.  Is that correct? 

Yes they are in the existing conduit.


 4. Is  there a 120 volt power outlet available within a few feet of the location of these projectors 
in order to plug them in?  

Yes there is a standard wall plug at the PC where the mouse will plug in.

5. Is there a specific brand and model # that is the basis for the RFQ?  We want to ensure the proper suggestion of exact or better solutions.

The end user had based their purchase request on an NEC model VT 770, but a projector with equal or better capabilities would be acceptable.

6. Are there existing screens,  and if so what size ?

 Yes there are existing screens that are 65" x 65"

7. Have the existing Eiki LC-X990 projectors already been removed or is removal to be included in this contract?

No they have not been removed yet.  They are still being used and will be removed prior to installation of the new projectors.  No they are not part of this contract

8. What are the sources of info going to projectors ?

 Video, PC input 2 each, Sound

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The United States and Vietnam signed a bilateral aviation agreement in December 2003.  Taking advantage of the substantial amount of air traffic between the two countries, this five-year agreement will allow U.S. and Vietnamese airlines to provide direct flights between the two countries for the first time in almost 30 years.  This was one of the first significant steps taken since the bilateral trade agreement was signed in 2001, and it signaled the willingness of the United States and Vietnam to work together towards mutual commercial gains.  

A potential next step in enhancing this cooperation lies in the development of airports in Vietnam, including Chu Lai and Long Thanh.  The Chu Lai airport was originally constructed 40 years ago from a U.S. military airstrip.  Located 100 kilometers south of Ho Chi Minh City in the middle of Vietnam, it is part of the evolving Chu Lai opening economic zone (OEZ).  While commerce in this area is relatively scarce, plans are being made to enhance the region’s development in such areas as industry, tourism, and transportation.  The airport currently has only one runway, but renovations will soon provide two additional runways large enough to accommodate heavy planes.  Approved by the Vietnamese government as one of six international airports, Chu Lai has the potential to serve as an effective cargo and passenger hub for Vietnam.

The development of a new international airport in Long Thanh is another potential opportunity for furthering U.S. involvement in Vietnam’s aviation market.  The current airport servicing Ho Chi Minh City consists of two parallel runways and a single passenger terminal.  Located within city limits, the airport is constrained by nearby urban development and will be unable to undergo further expansion after the construction of an International Terminal.  In order to expand aviation capacity in the region, the Government of Vietnam is planning to build a new airport 30 kilometers east of Ho Chi Minh City, in Long Thanh.  This airport will enable the region to meet its projected air traffic demand and also provide a hub for regional, international, and passenger traffic, resulting in a substantial impact on the development in the region.

The Luang Prabang International Airport in Laos is experiencing similar growth challenges.  The entire town of Luang Prabang is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which limits the construction of new buildings and requires development to be consistent with the town's cultural environment.  Tourism has grown steadily in recent years and the current airport is increasingly less able to accommodate traffic.  There are some upgrades that can be made to improve capacity within the airport's current space.  However, given its UNESCO designation, the airport may have to relocate outside of the town if a larger expansion is required.  The Civil Aviation Department of Laos needs technical assistance to determine the investment requirements for the both the upgrading and relocation options.  


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.
