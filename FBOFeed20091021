<p>RECOVERY-PROJECT NUMBER ZHTV072837, Maintain Storm Water Runoff Pond<br />Drain and dredge Duck Pond then install three 8' wide concrete channels (one 310' draining in a straight run into a drainage inlet and two (95' and 210') for side drainage into the inlet) to drain to a proposed control inlet. The control inlet then drains through a new 12" drainage pipe to a new junction box which drains to the storm drainage under Pearson Rd. Backfill pond with 4,000 cubic yards of fresh fill to eliminate the Pond. This alleviates a significant annual maintenance problem of draining and cleaning out the Pond. Also, alleviates a biological hazard from water fowl.</p>

<DESC>WIND FOR SCHOOLS – NEW STATE PROGRAMS

Description:
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program (WHTP), through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), seeks organizations interested in expanding state-based activities in the Wind Powering America (WPA) Wind for Schools (WfS) project. The WPA program is expanding the WfS activity from the six existing states of Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota starting late in 2009 to three to six new states from its current six-state pilot phase. The WfS project helps address the wind industry’s need to develop a skilled workforce to support the expanded development and application of wind technologies.

Background: 
The WfS project long-term objective is to educate engineers in wind applications analysis and development through the development of Wind Applications Centers (WACs) located at colleges or universities in wind rich states. The second objective of the WfS program is to educate K-12 students in wind energy and engage rural communities in a discussion regarding applications and benefits of a robust wind future for America. This second objective is met by installing wind turbines at K-12 schools and assisting these schools in implementing wind-focused curricula through curricula development and outreach, school support, and teacher training workshops. By assisting in the implementation of the wind turbine projects, students at the WAC’s obtain a better understanding of wind technology development, thus helping to fulfill the first of these objectives. Through these activities, the WHTP is helping to address two of the major challenges for the wind industry identified in the DOE 20% Wind Energy by 2030 Report, the need for a qualified work force to support the deployment of wind systems and support in addressing public concerns of wind energy deployment.

Based on experience with the current group of six pilot state projects, it has been determined that it is important to engage both a university and an in-state person to interact with the variety of stakeholders that will become involved in a school wind project.  Through the WAC, engineering students learn about wind technologies and assist in the development of host school projects, gaining experience in wind applications engineering. The in-state person, the WfS facilitator, engages and coordinates the interactions among the host schools’ administrations, the schools’ science teachers, the associated communities, the university-based WAC leadership, the state energy office, and the corporate green sponsor. Over time it is expected that the WAC leadership would take over this vital role, becoming the main facilitator for WfS development within the state.

The WfS project currently provides support to the state facilitator, the WAC, and other support services with the state playing a large role in supplying or identifying funding to support the installation of wind turbines at K-12 host schools.

Project Plan:
The WPA program is expanding the WfS activity to three to six new states beginning in late 2009. 

Partners are expected to:
• Identify and provide support for the WAC at a state college or university, including the implementation of classes featuring wind energy with a focus towards the deployment of wind technologies
• Identify and support a state facilitator to work with the WAC, the K-12 host schools, and the host schools community on project implementation
• Perform or promote wind education and technical assistance to local communities
• Support the implementation of wind assessment / measurement systems to support resource assessments at schools. These systems are typically provided to the WAC and offer an educational opportunity for students at the university or associated community colleges
• Provide funding and other support for the installation of a WfS system at the WAC to facilitate training and educational opportunities for WAC students
• Support the implementation of the National Energy Education Development (NEED) Project or other teacher-training program(s) and equipment
• Report and share data on system performance

Expected NREL contribution will be up to approximately $60K/subcontract each year for up to 3 years.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for the pavement replacement for roads, parking lots, and storage areas in and around its desalting complex and office facilities, Yuma County, Yuma, Arizona.  This project will be partially or wholly funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  Please be advised that the Awardee will be subject to Section 1512(c) of ARRA, which requires that each contractor report on its ARRA funds under the awarded contract.  These reports will be made available to the public.
Project Description:  North Shore RV Park was a small recreation concession near Mecca, California, on the east shore of the Salton Sea.  It was operated by a succession of private lessees on lands leased from Reclamation since the 1960s.  At one time it included several dozen recreational camping spaces, a marina for sport fishing and boating, and other amenities.  As water based recreation use at the Salton Sea declined over the years, North Shore RV Park became increasingly less financially viable.
North Shore RV Park is located in the South West of Section 34, Township 7 South, Range 10 East, San Bernardino Meridian, California.
The existing facility and associated infrastructure has deteriorated to the point that it has become an attractive nuisance in addition to possible health and safety issues.  Although an effort has been made to limit access to the site, a number of the abandoned trailers have been subject to vandalism.
In order to reduce government liability and in order to reduce the attractive nuisance the vacated trailers and buildings present, Reclamation is requiring that the trailers including slabs, washroom/restroom building, power distribution boxes, trailer power pedestals, hose spigots and above ground irrigation lines, light poles, dying trees, rock and concrete landscaping, fencing and trash pickup.  Included is hazardous waste removal and disposal noted in the HAZMAT report.  The sewer line at each pad/building will have to be plugged.
Due to the presence of asbestos, it will be necessary for the demolition work to include any required lead paint and asbestos abatement and disposal in accordance with the requirements of local, state, and federal governing entities including the necessary inspections and notifications. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M.
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin December 28, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of June 28, 2010. Bid Bond, Payment and Performance Bonds are required.
The magnitude of this construction project is estimated to be between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The anticipated period of performance is 180 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.  
The acquisition was offered to and accepted by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the 8(a) Program and will be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) firms within Region IX.  Therefore, invitation for bids will be extended to firms eligible for program participation located within the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada.  There will be a formal public bid opening.  This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the method outlined in FAR Part 14 - Sealed Bidding.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price construction type.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available only through Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about November 05, 2009.  A site visit/pre-proposal conference will be held on or about November 16, 2009.  Bids will be due on or about December 05, 2009.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Ann Reifman, Ph.D., 3000 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington DC 20008, for professional services of a clinician with expertise in schizophrenia. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 622210 and the business size standard is $34.5 million.<br /><br />The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB) is part of the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, NIH. It is the principle research laboratory in the newly created (2003) Genes, Cognition, and Psychosis Program (GCAP) of the NIMH. CBDB is a multidisciplinary neuroscience laboratory in which basic and clinical scientists work side by side exploring neural mechanisms and models of mental and cognitive function and of neuropsychiatric illness. Experiments are performed at many levels of inquiry, from basic molecular biology of the gene to clinical examinations of patients. A major area of investigation of this laboratory is the genetic mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and its treatment.<br />
<p>The CBDB is seeking the services of a clinician with expertise in schizophrenia to be part of its large research project investigating schizophrenia and genetics. The contractor will conduct in depth interviews of patients with severe mental illness, siblings of these individuals and control subjects to determine accurate clinical diagnoses. Patient records will also be examined to further evaluate clinical diagnosis. The contractor will work to establish a clinical diagnostic procedure that better reflects research needs and increase the ability of subjects - many of whom are psychotic and paranoid - to answer difficult questions about their illness. The contractor will monitor research efforts in other institutions. The contractor is also responsible for determining whether an individual meets the CBDB's clinical diagnostic criteria in order to participate in the NIMH's study.</p>
<p>Starting in 1970 Dr. Reifman worked at the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia and later at the Neuropsychiatry branch, both of NIMH. Dr. Reifman had coordinated a Clinical Psychology Internship which focused on the treatment of people with severe mental illness.&nbsp;Dr. Reifman was voted by the mental health clinicians (including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers) in the Washington DC area to be one of a handful of top therapists for people with schizophrenia. Based on her previous experiences and involvement with the studies at NIMH, Dr. Reifman is considered highly qualified and best candidate for the requirement.</p>
<p>The period of performance is to be twelve (12) months from date of award. Place of performance is to be at the NIH main campus located in Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The type of this acquisition is a fee-for-service. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed above the said party may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 11:00 AM E.T., October 30, 2009 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov.

<p>The CBDB is seeking social work services to provide support to two ongoing projects at NIMH. These services include community outreach, candidate screening, and assisting the training of new CBDB social workers for both inpatient social work duties and recruitment. The two projects are: 1) a family based genetic study of schizophrenia. The genetic research goals have expanded and need the recruitment of man more subjects for four different studies; 2) an inpatient study involves taking patients with schizophrenia off their medications for extended periods. This requires intensive and sophisticated social work services. Considerable skill is required to coordinate the research participation for the SCID/DNA arm of the outpatient genetic study of the Genes, Cognition and Psychosis/ Clinical Brain Disorders Branch. The study requires specialized knowledge of the genetic study of schizophrenia, clinical skill to assess the appropriateness of a candidate and whether or not the candidate meets the competency requirements to give informed consent. Knowledge of and testing procedures and NIH policies governing research with human subjects is also imperative. The contractor to perform this requirement must also have therapeutic skills to build the necessary alliances with very impaired individuals to assure their voluntary participation and informed decisions. In completing the FIGs analysis of families, a great deal of diagnostic expertise is required.</p>
<p>Carol Rodeffer has been part of the original research team that launched the protocol 95-M-1050, the Genetic Study of Schizophrenia. Ms. Rodeffer has developed specialized knowledge and skills pertinent to this protocol and has served as an associate investigator on the study since 1998. Ms. Rodeffer has continued to work for the outpatient genetic study and has been the chief coordinator for the SCID/DNA arm of the study. She has recruited for the inpatient and outpatient programs and has screened for healthy volunteers for the Genetic study as well. Because of her long-standing and considerable knowledge of the illness of schizophrenia and her expertise in working with patients and their families, Ms. Rodeffer is considered uniquely qualified candidate and a sole source for this ongoing study. Changing research coordinator at this phase of the project will result in un-necessary delays in service and risk a less than satisfactory delivery of service by an unknown service provider. Hence it is determined that Ms. Rodeffer is the only source qualified to perform the required services.</p>
<p>The period of performance is to be twelve (12) months from date of award. Place of performance is to be at the NIH main campus located in Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The type of this acquisition is a fee-for-service. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed above the said party may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 11:00 AM E.T., October 30, 2009 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) Advanced Marine Center located in Washington, DC under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  This acquisition is for the procurement of Full Mission Bridge (FMB) I training device upgrades and an FMB II training device to be located at the Surface Warfare Officer’s School (SWOS) located in Newport, RI.  The Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE), inclusive of FMB I, FMB II, COVE I, COVE III, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) FMB, and all associated peripherals, utilize the current COVE baseline software suite.  The COVE baseline software suite includes the CSC proprietary Virtual Ship (VShip) 2000© Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software architecture plus all modifications, enhancements, components, sub-components, and databases purchased and developed by the Government.  Navy specific enhancements and scenarios within the COVE baseline software suite are non-severable from the CSC VShip 2000© proprietary software.  The training system hardware design is directly influenced by the COVE baseline software functionality.  As CSC retains the proprietary knowledge to VShip 2000©, no other potential competitor could satisfy the requirement to utilize the current COVE baseline software suite in its design.  The estimated budget for this requirement is $2,900,000 (exclusive of options), with a projected delivery date of 12 to 18 months.  Neither the budget nor schedule for this procurement allow for an alternative software solution, which would require a re-host of the entire COVE environment.  NAWC TSD intends to competitively issue a single award Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (IDV) type contract in Fiscal Year 2010, which will allow for competing software solutions.  This IDV will be advertised under a separate synopsis.

Responses to this synopsis must demonstrate the interested party’s ability to provide a solution that supports the current COVE baseline software suite in the absence of a non-exclusive, non-pass through teaming arrangement with CSC.  Information received from this synopsis will be used to establish the availability of competition and any potential socio-economic set-aside opportunities.  Therefore, responses shall include the interested party’s size status and all applicable socio-economic certifications.

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed to the point of contact in this posting.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future acquisition.

The primary location for these projects is in Guam.  Projects are anticipated to involve primarily new construction, and repair and alteration of the following types of structures: single or multi-story buildings, high bay structures, masonry, concrete steel, and pre-engineered structures; barracks and dormitory buildings, administrative facilities; educational facilities, libraries, medical facilities, dining facilities; industrial/warehouse facilities; waterfront facilities (piers and wharves); and aircraft facilities (including hangars and aprons), site utilities and infrastructure; ranges and operational/training facilities.  All work shall be performed in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local policy, guidance, regulations, and laws including, but not limited to the Unified Facilities Criteria and EM 385-1-1 Safety and Health Requirements Manual. 
This procurement is an IDIQ type contract where the work will be ordered via task orders on an as needed basis during the life of the contract.  Each task order will be a firm fixed price.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using negotiated rates and negotiating the effort required to perform the particular project.  The minimum order limit is $25,000 and maximum order limit is $5,000,000.  The estimated fee is $20,000,000 per period.  The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of initial contract with four (4) additional one-year option periods.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $100,000,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $25,000 for the base period only.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A-E performance under the contract.  Proposals will be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  
Evaluation and selection will be based on the most qualified firm upon evaluation of the selection criteria stated herein.  The A-E must demonstrate their qualifications and its key consultants' qualifications with respect to the published selection criteria for all services.  The following selection evaluation criteria 1 through 7, in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms:
(1) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for construction management services of new infrastructure, and alteration, renovation and repair type projects.  Firm's demonstrated recent experience with regard to construction management services of base facilities similar in size, complexity, and dollar value.  Base facilities include, but are not limited to, barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and fire/police stations. Individual features (barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and fire/police stations) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features will be evaluated more favorably than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, and seismic zone) will be considered more favorably.  Describe a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in construction management services of the projects discussed above.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order, or an accumulation of related task orders under the same IDIQ contract having the features described above.   
(2) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for construction management services of new infrastructure, and alteration, renovation and repair of existing infrastructure type projects.  Key personnel are identified as the Program Manager and Project Managers in the following disciplines: Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Geotechnical. Limit submission to not more than ten (10) key personnel including the Program Manager and the Project Managers for each of the six major disciplines described above, and three other key personnel deemed by the firm to be most important to the success of the team. 
(3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, cost control, and cooperation and responsiveness.  Firms will be evaluated on past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in selection criterion (1)), and cooperation and responsiveness.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards. Firms will also be evaluated on performance evaluations obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS). 
(4) Capacity to perform the potential quantity and variety of work that may be ordered under this contract.  Firms will be evaluated on their capacity to accomplish the work.  For all 10 key personnel identified in selection criterion (2), explain the scope of responsibilities in the proposed organization and the effectiveness of the firm's organizational structure for the contract.
(5) A-E's quality and cost control program experience.  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality and cost control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of construction management services. List responsible key personnel identified in selection criterion (2). 
(6) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  Identify each subcontractor by name, discipline, size status, dollar values, and percentage of subcontracting and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY10 subcontracting targets in terms of percentages of total subcontract effort are: 65.65% to SB, 16.27% to SDB, 14.68% to WOSB, 1.37% to HUBZoneSB and 3.0% to SDVOSB.   Firms not intending to subcontract and/or not meeting the respective SB goals should provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  In order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as HUBZoneSB either as prime or subcontractor, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subcontractor is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. 
(7) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had prior Department of Defense contracts. 
Include the following items in Section H, Block 30 of the Standard Form (SF) 330: (1) a summary of qualifications in narrative form addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria; (2) an organizational chart of the proposed team showing the names and roles of all key personnel listed in Section E with the associated firm as listed in Section C; (3) your DUNS, CAGE, and TIN numbers; and (4) evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering, i.e., State Registration number.  For selection criteria (3) the Government will also evaluate each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) from ACASS during the evaluation process.

All contractors are advised that registration in the CCR is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the CCR database may render your firm ineligible for award.  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD 1391), facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.

Procurements under this class synopsis will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W91278-09-D-0105.<br><br>RECOVERY  PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  <BR>Using Recovery  Act Funding,  the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a  task order to contract W91278-09-D-0105, an 8(a) sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for  general technical services related to planning and operations for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District.   This task order will require the contractor to develop strategies and documentation toward the development and inclusion in a draft Dredge Materials Management Plan for Mobile Harbor.  The contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, necessary to prepare draft guidelines for sustainable dredging and long-term dredged material management of the Federal Navigation project of the Mobile River and recently constructed turning basin for a period of at least 30 years.  <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1)  The work to be performed is within the scope of the original contracts' technical provisions.  2)  The incumbent contractor has  the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively  accomplish this work at reasonable cost.  3) This contract enables the work to begin immediately. <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.   The Mobile District intends to use the current IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) contract to meet its requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded as an 8(a) sole source contract.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for effective and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.   Furthermore, the existing IDIQ contractor has experienced personnel.   Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing IDIQ contract to accomplish the requirements listed above.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE:

THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL !

This notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirement stated below. This is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a solicitation. The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice. 

THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL !

Project Name:  
Central NM Landscape Restoration Project 

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Southwestern Region (AZ and NM) of the USDA Forest Service is in the beginning stage of planning a comprehensive, multi-year forest restoration project across central New Mexico, merging with ongoing restoration across Arizona. This request for information is the initial phase used to gather information and explore contract options.  The project objective is to restore ponderosa pine and pinon/juniper forest types by thinning and harvesting mainly small diameter trees in excess of ecological requirements.  Restoration would occur initially in the Grants, NM (Zuni Mountains) to the Reserve, NM area. The area will be further defined during the collaborative planning process. Ultimately, over the next planning phases, restoration would occur across at least three New Mexico national forests and one Arizona forest of mostly ponderosa pine, pinon/juniper woodlands and dry mixed conifer forests.  Present forest forecast has indicated priority restoration work being planned on the Reserve and Quemado Ranger Districts of the Gila NF, Mt. Taylor and Magdalena Ranger Districts of the Cibola, and the Coyote, Cuba and Jemez Ranger Districts in the Jemez Mountains of the Santa Fe National Forest.  The Alpine Ranger District on the Apache-Sitgreaves NF also has restoration work being planned producing forest products which could merge into a central New Mexico working circle.

The rate of treatment is anticipated to be a minimum of 5,000 acres per year over a ten-year contract period.  It is expected that most treatment areas would accommodate ground-based harvest systems with some temporary road construction requirements but little to no new, specified road construction needs.  Forest products include small diameter ponderosa pine, and varying amounts of pinon, juniper, and other softwoods.  Typical yields would range between 600-800 cubic feet per acre in pine and 3-5 cords per acre in pinion/juniper.

The purpose of this request is to identify companies and industries that might be interested in learning more, potentially being a partner or proponent, and participating in the early phases of the planning process.  There is no formal contract at present, the exact acres to be treated have not been identified, and the exact amount of wood to be removed has not been determined.  However, a crude supply estimate has determined that there is a large sustainable supply for up to 10 years projected, and the Forest Service is confident that the volumes will be substantial and firm.  From this information it is projected that there will be more contracts of comparable size in the future. 

TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOITATION:
Industry is encouraged to explore new technology in response to the projected abundant secure supply being offered. Once a contract is developed and awarded, the selected firm(s) may utilize harvested material through the existing forest product infrastructure or a mixture of new technology and existing infrastructure.  Economic growth in the area is anticipated.  

FOREST SERVICE OBJECTIVE:
Invite an open dialogue with industry to better understand the needs and desires of industry to build new woody biomass utilization businesses in this area.  The Forest Service has many questions on how to enter into a relationship with industry in this area and for this size endeavor.  Some of our initial questions are the start up options that industry partners may desire; what contract type and options would work best; how should the contract be structured to meet industry needs, etc.  

The open dialogue will also allow the Forest Service to share expectations, current requirements, limitations, flexibilities, potential opportunities, and learn more industry needs.  This information gathering is anticipated to be iterative in nature and may include solicitations of interest, face to face meetings, open public meetings, as well as by phone and/or video conferences. 

A very important additional objective is to encourage industry engagement in the collaborative planning process from the beginning. This collaborative process will involve a wide variety of stakeholders ranging from other industry representatives, environmental non-governmental organizations, community representatives, other State, Federal and local agencies and individuals.  Interests have been expressed on “how” products will be removed, what types of industry will be developed and how will new industry interact with existing, local industry. This process has been going on locally for several months.  The Forest Service desires to expand the industry participation at these meetings.  The process has been very productive to date and there is broad-based support.  The process has been very positive and it appears now is the time to take the next large steps and solicit interest from a number of potential industry partners to produce a forest restoration and utilization project that the State of Arizona, the Forest Service, the local communities, industry, and the other key stakeholders can be proud of.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is: 115310, “Support Activities for Forestry”.   
Submission Requirements:  
So that we may better determine capabilities for this prospective procurement, we request that you consider the questions we provided on the attached document and submit a copy of your company’s capability statement (no more than 5 pages) along with any questions and/or comments to the following email points of contact by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on Friday, December 4, 2009, with the title of the project (Central New Mexico Landscape Restoration Project) in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. Due to lack of time and resources the preferred method of communication is by email.  Phone calls will not be returned.

<DESC>Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) Ship Support Unit (SSU) Guam anticipates entering into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with several rental car companies to supply rental car services to MSFSC assets on the island of Guam.  This requirement is a Small Business Set Aside.

This acquisition will follow Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

Due to the anticipated dollar thresholds involved, per FAR 13.003(b)(1), this acquisition will be reserved exclusively for small business concerns, as defined in FAR Part 19.

The government intends to award multiple BPAs to maximize competition for each order.  BPAs may be established with large and small business concerns.  The BPAs shall remain in effect up to five (5) years.  The government reserves the right to terminate any or all BPA agreement by giving vendors thirty (30) days notice.  The government has identified the following as the minimum needs for this requirement:

Currently MSFSC SSU Guam receives ten (10) to twelve (12) rental car requests per month, with five (5) to eight (8) vehicles per request.  Typical rental periods average five (5) to seven (7) days.  However, some rental requests can be for as long as thirty (30) days.  

The attached Statement of Work (SOW) contains the service/performance requirements of the BPA.

Vendors interested in entering into a BPA with the Government should review the attached SOW, and submit pricing (daily, weekly, and monthly rates) for the classes of vehicles identified on the Commercial Vehicle Rental Price List (first page of the SOW).

Pricing should be submitted for as many of the vehicle classes as the vendors inventory allows.

Only vendors that are able to satisfy the above criteria specified should express an interest to the government at this time.  This minimum requirements are not subject to change.  Vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA).

NAICS code 532111 applies. 

Price lists from interested vendors should be received as an e-mail attachment no later than 10 November 2009.  Price lists should be submitted via e-mail to Mr. Ted Williams @ Theodore.R.Williams@fe.navy.mil or Mr. Larry Baron @ Lawrence.Baron@fe.navy.mil.  

Late submissions will not be considered.

Price lists submitted should be certified (via vendor signature) as valid for a period of no more than five (5) years from the date of submission.  Price lists will be counter-signed by the contracting officer upon establishment of the BPA.

MSFSC anticipates entering into BPAs with a many as three (3) lowest-priced, technically acceptable vendors.

Low price will be determined by conducting a line for line comparison of submitted prices per vehicle class, specifically the daily rates for Items 0001, 0002, 0007A, 0007B, and 0008 (see Commercial Vehicle Rental Price List of the attached SOW) – as these vehicle classes and rates represent the majority of rental requests.  The low price vendor(s) will be determined by the lowest daily rates on the majority of the following vehicle classes:  Items 0001, 0002, 0007A, 0007B, and 0008.

Technical acceptability will be established by receipt of a complete and comprehensive price list.  Failure to provide price quotes on each of the ten (10) classes of vehicles will render the offer technically unacceptable.  

After the BPAs are established, rental vehicle requests will be competed to the eligible vendors as they are received.  It is recognized that a vendor may not be able to supply every vehicle on each request every time.  However, rental requests will not be split.  If a vendor is not able to supply a request in its entirety, then the request will be awarded to the eligible vendor as applicable.  

Questions regarding performance specifications or requirements of the attached SOW should be directed via e-mail to Mr. Ted Williams @ Theodore.R.Williams@fe.navy.mil or Mr. Larry Baron @ Lawrence.Baron@fe.navy.mil.  Questions will be entertained through the close of business, local Guam time, 15 November 2009.

NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 334112; PSC code is 5835.  The Navy reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon response hereto for any subsequent acquisition.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.

Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  The Navy does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Navy for any purpose.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Bliss, Texas intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to the Fort Bliss Lodging Fund, Dickman Road, Bldg 5016, Fort Bliss Texas.  The award will be made for the lease of up to 4650 rooms per month for the period of 1 October 2009   8 January 2010.  Requirement is for an estimated monthly lease of 4650  non-casino hotel rooms for the 5th AR, Division lodging of soldiers in support of the training mission.

The personnel must have immediate access to the training facilities located on Fort Bliss Installation, McGregor Range and Dona Ana Range to ensure no disruption or suspension in pre-deployment training and mobilization schedule which would create unacceptable delays in meeting the mission.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses should be emailed to Jay Kennedy at lurch.kennedy@conus.army.mil

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
Bull Trout Consultations
Vendor:
Theresa DoumittPO BOX 44Ririe, ID 83443
The Salmon-Challis National Forest (SCNF) is re-initiating consultation with the Eastern Idaho Fish and Wildlife Office (FWS) for Upper Columbia River bull trout on approximately 41 livestock grazing allotments.  There is a projected completion date of July, 2010.  This ambitious schedule will create a large workload for the FWS to review Biological Assessments (BAs) submitted by the SCNF, and then complete Biological Opinions.  In order to meet the workload, FWS will need to hire a contractor to assist with specific deliverables.  As BAs are submitted by the SCNF, formal consultation begins and FWS will begin writing the BOs. Draft BOs will be provided to the SCNF for comment, then after the comments are received the final BOs will be written and provided to SCNF.  This process should begin early fall 2009 and continue through spring of 2010.  Timeframes and work effort for each BA and BO will vary due to differences in complexity of grazing and effects on each allotment.  
Our office has an urgent need for expert help to review these Biological Assessments (BA's) and write Biological Opinions (BO's).  This is an extremely important project for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with an urgent deadline of July 2010.  We chose Theresa Doumitt (P.O. Box 44, Ririe, ID  83443, 731-234-4229), for this contract job.  
The technical aspect of this project requires specific, scientific knowledge combined with excellent interpersonal skills, broad knowledge of state and federal agency protocols, and exceptional reading comprehension and technical writing skills that very few people posses.  Theresa Doumitt is uniquely qualified to complete this work.  She holds a Master's Degree in Wildlife Science with a minor in Experimental Statistics and has published 4 professional wildlife articles.  Theresa has many years of experience working for a variety of State and Federal Agencies and Universities including the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, Universities of New Mexico, Utah, Tennessee, and Idaho; all work that included working with biological data, reviewing information, analyzing data, and producing written reports.  Because of her extensive experience writing and reviewing documents and technical publications, exceptional interpersonal and partnership development skills and experience, and exceptional writing skills, she is uniquely qualified for this contract.  Because of the urgency and uniqueness of this assignment, Theresa is the only choice because her experience qualifies her to complete this important assignment and she requires no training or other start-up time and is ready to engage in assisting the FWS with meeting our urgent deadlines for these BO's. This project needs to be completed by July 2010 because of the Salmon Challis National Forests requirement to have Bull Trout consultations complete prior to turning cattle out on the National Forest where Bull Trout occur.  A delay in award of the contract would result in the Fish and Wildlife Service not meeting its legal timeline requirements and/or cause the Forest Service to delay cattle turn out by their Permittees.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/ Soliciation<br />Ref# 2010-77455
<p><br />The Coordinating Office of Global Health (COGH), Division of Global Public Health Capacity Development (DGPHCD) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently seeking sources to provide assistance as a Program Advisor in Iraq. This award will be in accordance with FAR 13 using simplified acquisition procedures. The contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor's Registration in order to do business with the government. To function effectively in this position, candidates must posses a high level of technical skills in epidemiology and public health, must be fluent in boty Arabic and English, must have teaching skills, must be trusted at high levels within the Iraq Ministries of Health of Higher Education and must be able to move freely outside the International Green Zone. An Iraqi Citizen is highly preferable for this position.</p>
<p>Any organization or individual doing buisness with the government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Follow link below&nbsp;for registration details.<br /><br />&nbsp;https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.<br /><br />Background</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iraq is a country with and estimated 2007 population of 27,499,638, with Baghdad, its larges city reporting 5,772,000 residents. The people of Iraq face a mixture of health hazards associated with poverty. Children, adolescents, women, the elderly, disabled people and those who are chronically ill are at particular risk. Child malnutrition rates are reportedly high. Communicable diseases are a major cause of illness and death. Non-communicable illnesses due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes, constitute a rising health burden.</p>
<p>Continued conflict in Iraq will present a continual disruption of surveillance for monitoring disease in the general population, a breakdown of public health infrastructure, damage to health facilities, and malfunction of water and sanitation systems that will lead to increased levels of illness, further suffering, and higher death rates. The dangers of pregnancy and childbirth will also be amplified. Common, preventable diseases such as diarrhea will continue to threaten life. There will be outbreaks of communicable diseases- including measles, meningococcal meningitis, pertussis and cholera. New disease patterns- including conditions that have previously been controlled- may be observed. Source: WHO Communicable Disease Profile for Iraq, March 2003.</p>
<p>As part of the reconstruction effort, the U.S. government is working with the Iraqi government to build health systems and strengthen health infrastructure. Building public health capacity is of major importance in this effort and this the U.S. CDC, Coordination Office of Global Health (COGH), Division of Global Public Health Capacity Development (DGPHCD), is directly funding the development of a Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP ) for Iraq, know as the I-FETP.</p>
<p>FETPs currently operate in over 30 countries around the world and the CDC's DGPHCD actively supports over 15 of them by providing funding, technical assistance and/or leadership. Theses programs are modeled after the U.S. CDC's own program, known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), which has served as the major outbreak investigation arm of the CDC and has produced over 3000 graduates since its inception in 1951. FETPs are characterized by three features; they offer training in the context of providing valuable service to the Ministry of Health (learning by doing), they are mentored, and they are competency-based in that graduates gain skills and experience rather than merely diplomas. By working with the Iraq Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), WHO-Iraq, U.S. Department of State, and other partners to start a sustainable I-FETP, CDC intends to help Iraq strengthen its capacity to respond to outbreaks, conduct surveillance for priority diseases, and use epidemiologic evidence for wise public health decision making.</p>

<p>Please read the following travel warning from the U.S. Department of State. Because of the travel warning an Iraqi citizen is preferable. U.S. Consulting companies are welcomed to apply for this contract, assuming the ability to place a candidate with the mobility to travel freely throughout Iraq and meet the qualifications of this advertisement</p>
<p>Travel Warning<br />United States Department of State<br />Bureau of Consular Affairs<br />Washington, DC 20520<br />________________________________________<br />This information is current as of today, Wed Oct 14 10:19:49 2009.<br />IRAQ <br />June 15, 2009<br />The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens of the dangers inherent in travel to Iraq and recommends against all but essential travel in country given the fluid security situation. Numerous insurgent groups remain active throughout Iraq. Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)-led military operations continue, and attacks persist against the ISF and U.S. forces in many areas of the country. Turkish government forces have carried out operations against elements of the Kongra-Gel terrorist group (KGK, formerly Kurdistan Worker's Party or PKK) located along Iraq's northern border. This Travel Warning warns U.S. citizens of the current security situation and reiterates the dangers of the use of civilian aircraft and of road travel within Iraq. This replaces the Travel Warning of June 13, 2008, to provide an update on security incidents and additional concerns about travel within Iraq. <br />Iraq Remains Dangerous and Unpredictable<br />While the security environment has shown significant improvement over the past year, Iraq remains dangerous and unpredictable. Attacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue, including in the International (or "Green") Zone. Methods of attack have included roadside improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortars and rockets, and human- and vehicle-borne IEDs. Kidnappings still occur; the most recent confirmed kidnapping of an American citizen reported to the U.S. Embassy occurred during July 2008 in Nassariya. In addition to terrorist and criminal attacks, sectarian violence occurs often. U.S. Government personnel require special permission and a security detail at all times when traveling outside of secure facilities and are prohibited from traveling to certain areas of Iraq depending on prevailing security conditions. Detailed security information is available on the Embassy's web site at hand at http://www.centcom.mil. <br />Transportation to/from and within Iraq<br />Travelers choosing to utilize commercial carriers to enter or depart Iraq should be aware that, although there have been no recent attacks on civilian aircraft, the potential threat still exists, as does the high risk to road transportation as described above. U.S. Government personnel, with limited exceptions, are generally required to use U.S. military or other official aircraft when entering or departing Iraq. There have been no recent security-related incidents associated with civilian airport operations. Embassy employees, including those resident in northern Iraq, may seek authorization, and under special limited circumstances, have obtained permission to use commercial airlines and civilian airports when entering or departing Iraq. Civilians, including tourists, business people, and temporary residents should recognize the risks associated with air travel to Iraq and must be guided by the security policies of their agencies, companies and sponsors. <br />Northern Iraq<br />The security situation in Sulymaniya, Erbil, and Dohuk Governorates in northern Iraq has been relatively more stable than the rest of Iraq in recent years, but violence persists and conditions could deteriorate quickly. Even though there have been fewer terrorist attacks and lower levels of insurgent violence in Sulymaniya, Erbil, and Dohuk than in other parts of Iraq, the security situation throughout the country remains fluid. Violence associated with the status of Kirkuk is likely to continue, at least within Kirkuk. Insurgent groups continue to operate across the north. In 2008, multiple incidents occurred in Sulymaniya, Erbil, and Dohuk involving IEDs, rocket and mortar fire, vehicle bombs, and shootings, though none resulted in U.S. casualties. While many parts of northern Iraq have become more stable, Mosul continues to experience intense violence and instability. <br />International Zone Restrictions<br />The U.S. Embassy is located in the International Zone (IZ) in Baghdad. The IZ is a restricted access area. The U.S. Government considers the potential threat to U.S. Government personnel assigned to Iraq to be sufficiently serious so as to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. <br />Limited Emergency Support to American Citizens<br />The U.S. Embassy provides limited visa services to the general public and provides restricted emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq, particularly those located outside of Baghdad. American citizens who choose to visit or reside in Iraq despite this Travel Warning are urged to take responsibility for their own personal security and belongings (including their U.S. passports), avoid crowds, especially rallies or demonstrations, and to inform the U.S. Embassy of their presence in Iraq. All Americans in Iraq are asked to register with the Embassy at the following website: https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. <br />Contact Information<br />American citizens may obtain the latest security information or other information about Iraq by contacting the U.S. Embassy, located in the International Zone, via landline at 1-240-553-0581, via e-mail to baghdadacs@state.gov, or by accessing the U.S. Embassy's website at http://iraq.usembassy.gov. The after-hours numbers in cases of extreme emergency are 011-964-770-443-2594 (from the US) or 964 0770-443-2594(within Iraq).<br />Updated information on travel and security in Iraq may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. For further information, please consult the Country Specific Information for Iraq, as well as the Worldwide Caution, both of which are available on the Bureau of Consular Affairs Internet website at http://travel.state.gov/.</p>

<DESC>Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation W912JC-10-R-5700 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) Total Small Business Set Aside. The NAICS is 81198 (set aside standard under $7.0 million). This is a onetime procurement that will be awarded to Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offeror.  An offer submitted that is below the government estimate by more than 25% may be dismissed without discussion by the contract officer under the assumption the offeror does not fully understand the requirement.

First Article:
A First Article will be required from a vendor tentatively selected prior to contract award in order to determine technical acceptability.  Should a company have previously performed this work satisfactorily for the RSMS or maintained a contract for this service in good standing with the RSMS a first article will not be required.  

Description of Services: 
M939 Series 5-Ton radiators will be delivered to the successful awarded offeror to be cleaned thoroughly, flushed and repaired with hoses and gaskets replaced.  All units overhauled will not have any leaks at the completion of testing.  

Clarification of Standards: This procedure has been designated as an overhaul; however items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation.  The overhaul is an imprecise term which means that enough work is done on the radiator unit to make it fully operational again and typically no root cause analysis is performed for these types of repairs.  New parts may be used as needed to complete these repairs.

This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement. 

Shipping and Delivery Schedule:
These radiators will be delivered to and also picked up from the awarded contractor in increments between 10-20 units at a time over the next ten months from the award date for an estimated total of 148 units.  This below delivery schedule is an estimate only and may vary.  Prices quotes for the services required may be itemized however one price per unit overhaul shall be submitted.  The price shall be the same for each unit based on the estimated quantities shown below.  Any unserviceable core shall be set aside for return to the RSMS.

<DESC><p>SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>ARTICLE C.1. BOA STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>A. Background</p>
<p>A goal of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to facilitate the development of promising imaging agents, so they can be safely and effectively used in clinical trials to provide unique diagnostic, staging, therapy selection, and monitoring information. These efforts are broad in scope and include pre-clinical development, creation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Chemistry Manufacturing &amp; Control (CMC) and quality control (QC)/quality assurance (QA), Investigational New Drug (IND) preparation and submission (including exploratory IND), supporting and conducting imaging clinical trials, and incorporating imaging into therapeutic trials. In addition to developing agents for use in NCI sponsored clinical trials, it is hoped that such development will progress to provision of a useful agent for other investigational trials including commercial therapeutic drug development and eventually to a commercial imaging agent product.</p>
<p>B. Purposes and Objective of Procurement</p>
<p>As a means to provide selected PET and SPECT radiopharmaceuticals to support non-clinical studies and both small early phase trials and larger trials, SAIC-F would like to engage subcontractors that are able to produce and distribute them on a unit dose basis to sites of special interest to SAIC-Frederick. A key requirement is the ability to produce doses to support preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted under authority of an IND or Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC). The products may be produced employing the subcontractor's established procedure, a published procedure, the procedure submitted in an NCI IND, or by a subcontractor-developed procedure that synthesizes the desired product (see Attachment I for examples). The procedure must be provided for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and accepted by the FDA if necessary. If distribution to additional sites is required, delivery will be handled by a separate subcontractor who can meet the unique requirements for shipping radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Cost proposals for each Task Order shall be broken into five (5) separate budget lines:</p>
<p>1. Cost of development and implementation of synthesis if required; <br />2. Cost of needed animal studies if required;<br />3. Cost of required documentation and filing if required; <br />4. Ongoing administrative cost to maintain capability in an active status; <br />5. Unit dose cost (adjusted for volume)</p>
<p>Some of the radiopharmaceuticals requested may already be routinely synthesized by the subcontractor, so portions of the budget lines listed here may not be necessary for a specific Task Order.</p>
<p>SAIC-Frederick reserves the right to make site visits to subcontractor prior to the awarding of a basic ordering agreement and also reserves the right to inspect any sites and records as required.</p>
<p>D. Subcontractor Requirements</p>
<p>1. Experience in the production of radiopharmaceuticals including alpha emitting, PET, and SPECT isotopes.<br />2. Ability to meet the requirements of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) &lt;823&gt;, and of the FDA for IND filing.<br />3. Ability to prepare and package for delivery unit doses of labeled compounds suitable for preclinical or clinical trial use.<br />4. A geographic location to allow delivery of short-lived radiopharmaceutical agents to Bethesda and Frederick, MD. <br />5. A positive ion cyclotron and experience in production of gas and liquid 18F, SPECT and alpha emitting nuclides.<br />6. A Small Animal Imaging capacity with high resolution PET, SPECT and CT scanners capable of auto-radiography, dosimetry, and surgery.<br />7. Adherence to and fulfillment of requirements of 1) The NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide), 2) the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 3) the Animal Welfare Act and 4) all applicable USDA laws and regulations for work conducted on animals.<br />8. Subcontractor must provide an NIH OLAW assurance number.<br />9. It is recommended that subcontractor adhere to the standards of and have accreditation to the Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AALAC, Int.).</p>
<p><br />E. Anticipated Task Order Deliverables</p>
<p>Although not required by this BOA, it is anticipated that the following types of deliverables will be required by any subsequent task orders.</p>
<p>The subcontractor will work closely with DCTD and the SAIC-Frederick subcontract support personnel to complete the development work on the synthesis methods and quality control assays necessary to write and compile the manufacturing production records, standard operating procedures, and other information required for producing multi-dose radiopharmaceuticals. Specifically, this work will be done on a Task Order basis for a specific radiopharmaceutical, and will include the following:</p>
<p>1. Develop the synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical if necessary.</p>
<p>2. Provide a Small Animal Imaging capacity with high resolution PET, SPECT and CT scanners capable of auto-radiography, dosimetry, and surgery and perform preclinical studies as requested.</p>
<p>3. Once the methodology has been scaled up and optimized, the contractor will write appropriate documentation for producing the radiopharmaceutical at their facility in sufficient detail for IND with the FDA or to assure an RDRC that the quality is appropriate for administration to human subjects. This documentation will include the necessary background development information, the complete written compilation of chemistry and synthesis methods, and detailed QC/QA procedures and any required qualification data to assure that the synthesized compound is pure and acceptable for injection in human subjects.</p>
<p>4. Prepare the radiopharmaceutical on a unit dose basis for preclinical studies and clinical trials at the institution or to sites of special interest to SAIC-Frederick to support the program goals. If distribution to a separate site is necessary, it is anticipated that a separate vendor will be requested to ensure that distribution is being conducted as local, state, and federal laws mandate.</p>
<p>5. Provide a written plan for auditing and allowing outside auditors to visit the facility as appropriate.</p>
<p>F. Meetings</p>
<p>It is anticipated that meetings with the subcontractor shall occur as needed to keep the SAIC-F COTR and NCI Project Officer informed regarding the progress of the project. In the absence of formal meetings, contact with the subcontractor shall occur via phone, fax, or electronic mail.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers (in descending order of importance): (1) Mat Capabilities and Physical Characteristics, (2) Technical Capability and Quality Assurance, (3) Warranty Terms and Warranty Process, (4) Relevant Past Performance, and (5) Price.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quotes against the following five factors:</p>
<p>(1) MAT CAPABILITIES AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors quotes must demonstrate, in clear detail, its capabilities and equipment intended to meet or exceed all specification requirements or it will not be considered. Evaluations will be based on the degree to which the offers exceed minimum requirements and attain offerings of added value if any. <br />&bull; The Offerors knowledge and experience in designing, manufacturing and delivering Active Carbon Mats.</p>
<p>(2) TECHNCIAL CAPABILITY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE:<br /><br />Offerors quote must demonstrate its ability to:</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacture and test the Active Core Mat; <br />&bull; Provide the technical expertise with qualified/certified employees; <br />&bull; Prevent discrepancies; <br />&bull; Responsively correct deficiencies if they are identified; <br />&bull; Inspect/certify assurance the product conforms to the specification requirements; and <br />&bull; Produce and deliver the mat by the required delivery date.</p>
<p>(3) WARRANTY TERMS AND WARRANTY PROCESS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each Offerors warranty plan. The warranty plan shall include responses to the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors plan for travel to Government unit locations with the proper tools and equipment to perform warranty repair work on the mat when it is determined that the repair work is covered under the warranty. <br />&bull; Warranty coverage of all parts, labor, and travel expenses in association with warranty repair work for the mat if the repair is covered under the warranty. <br />&bull; Means and method for handling disputed warranty claims.</p>
<p>(4) RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>&bull; The Government's intent is to evaluate each offerors past performance quality, including quality of product; price control; timeliness of performance; business relationships; and customer satisfaction, to determine whether the offerors consistently delivered quality products in a timely manner in the past. This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance for the offerors during the last three (3) years, including performance on contracts of similar scope. The information presented in the offerors' quotes, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (e.g., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases and references including contractual, technical, and end-user representatives) may provide input for the evaluation of this factor. <br />&bull; A lack of any relevant past performance information will be treated by the Government as a "Neutral" under this factor.</p>
<p>(5) PRICE:</p>
<p>&bull; The total overall evaluated price will determine price completeness, accuracy, and price reasonableness. An evaluation of the Offerors' price quotes will be made to determine if they are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical quote. Price reasonableness will be evaluated based on the receipt of competitive offers and comparisons to published commercial pricing of Offerors' and others' products and to the independent government estimate.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:</p>
<p>The basis for award will be best value, which will be based on consideration of the following factors (in descending order of importance): (1) Mat Capabilities and Physical Characteristics, (2) Technical Capability and Quality Assurance, (3) Warranty Terms and Warranty Process, (4) Relevant Past Performance, and (5) Price. All non-price factors when combined are more important than Price.</p>
<p>&bull; As the technical quotes become closer in quality, price increases in relative importance.</p>
<p>The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror that offers a mat providing greater advantages in the non-price evaluation criteria and/or is technically superior to the mats of lower priced offers.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION:</p>
<p>The technical evaluation will be attained through a determination and analysis of strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies. Technical risk will be included in the final evaluation of each factor and will not be evaluated as a separate factor. Technical risk is an overall assessment derived from the technical evaluation and is inclusive of each evaluation factor. In the assessment of technical risk, Government evaluators will consider all available information submitted in the quote.</p>
<p>52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERICAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) Alternate I (APR 2000) and Alternate II (OCT 2000)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-P-P45410 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year <br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan <br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:<br />A) Background</p>
<p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assists Central Asia's five nations to pursue a stable economy and democracy. USAID works across the Central Asian Republics (CAR) to develop and improve health, education, job creation, energy, water supply and relations between people and government. USAID supports opportunities for citizens of these countries to fully participate in improving their governance, livelihoods and quality of life.</p>
<p>USAID's Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and management of USAID assistance programs in five republics. The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Astana, Kazakhstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $80 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $300 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and conflict mitigation, and health and education. The Mission works in partnership with over 120 grantee and contractor teams.</p>
<p>In November 2005, Kyrgyzstan was selected to receive assistance from the Millennium Challenge Account Threshold Program. In May 2006, the Government of Kyrgyzstan (GoK) submitted a Threshold Program that focused on addressing governance shortcomings. The activities under the Program were expected to improve scores for MCC's indicators for Rule of Law and Control of Corruption, which were below thresholds required to become eligible for large-scale Compact assistance with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. A Threshold Program Assistance Agreement was signed in March 2008 to provide $16 million of support for the GoK's Threshold Program until June 2010. The Program focuses on three substantive areas: 1) judicial reform; 2) combating corruption in law enforcement; and 3) increasing the effectiveness of criminal prosecution. The implementing partners for these components are respectively DPK Consulting, the U.S. Department of Justice's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (DOJ/ICITAP), Criminal Division, and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (DOJ/OPDAT). There is a fourth separate component on monitoring and evaluation which is implemented by ARD, inc.</p>

<DESC>The Purpose of this amendment is to answer questions submitted 10/16/2009 and 10/19/2009 and to correct statement "Drawings are located at ftp://ftp.usace.army.mil/pub/lrb/Tug%20Cheraw%20Drawings/," at the end of the solicitation to add Safety Specifications. <br /><br />Part I. Questions 10/16/2009 <br /><br />1. ABS Survey - Work Item 2: Is the fee for this survey to be covered by your agency or Contractor? Is this vessel ABS-classed? Or do you just want a "Statement of Fact" survey? What all shall their survey cover? <br /><br />-Answer "The fee for the ABS survey is not to be included in the dry-dock contract." <br /><br />2. Hull recoat - Work Item 8: please clarify what constitutes the "hull" for this. Up to a certain line? Or all the way up to the top of the bulwarks? <br /><br />- Answer "The blasting and painting of the hull shall be from the deep load line to the keel, with the deep load line cut in at 14 ft. Also, the Contractor shall repaint all draft marks, legends, and plimsols, with one coat of white marine enamel paint." <br /><br />3. Fuel transfer - Work Item 11: is there somewhere on board the vessel that the 8000 gallons of fuel shall be transferred to? Or shall Contractor store it - to put back on the vessel? Or shall that fuel be replaced with new? By your agency or Contractor? <br /><br />-Answer "The Contractor shall be responsible for off-vessel storage all transferred fuel, then filter and return it to the tanks upon acceptance by the government of this item of work as complete." <br /><br />4. Fuel tanks - Work Item 11: please clarify what is meant by the term "siamesed together". <br /><br />- Answer "This is an error in the scope of work and refers to a different vessel. Delete the sentence 'The No. 2 center and starboard tanks are siamesed together,' and correct the reference to the 'Chetek' to read 'Cheraw.'" <br /><br />5. Fathometer - Work Item 15: we have been informed that the Furuno model ED222 is a "legacy" item - for which parts will no longer be made after 2010; and that their model RD30 is replacing that atquite a price reduction. Please advise if you still want Contractor to include the ED222 in pricing. <br /><br />- Answer "Please bid the item listed in the solicitation." <br /><br />Questions 10/19/2009 <br /><br />1. Looking at your draft in the spec and due to the time you want to dry dock your Tug we would have to put you in our small dock. If you can give me your bow and stern drafts of what you may be when you would get her. It would be great to know due to the water level we are at 14&rsquo;-3&rdquo; above our blocks but with the declivity you will to close with your bow. So if you can supply me with this information, we will decide if we should bid on your project. <br /><br />-Answer "The Contractor shall be responsible for providing a docking facility with sufficient draft for the vessel. With ballast tanks empty and minimal fuel aboard, the minimum draft requirements for the vessel are approximately 10 ft at bow and 14 ft at stern. The stern draft requirement can be reduced to approximately 13 ft by taking on ballast in the bow, but this increases the bow draft requirement. A deck load may be required to achieve a 13 ft stern draft, and shall be supplied by the Contractor if needed." 2. Item 8 CLEAN AND RECOAT THE HULL: Does the entire hull get painted or just up to the water line? Do fenders have to be removed? - Answer "Please refer to the answer to <br /><br />Question 2 from 10/16/2009. No fenders will need to be removed to perform this work." 3. Item 13 BEARING LINER RENEWAL (OPTIONAL): Does the liner have to be one piece or can it be made out of two pieces? - Answer "The liner shall be one piece." Questions 10/20/2009 1. ITEM 10 CLEANING OF FUEL TANKS (OPTIONAL) Does the 8000 gals of fuel get disposed of? - Answer "Please refer to the answer to Question 3 from 10/16/2009. Note that CLEANING OF FUEL TANKS (OPTIONAL) is ITEM 11, not ITEM 10." Part II. Correct final line of Solicitation <br /><br />"Drawings are located at ftp://ftp.usace.army.mil/pub/lrb/Tug%20Cheraw%20Drawings/," is hereby changed to "Drawings and Safety Specifications are located at ftp://ftp.usace.army.mil/pub/lrb/Tug%20Cheraw%20Drawings/."

The mission of the aircraft is to accomplish sea surveillance coverage to locate and provide a clear "shoot area" and provide for the relay of radio frequency transmissions between airborne mission vehicles (service and support aircraft, missiles, and drone targets) and ground-based sites. Normal crew is two pilots and two system operators. An alternate passenger configuration is approved for emergency hurricane evacuations. The primary mission systems are:<br />a) Sea Surveillance Radar (SSR) &amp; High Frequency (HF) Relay<br />b) Telemetry Relay System (TMRS) - There are no depot repair capabilities for some parts. <br />c) Drone Control &amp; Relay System/Data Link System (DLS)<br />d) UHF Relay System.<br />The contractor shall ensure the required functions are accomplished as follows:<br />1. Contractor Care of Government Furnished Facilities- The contractor shall clean their assigned facilities to maintain a neat, orderly and safe working environment free of fire and safety hazards<br />2.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Background &amp; Description</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Center (SMC) seeks to determine availability of the US industrial technology and manufacturing base to fulfill a need for a Lasercom Technical Demonstration (LTD) satellite system. LTD must demonstrate: a) a laser communications (Lasercom) capability, and b) a flexible, rapidly deployable, medium weight class geosynchronous satellite bus for LTD and other potential future demonstration payloads.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An LTD acquisition could potentially start in Government Fiscal Year 2011 (FY11), with the goal to provide on-orbit capability FY15 through FY20 that enables payload demonstration and evaluation and residual operational capability. Included are: a satellite bus with a high-rate IF/RF subsystem as a secondary payload, a Lasercom primary payload (supplied by a government laboratory or a contractor), satellite planning/control, and a high-rate deployable RF ground station.

<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Ann Reifman, Ph.D., 3000 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington DC 20008, for professional services of a clinician with expertise in schizophrenia. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 622210 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB) is part of the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, NIH. It is the principle research laboratory in the newly created (2003) Genes, Cognition, and Psychosis Program (GCAP) of the NIMH. CBDB is a multidisciplinary neuroscience laboratory in which basic and clinical scientists work side by side exploring neural mechanisms and models of mental and cognitive function and of neuropsychiatric illness. Experiments are performed at many levels of inquiry, from basic molecular biology of the gene to clinical examinations of patients. A major area of investigation of this laboratory is the genetic mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and its treatment.<br />
<p>The CBDB is seeking the services of a clinician with expertise in schizophrenia to be part of its large research project investigating schizophrenia and genetics. The contractor will conduct in depth interviews of patients with severe mental illness, siblings of these individuals and control subjects to determine accurate clinical diagnoses. Patient records will also be examined to further evaluate clinical diagnosis. The contractor will work to establish a clinical diagnostic procedure that better reflects research needs and increase the ability of subjects - many of whom are psychotic and paranoid - to answer difficult questions about their illness. The contractor will monitor research efforts in other institutions. The contractor is also responsible for determining whether an individual meets the CBDB's clinical diagnostic criteria in order to participate in the NIMH's study.</p>
<p>Starting in 1970 Dr. Reifman worked at the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia and later at the Neuropsychiatry branch, both of NIMH. Dr. Reifman had coordinated a Clinical Psychology Internship which focused on the treatment of people with severe mental illness.&nbsp;Dr. Reifman was voted by the mental health clinicians (including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers) in the Washington DC area to be one of a handful of top therapists for people with schizophrenia. Based on her previous experiences and involvement with the studies at NIMH, Dr. Reifman is considered highly qualified and best candidate for the requirement.</p>
<p>The period of performance is to be twelve (12) months from date of award. Place of performance is to be at the NIH main campus located in Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The type of this acquisition is a fee-for-service. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed above the said party may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 11:00 AM E.T., October 30, 2009 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference announcement number NOI-1307799 on all correspondence.<br /><br /><br />The purpose of the amendment is to correct the NAICS and its standard size.</p>

<DESC>To All Requestors of CC-GLAC001-10 Prospectus:
Errata No. 1 
1.  Contract Exhibit A, Draft Operating Plan, Supplemental A-2 (2009 Operating Dates/Hours and Rate Schedule) contains an asterisk for the rates listed for the Lake McDonald location.   The note refers the reader to Contract Operating Plan, Section VII. E.    The reader should have been referred to Contract Operating Plan, Section VI. E.
2.  Contract Exhibit A. Draft Operating Plan, Section III, B. should have included item 9.  Flotation Devices.  This section was inadvertently omitted and will be included when the Contract is finalized..9.  Flotation Devices.  In accordance with the recommendation of the US Coast Guard, the Concessioner will install and maintain flotation devices on each tour vessel sufficient to provide rescue in the event of the tour vessel capsizing.  The size and type of flotation device will depend on the size of the vessel, the approved passenger capacity, and the temperature of water on which the vessel operates.   
For the DeSmet (80 passenger vessel operated on Lake McDonald) and the Morning Eagle (49 passenger vessel operated on Lake Josephine) the following is required: 
- Provide a combination of Inflatable Buoyant Apparatus (IBA) and life floats such that the total capacity of the appliances will accommodate 100% of the passengers allowed per the US Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection.   
- When operating in cold water (mean temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit or less) the vessel must carry IBA of sufficient capacity to accommodate all of the passengers on board.  The passenger capacity of an approved IBA may be calculated at no more than 1.5 times the manufacturer's indicated capacity.  Given the average passenger count for the DeSmet in May and June (when water is colder), the IBA must have a manufacturer's rating of at least 20 people.  
-  The passenger capacity of approved life floats, will be accepted as the number indicated by the manufacturer.  
In addition, the following is required for the other vessels used by the existing concessioner:
Sinopah - life floats sufficient to accommodate 50% of the passengersChief Two Guns - life floats sufficient to accommodate 50% of the passengersLittle Chief - life floats sufficient to accommodate 50% of the passengersJoy II - life floats sufficient to accommodate 50% of the passengers 	Flotation device requirements for other vessels used in the operation will be determined in consultation with the US Coast Guard.
3. Contract Exhibit A, Draft Operating Plan, Section III, D. 14. Clarification: it is not required that any vessels added to the tour boat fleet be new. Vessels added to the tour boat fleet must be in conformance with USCG regulations and be assessable to visitors with special needs.
4. A math error was found in Exhibit C Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements (Concession Facilities). In addition, Replacement Value for Insurance for FMSS location number 93605, Rising Sun Building 1575 Boat Concession Housing was incorrect.  The correct Replacement Value for Insurance for this building is $27,510.   The total Replacement Value for Insurance for all the buildings is $1,841,803.

<DESC>To All Requestors of CC-GLAC001-10 Prospectus:
GLAC001-10 National Park Service Response to Questions submitted by:Glacier Park Boat Company, Inc. 
1.  In Exhibit C of the Draft Contract, "Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements", the total listed at the bottom of the chart on page C-2 is $1,809,417.  When added up the total is actually $1,892,191, a difference of $82,774.   Please clarify this difference.    
A math error was found in Exhibit C Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements (Concession Facilities). In addition, Replacement Value for Insurance for FMSS location number 93605, Rising Sun Building 1575 Boat Concession Housing was incorrect.  The correct Replacement Value for Insurance for this building is $27,510.   The total Replacement Value for Insurance for all the buildings is $1,841,803. This information is included in GLAC001-10 Errata No. 1.
2.  In Exhibit F of the Draft Contract, "Insurance", on page F-3, section III, A, 2 states that coverage for each vessel will be the "Replacement Cost, new for old, without deduction for depreciation."   Can you clarify that this means replacement with (for instance) an 80-passenger tour boat; not a replica of the DeSmet? 
That is correct.  The coverage for each vessel should be for the replacement of the vessel with one of similar make and function, but not a replica.  
3.  In the past NPS has resisted the idea of dragging another boat up the creek between Swiftcurrent and Josephine Lakes.  Yet we see no indication in the Prospectus indicating that the Morning Eagle is mandatory to provide the services of this contract.  Please clarify.  
Section 3.(a)(1) of the Draft Contract requires daily interpretive boat tours on Lake Josephine.   Contract Exhibit A, Supplemental A-1 authorizes one diesel powered tour boat with a capacity of 49 passengers plus 3 crew on Lake Josephine.   Should the Morning Eagle not be available for use, the Concessioner will need to submit a proposal to the Superintendent of how it will fulfill the requirements of the contract.   Alternatives for providing a vessel on Lake Josephine will be evaluated and a solution determined at that time.  Note:  Errata No. 1. Item 3. Vessels added to the tour boat fleet must be in conformance with USCG regulations and be assessable to visitors with special needs.
4.  Principal Selection Factor 3, Subfactor 3a, and Section IV, D, 2 in the Draft Operating Plan refer to the Alternative Boat Captain Licensing Procedures.  Please clarify if the successful bidder will continue to be required to employ at least one Licensed Master Captain, as per the current contract.  
Yes, the new Concessioner will be required to employ at least one Licensed Master Captain if it chooses to use the Alternative Boat Captain Licensing Procedures.   A modification to Exhibit A, Supplemental A-8, Alternative Boat Captain Licensing Procedures, will be made to include this requirement prior to finalizing the new contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to change the closing date from December 30, 2009 to January 5, 2010. Please read below.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for approximately 90 days with a new closing date of January 5, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST.  All questions for this requirement are due on October 30, 2009 at 3:00 pm EST. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.
Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below. No phone calls please.

<DESC>RECOVERY - The responsible contractor selected for this project will be required to develop an Innovative Facilities (IF) Online Environment which will provide information to interested users of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), as well as other governmental agencies and private sector developers to support decision making regarding sustainable building principles, materials and systems. 

The online environment will assist GSA in delivering world class work environments to tenant agencies and supports the requirement in the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 for the GSA Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to establish green practices that can be used throughout the life of a Federal facility.

The requirement includes the development of an online environment, which will offer the following:

a. Provide information and resources to support decision making regarding sustainable building principles, materials and systems; 
b. Enhance skill sets to assess lease submittals and architect/engineering design team deliverables; 
c. Promote the use of energy efficient and environmentally preferable materials and systems in GSA leases, renovations, and alterations; 
d. Provide sustainable design support for work place initiatives; and 
e. Support existing GSA green leasing initiatives.  


This project shall be awarded with a firm fixed price (FFP) contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. For this requirement, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is considered significantly more important than price. 

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the best value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.   

The below factors are listed in descending order of importance:
a. 	Technical Approach
b. 	Past Performance
c. 	Key Personnel

The combined technical factors of Past Performance and Key Personnel are of equal importance to Technical Approach.  In addition, the three (3) combined technical factors (Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Key Personnel) are significantly more important than Price. 

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 541511 (Webpage Design Services, Custom). The range for this project is estimated between $100,000 and $500,000. This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. 
 
Contractors interested in obtaining a copy of the solicitation package will be able to download electronic copies of the Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about October 30, 2009 on (www.fbo.gov). All questions must be submitted via email to nadya.popil@gsa.gov. All other forms of communication will not be considered. 
 
A pre-proposal conference will be held on November 18, 2009 @ 2:00 PM EST. This conference shall be held via conference call. Conference call information will be provided with the RFP.
