<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a Contract for the procurement of initial Training Device Spares (TDS) for the E-2C Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) Device 2F110 Serial Numbers (S/Ns) 1 and 2 located at Naval Station (NS) Norfolk, VA and Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Pt. Mugu, CA respectively under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The only source for the initial TDS is Aero Simulation, Inc. (ASI).  The anticipated contract value for this contract is $473,000. 

The procurement of these Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) components will ensure accurate functioning of the training device.
 Ensuring the availability of a material support package after the trainer has been upgraded is critical in fulfilling supportability requirements.  In the absence of the timely availability of spare parts, valuable training assets would not be available diminishing trainee effectiveness.  The spare parts must meet form, fit and function requirements to continue device operation and are available only from the OEM which is ASI.  

The Government does not possess the technical data to procure these initial TDS components competitively.  Substitution of these spare parts is not possible due to the form, fit, and functionality of the spare parts.

<RESPDATE>112312

<CONTACT>Debbie Lewis

<a href="mailto:Lewis.Debbie@epa.gov">lewis.debbie@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis, under the authority of FAR 6-302-1 with Horiba Instruments, Inc. for replacement of an existing  MEXA Analytical System for Vehicle Test Site 5.
The existing Horiba Instruments MEXA Analytical System in Vehicle Test Site 5 is based around an existing Horiba Instruments test control and data acquisition system (test cell host computer).  The Horiba Instruments CDTCS 500 test cell computer system performs many complex functions.  Among these functions is communication, control, and data acquisition of the existing Horiba Instruments MEXA Analytical system.  The test cell host computer utilizes a specialized unique set of drivers and command structure by the Horiba Instruments proprietary host communication protocol, MEXA-LAN.  In order for another vendor to compete for this solicitation, it would have to provide an Analytical System that responds to the same, extensive, set of computer commands that the Horiba Instrument MEXA system responds to.  Since this set of commands is part of the proprietary Horiba MEXA-LAN network protocol and the protocol is associated with Horiba proprietary software imbedded in Horiba MEXA s ystem, EPA does not believe another vendor would be capable of performing this requirement without a significant duplication of cost to the Government.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the requirements. Documentation must be submitted to the point of contact below within 15 calendar days of posting of this notice.
A determination not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 334516. Please submit relevant documentation in writing to: US EPA, ATTN: Debbie Lewis, 26 W. Martin Luther King, Mail Stop: Norwood, Cincinnati, OH 45268 or fax your documentation to (513) 487-2107, or email lewis.debbie@epa.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Research and Development, Technology Transfer Program intends to solicit a commercial requirement for its new legal and litigation services.  It is contemplated that this will be a multiple award IDIQ contract set aside for SDVOSB's and VOSB's; the government however reserves the right to make the final determination based on the number, type, and quality of proposals received.  

The Office of Research and Development (ORD) is the research arm of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The major emphasis of ORD is to advance VA medical research and development programs that address veterans' needs, with an emphasis on service-connected injuries and illnesses, and that contribute to the Nation's knowledge of disease and disability. A secondary benefit of these research endeavors is the transfer to the healthcare delivery system of new and beneficial technologies resulting from research conducted throughout the VA medical centers. Through its Technology Transfer Program (TTP) ORD facilitates the translation of VA discoveries into practice. TTP educates inventors on the process of translating discoveries into commercial products while facilitating disclosure of discoveries/ inventions, evaluates inventions, obtains patents, fosters CRADAs (Cooperative R&D Agreements), and facilitates the commercialization of these discoveries/ inventions. TTP is committed to the timely processing of invention disclosures and all subsequent actions required for bringing VA technologies to the marketplace.

TTP receives approximately 300 disclosures per year. Because of VA's historic close working relationship with affiliated academic medical centers, most of VA's inventions are jointly owned with our affiliates, who often take the lead in patenting and commercialization. This is facilitated by Cooperative Technology Administration Agreements that VA has entered into with over 60 leading affiliated academic medical centers. TTP directly manages about 20% of the disclosed inventions. The remainder are managed by our affiliates. TTP alone files approximately 30 patent applications each year, and receive approximately 5 issued patents. To date, VA or its affiliates have entered into over 200 licenses with companies to further develop VA owned inventions.

The VA has ownership of inventions discovered by VA investigators. These inventions require protection by patents which are costly to file, prosecute and maintain, and require professional expertise. These VA intellectual properties (IP) will only be protected by patents. Patent protection is critical in differentiating between products and also leads to licensing specific technologies.

This contract will provide the patent services required by TTP to protect VA owned intellectual property through patent filling and prosecution. These services will assist the VA TTP in developing and commercializing products that will ultimately be made available to veterans and the public. The VA TTP requires support to patent technologies invented within the VA.

The requirement may include a base year and four one-year option periods for a total of five years.  

More detailed information will be found in the solicitation document to include a detailed statement of work and other supporting documentation. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is late November 2012.

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1000. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small business to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished teaming partners.</p>
<p>2. This effort is to manufacture Initial Spare Parts for the Enhanced Wing Assembly (EWA). Contractor will manufacture and supply spare parts to the Air Force supply chain so they will be available to support EWA unique requirements until the Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) provisioning efforts can fulfill the spare requirements.</p>
<p>The Air Force requires EWA unique parts to support initial flying operations and testing of the new wing prior to provisioning efforts being completed and implemented. Therefore, this acquisition will be a contract to assure the short-term supportability of the EWA. Requirements for producing EWA parts include the demonstrated capability to manufacture according to 3D modeling information including tight tolerances. This 3D data is still in development and will be provided with short lead times requiring maximum flexibility in producing parts. Contractors will be required to demonstrate verification that 3D data imported to be used for manufacturing exactly matches organic source data. Contractors are also required to submit a technical data package demonstrating their ability to produce or utilize, if they have available, extensive tooling that is unique to the EWA assembly to assure proper end products and mating points/surfaces, and the flexibility to change manufacturing processes should a design change necessitate it. This tooling is estimated to cost contractors an initial investment over $20M and will not be available as GFE during the execution timeframe of this contract. The technical data package must also verify the Contractor's capability to manufacture the parts and qualify first articles. Contractors would also need to demonstrate their ability to deliver parts on a compressed time frame should demand necessitate it. The Contractor will be required to verify capabilities to manage component inventories, develop manufacturing testing (or demonstrate it if in place), and manufacture and test aerospace ready-for-use subassemblies with existing quality processes suitable for military aerospace applications. <br /><br />DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:<br /><br />&bull;Approximately 100 initial spare parts of varying quantities to establish the pipeline of EWA unique spare parts. <br /><br />&bull;The effort to produce initial spares has an estimated value of $3.6M with an estimated delivery period from March 2013 to October 2015.</p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall establish, implement, and maintain an Initial Spares Program in accordance with the listing of parts</p>
<p>&bull;The Data Item Descriptions (DID) DD Form 1664, and Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRL) DD Form 1423-1</p>
<p>&bull;When the prime contractor buys end articles or a portion thereof from a vendor/subcontractor, the prime contractor shall impose these specifications upon its vendors/subcontractors. The inclusion of the requirements on contractor's subcontracts/purchase orders to its vendor/subcontractors does not relieve the prime contractor of its obligation to insure timely delivery of the required deliverables.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is for planning purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or Proposals (RFP). The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding or in any subsequent exchange of information. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. All interested sources should provide a product brochure, company literature or information that details their product. All submissions should include company name and point of contact information (name, position, telephone number and email address). All interested parties with significant past performance experience in developing and maintaining radar simulators are encouraged to respond to this RFI by providing information on or before 1700 (EDST) on 29 November 2012. Responses to this RFI must be unclassified and shall not exceed forty (40) pages in length. All responses shall be transmitted electronically to the Procuring Contracting Officer, Mr. Frank Caltabilota, frank.s.caltabilota.civ@mail.mil. Technical questions may be addressed to Mr. Jody McCourt, 443-861-3115. <br /><br />The US Army, PM Radars is seeking sources and information regarding engineering support to: (1) complete the verification and validation of the Live Fire Test Simulator (LFTS) for use in testing the AN/TPQ-49 LCMR System; (2) modify the existing LFTS to accommodate the use of the simulator for the AN/TPQ-50 LCMR system acceptance testing; (3) troubleshoot reported problems; (4) incorporate hardware/software updates to accommodate LCMR production changes (firmware/software); (5) assist with maintenance and procurement of replacement and spare parts to ensure continuous availability of the simulator for LCMR acceptance testing; (6) update existing Maintenance and Operator manuals resulting from updates and system modifications; (7) generate trajectories; and (8) implement a configuration management system for hardware/software/firmware.<br /><br />Item Definition: Installed in late 2007 and formally accepted in 2008, the LFTS, installed at Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), PA, provides the means to perform acceptance testing for current and future LCMR systems. The simulator was designed and developed by Technology Service Corporation and is a key asset in the acceptance of new and repaired LCMR systems, eliminating the necessity for live fire testing. Use of the simulator eliminates shipping LCMR systems from the manufacturer's facility in Syracuse, NY to Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), AZ for acceptance testing. Verification and validation (V&amp;V) of the simulator is an extensive process comparing performance data of systems tested in the simulator with the performance data of those same systems when tested at the actual live fire range in YPG, AZ. There are three variants of the LCMR System: the AN/TPQ-48A, the AN/TPQ-49 and the AN/TPQ-50. The simulator has been successfully validated for testing the AN/TPQ-48. The Government is currently in the process of validating use of the simulator to test the AN/TPQ-49 systems. The simulator requires hardware and software modifications to operate with the newer AN/TPQ-50 systems without degrading the test results from the earlier versions of the LCMR. <br /><br />The resultant contract will require the Contractor to provide the Government with a test plan for conducting tests, assist with data collection at the TYAD facility and provide a written test report documenting the results of these tests. Test plans and metrics established during the previous verification and validation (V&amp;V) exercises shall be used as the basis for these tests. Once the simulator modifications for the AN/TPQ-50 are completed, data has been collected and testing has proven out the simulator, the V&amp;V process will then commence prior to formal acceptance.<br /><br />As well as providing information to support your knowledge, expertise and significant past performance experience in developing and maintaining radar simulators, interested potential offerors shall provide an objective maintenance plan for the LFTS for all existing LCMR versions, describing the efforts required to ensure continued operations and identifying the types of normal maintenance functions required.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought Notice is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for a Quote (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Letterkenny Army Depot is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Negative replies are also sought. Contractor should not include any pricing.
<p>Letterkenny Army Depot is seeking information concerning the availability of capable contractors to supply the following items:</p>
<p>0001. Fuse igniter, pull string type. Disposable, one time use. Consists of a small diameter paper tube which contains an ignition cup, pull wire, fuse grip ferrule and fuse stop ferrule. On the outside of the smaller paper tube is a paper sleeve with a safety clip and white plastic safety cap attached. The device functions by pulling the pull wire through the igniter cup which causes the igniter cup to ignite in a manner similar to a safety match. The ignition of the igniter cup effects ignition of the safety fuse. As the name suggests, the fuse stop ferrule prevents the fuse from being inserted too far into the lighter. The Fuse Igniter is for one time use and will work with commercial or military M700 type time fuse.</p>
<p>UN ID: UN0131<br />Class: 1.4S<br />Net explosive weight: .11 lbs (.05 kg) per 1,000 WPI<br />Shelf life: 4 Years in unopened barrier bag<br />Temperature range: -20 deg F(-29 deg, C) to 120 deg. F (49 deg, C)<br /><br />Omni part number BFA-PSI-100. Brand name only.</p>

<p>GSA is inviting large publishers and resellers to submit information, feedback, and recommendations on the implementation of new FSSI SmartBUY software BPAs.

<p><strong>TITLE:</strong> Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) Technology Refresh</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF DESCRIPTION:</strong> AVCATT is a virtual, reconfigurable, trailerized simulation training system. In a stand-alone configuration or networked with multiple virtual and constructive simulation systems, (e.g., Close Combat Tactical Trainer- CCTT, Virtual Battlespace 2- VBS2, Call for Fire Trainer- CFFT) it provides the capability for aviation units to train and sustain performance of the critical collective tasks that support the battlefield functional areas of maneuver, maneuver support, and maneuver sustainment and their associated Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) of intelligence, Fire Support (FS), air defense, mobility/counter mobility/survivability, combat service support, and command and control.</p>
<p>PEO STRI Product Manager for Air and Command Tactical Trainers (PM ACTT) has a requirement to keep the equipment in the AVCATT system up to date and technologically relevant. Therefore, the APM AVCATT is seeking information from industry regarding the replacement of HMDs in the 2017-2018 timeframe. As documented in the attached draft Technical Specification document, two key areas of improvement desired over the current implementation are the following:</p>
<p>1. Increased resolution beyond 1280x1024 <br /><br />2. Lifecycle costs <br /><br />The current product in AVCATT is the Rockwell SR100A with an integrated InterSense IS-900 MiniTrax. Each Manned Module utilizes 2 HMDs and an InterSense tracking system. <br /><br /><strong>INTENT OF THIS RFI:</strong> To collect responses from interested offerors to provide HMD replacements for the AVCATT system.

<p>This is a design-bid-build project.<br />The North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) is 237990 -- Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. This requirement will be awarded as a firm fixed price construction contract. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This market survey is to determine the constructability and logistical requirements for the proposed breakwater repair. The Government may use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make an appropriate acquisition decision for this project. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement may depend on the responses to this sources sought synopsis.<br />Respondents should also consider the geographical location of this project. Construction contracts awarded by the Army Corps of Engineers require compliance with EM 385-1-1 Safety Manual.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />A. Name of firm with address, phone number, point of contact, CAGE code or DUNS number. Indicate whether or not your firm is a U.S. firm or a foreign firm.<br />B. Size of firm including category of small business, such as 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, or SDVOSB, large business. <br />C. Firm's Bonding Capability and Capacity, in terms of U.S. dollars (performance and payment bonds will be required).<br />D. Background information: This project will rehabilitate and repair an existing breakwater located in Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor, on the island of Hawaii. The work will require existing 30-ton armor units to be removed and reset into place. It is assumed that the crane shall be operated on the location shown on the attached plan. There exists the possibility that two (2) 30-ton concrete armor units will become interlocked and be lifted inadvertently while the crane is attempting to remove a single armor unit. It is the contractor's responsibility to replace armor units that are damaged during the removal process. The State/County roadway systems generally consists of two (2) lanes (one lane each direction, with 11 to 12 feet wide lanes). The access road to the small boat harbor is approximately 15 feet wide with a typical grade of approximately 2% with some areas having a grade up to 5%. There exists a 10-ton capacity bridge (15 feet wide x 50 feet long) over a stream crossing along the access road to the project site.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the crane needed for this project will be mobilized from off island and will be transported by vessel to Hilo Harbor. The crane and required supplies/material shall then be transported on existing State and Local roadways from Hilo Harbor to Laupahoehoe Small Boat Harbor.</p>
<p>E. Answer specifically the following market survey questions:</p>
<p>1. Does the contractor have previous experience with placement/handling of concrete armor units in a marine environment? Provide a brief synopsis of the previous experience. Ensure the following is covered, description and location of project; type and weight of armor unit; approximate contract cost; contractor's role, i.e. was the work accomplished by the contractor or was the contractor's previous experience as a prime and armor work done by a sub-contractor.</p>
<p>2. Does the contractor have access to equipment to accomplish the work given the constraints noted in the project description? If yes, what are the dimensions and weight of such equipment? What model of equipment would be used for the work?</p>
<p>3. What is maximum reach of the equipment for estimated 30-ton armor units, and 60-ton armor units, should two (2) units be interlocked?</p>
<p>4. Can the equipment and necessary supplies/materials be transported to the project site intact? <br />a. Does the weight of the equipment and supplies/material exceed the allowable bridge capacity? If yes, what measures would be taken to reinforce the bridge? <br />b. OR If the equipment has to be broken down for transport, what is the approximate area of the footprint required to reassemble the equipment at the project site?</p>
<p>5. What is the height clearance of the equipment and supplies/material during transport when mounted on trailer?</p>
<p>6. Is there adequate work area for the crane to operate safely in at the work site? If no, describe the approximate area of that is required for the equipment for its intended use? How much clearance is needed in areas adjacent to equipment to maneuver?</p>
<p>7. If given a specific location (x/y coordinates) for placement of an armor unit's centroid, describe the following: <br />a. How would a contractor accomplish such placement<br />b. What type of navigational equipment will be used, <br />c. What would be the expected accuracy of placement position? <br />d. What type of slinging mechanism/configuration would be used to remove/reset existing armor units on structure?</p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:<br />1. Would the work still require the same type of equipment as the above? If no, what type of equipment would be used if access is permitted on the rib cap and what are the dimensions of the equipment?</p>
<p>2. Would temporary measures be required to work safely on the 11 feet wide cap? If yes, describe the measures that would be used to work safely on the cap.</p>
<p>3. If permitted to work off of the rib cap, any damages sustained to the rib cap will be the contractor's responsibility. Therefore, what measures would the contractor take to prevent damages to the rib cap?</p>

<p>The work consists of providing all labor, technical expertise, materials, equipment, scaffolding and appurtenances necessary to accomplish the following:<br />The Little Goose north shore fishway entrance (NSE) weirs are used to maintain a head differential between the fish ladder and the river. Operation of the north shore fishway entrance weir hoist machinery and electrical panel operation is a remote control activity that is constantly exposed to moisture from the spray and waves from spill bay 8, as well as from the weather. Existing hoists are original to the facility and have failed and been removed from operation. Current manual operations are accomplished with Temporary A-frame chain fall hoist systems.</p>
<p>This contract will remove and dispose of the remaining failed hoist equipment and upgrade the 2 weir hoists machinery by replacement with a newly designed system. Remaining supports and palletized failed hoist equipment has confirmed lead paint coating. Hoist hardware removal includes metal support structure removal; grout base and anchor bolt removal to deck surface, and electrical conduit and box removal as necessary. The contractor will be required to dispose of failed hoist equipment in a safe legal manner. The temporary A-frame chain fall hoist systems will remain Government property.</p>
<p>New hoists will be fabricated, delivered, installed, and tested for working capacity of 15,000 pounds in accordance with applicable Corps of Engineers and industry standards. Work will include replacing water level sensors; replacing limit switches; adding limit switch redundancy; adding cable slack sensors; installing associated control circuitry and integrating the new control components with the existing control system; using spare conduit, if serviceable, to bring in a second power feeder for second hoist instead of branching off a single power feed for both hoists. Work will include providing NEMA 4 electrical enclosures to eliminate exposure to moisture and framework or enclosure to protect hoist equipment from water borne debris impact. The slack rope detection will cut off the power to the system, regardless of perceived weir position, when the rope goes slack and prevent the rope from unspooling and becoming entangled in the gear drive components. On-site work will occur during the January-February 2014 fish window. Hoise rated capacity 15,000 lbs (Could be 2 synchronized 7500-pound hoists); Full load lifting speed 30+/-1 per minute; Hoist maximum lift is 25 feet, 6 inches; Power is 480 Volt, 3-Phase.</p>
<p>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual.</p>
<p>NAICS Code 238290, Small Business Size Standard is no more than $14,000,000 in average annual receipts over the past 3 fiscal years. This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify large and small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work. Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement of their current or past technical experience (what the firm has done) and current or past performance (how well the firm did it) similar to or the same as the requirements stated above, will be used in the determination whether to set aside this requirement for small business.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN NEW LONDON, CT. This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs with regard to the planned execution of an NAIS Live Dataflow Network and System Analysis contract. It is anticipated that this effort will result in the award of a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a performance period of five years. It is anticipated that the effort required over the five-year period may be in the range of $9M.<br /><br />The RDC is the Coast Guard's (CG's) sole facility performing Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) in support of CG major missions of Maritime Law Enforcement, Maritime Safety, Marine Environmental Protection and National Security. The RDC's Automatic Identification System (AIS) project in New London, CT, is currently evaluating the performance of AIS technology for use by the USCG NAIS and developing methods that can improve performance and capabilities of the NAIS. <br /><br />Past AIS research has produced an operating network consisting of remote equipment installations, software, analysis and data access methods that need to be expanded to meet USCG operational needs. The RDC's previous work resulted in the development of the USCG NAIS Interim Receive (IR) System. The USCG's ongoing acquisition of expanded NAIS reception and transmit capabilities is designated as NAIS Permanent Transceive (PT) System. This expansion includes the transfer of capabilities and responsibilities to USCG operators and facilities outside of the research program. Final expansion of NAIS is designated as the Long Range Receive (LRR) System. <br /><br />In support of the NAIS program, the RDC is responsible for: continued development and maintenance of the NAIS software used in both the Interim and PT Systems; documentation for future support of the software outside of the research program; and, assessment of the NAIS network surveillance performance.<br /><br />The RDC is seeking information on companies that have the capability to augment the capacity and enhance the technological expertise of the RDC in the area of AIS data analysis; AIS real-time data networking; operation and maintenance of the (RDC) Analysis website; system administration, modifying AIS software and maintenance of existing USCG NAIS software; AIS lab and field work supporting the RDC AIS; and physical receiver and transmitter experimentation to improve system performance. <br /><br />

Real-time AIS Data Network Operations - The contractor shall maintain the continued real-time data reception, aggregation, and distribution of AIS data and metadata in the NAIS network while ensuring protocol compliance with the National Marine Equipment Association (NMEA) 0183 standards. A consistent level of NAIS service and availability is accomplished through the utilization of multiple data servers running Windows XP, Windows 7, Server 2003, and Server 2008 operating systems. This real-time data service runs on a 24/7 schedule; however, contractor support shall be provided on an 8/5 schedule. The contractor shall maintain systems integrity, perform maintenance, and manage system security on all data servers and systems to ensure continuous operations. The contractor shall maintain and update the documentation describing the RDC AIS network infrastructure. The contractor shall respond for all casualties and resolve. The contractor shall provide technical support for all required changes to the AIS and NAIS operations on the RDC network.</p>
<p>B. AIS Data Service Feeds to NAIS - The NAIS consists of USCG-owned sources or sites of AIS data as well as other Government agencies and commercial sources of AIS data. Non-CG sources typically do not conform to NMEA 0183 ver. 4.0 protocols used within NAIS. The contractor shall process reception of disparate AIS data feeds ensuring compliance to the NMEA 0183 standard, real-time data validation, data analysis, data archiving, and forwarding to the operational NAIS. The contractor shall configure and customize USCG NAIS software as required to establish non-standard and new data forwarding connections to the USCG NAIS system.</p>
<p>C. AIS Data Monitoring and Analysis - The contractor shall conduct analyses on both operationally provided AIS data and data originating from non-operational sources including AIS metadata to ensure the preservation of the integrity and reliability of the NAIS network. The contractor shall perform individual and comparative analyses of NAIS network and site reception performance daily on the following: NAIS IR System; NAIS IR to PT System comparative reception; NAIS PT System reception and transmission; satellite based AIS (S-AIS); and third party commercial AIS receivers. From these analyses, the contractor shall produce daily comparisons and visualizations and then publish them to the RDC Analysis website. The contractor shall monitor the network connections daily. The contractor shall perform analyses of AIS vessel track data for the purpose of supporting risk assessments and incident investigations.</p>
<p>D. Maintenance of NAIS Software - Current USCG NAIS software works both inside and outside of the USCG LAN and WAN network and operates natively on multiple operating systems. The contractor shall modify and update the customized and complex NAIS software, including configuring in the field. The stability and integrity of the NAIS operational network is heavily dependent on the proper function and interrelated communications of the USCG NAIS software. The contractor shall update, modify, maintain, and expand the existing USCG NAIS data analysis and filtering capability, and the RDC Analysis website software as required. The contractor shall develop and test new versions of USCG NAIS and analysis website software as required to maintain real-time network operations while ensuring compliance with NMEA 0183 ver. 4.0 protocol. <br /><br />E. Lab and Field Work- The contractor shall perform testing of receiver and transmitter antennas, software and site configurations. The contractor shall install experimental AIS and standard NAIS equipment, and proactively detect and troubleshoot NAIS network issues. The contractor shall provide system efficiency improvement recommendations based on testing and experimental activities. The contractor shall provide electronic technical support services as needed to maintain the RDC's AIS laboratory network infrastructure; server configuration; server setup; and NAIS network connections.</p>
<p>F. Experimental AIS Technical Improvements - The contractor shall research and investigate potential improvements for the NAIS through physical infrastructure development, and improvements in RF reception and transmission technologies including transmitters, receivers, and antennas. The contractor shall investigate and demonstrate methods to improve AIS surveillance coverage in areas of high VHF Data Link (VDL) loading including long range reception and VDL Slot usage.</p>

<p><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009.

Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of this initiative was to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. The initial data was obtained from the 12-month cost report filed at that time. As cost reports are continually accepted during the year, MAC's shall update the data in the FISS within 5 business days of acceptance.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because of uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permits costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a Firm-Fixed Price, sole source IDIQ contract to SRI International under the authority set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). <br /><br />The Joint Nuclear Security Evaluation Program (JNSEP) is a series of physical security evaluations conducted by DTRA in coordination with other Government agencies/services that includes force-on-force exercises, engineering studies of physical security features, and modeling &amp; simulation designed to evaluate the adequacy of the United States nuclear weapons security practices, policies and procedures. These exercises provide for a realistic combat training environment simulating real time position locations for participants and vehicles involved in this weapons security exercise. In order to successfully execute these exercises, DTRA requires utilization of the SRI FlexTrain exercise communications and personnel tracking system as well as the associated logistical planning and integration of the associated Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) system to capture real time personnel tracking and exercise data collection and analysis. The FlexTrain system is the system of record utilized in these multiagency/multiservice JNSEP exercise events and possesses the required technical specifications inclusive of 2D/3D modeling, audio/video tracking, and required integration with the MILES system. Successful execution of the JNSEP exercises requires utilization of identical tracking systems to ensure congruity and uniformity of the real time tracking/analysis of the exercise personnel, training of users, as well as consistency in the data/analysis gathered and evaluated in the After Action Reports. As the design agent and manufacturer of the FlexTrain system, only SRI possesses the requisite technical knowledge, maintenance, logistics planning, and calibration support for the FlexTrain system as well as these support elements for the MILES system.

<DESC>Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to increase the ceiling on the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE) Exercise Support Services IDIQ with Cubic Applications, Inc. (CAI) under contract HDTRA1-04-D-0020 under the authority set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). As a result of unanticipated increases in the quantity of Foreign Consequence Management (FCM), Nuclear Weapons Accident / Incident Exercise (NUWAIX) and Consequence Management Assistance Program (CMAP) events in FY13-14, the Government requires an increase in the ceiling of the IDIQ to ensure immediate and continued support of current and scheduled FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP efforts in FY13-14. This increase results in no change to the ordering period of the IDIQ which continues through July of 2014.<br /><br />As CAI has over eight years' experience in the planning, development, and execution of FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP efforts, only CAI possesses the in-depth knowledge and expertise required to plan, develop, and execute the current and scheduled FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP requirements. Further, as the current performer and executor of these highly specialized / niche counter CBRNE Exercise Support services, CAI is the only source capable of fulfilling the Government's requirements, cost and other factors considered. It should be noted that due to current and anticipated growth in this program, DTRA intends to re-compete this prior to expiration of the ordering period.<br />&nbsp;

This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 7 November 2013 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and potential contributions to the Navy Propulsion, Power and Energy objectives to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for transition; (4) suitability for transition to Navy systems; and (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance but equal to each other are; The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and the realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. One original and three copies of each WP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 120-180, Code 2.5.2.3.2, Attn: Jillian Kohler, jillian.kohler@navy.mil , Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regard to this requirement. The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

<a href="mailto:Harris.Robin@epa.gov">Harris, Robin S</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with IntegenX, 5720 Stoneridge Drive, Suite 300, Pleasanton, CA 94588 to provide an IntegenX Apollo 324 library preparation system and development software, Psuite.  The EPA laboratory located at Research Triangle Park, NC has been equipped with an integrated Illumina HT HiScanSQ sequencing system and smaller bench top Illumina MiSeq sequencer including a scanner and microfluidic system components which provides comprehensive genomic services to EPA scientists. As a part of the large GRC sequencing suite, the Apollo 324 will allow preparation of the library of sequencing samples before using it in the big HiScan SQ system  or small Mi seq system. It will speed up the preparation time from several weeks to several hours.  No other existing bench top library preparation systems interface with the existing Illumina platform  and meets the following requirements:  System must have multiple validated, build-in protocols and reagents available for touch screen operation for the Illumina? Hi Scan SQ & MiSeqTM platforms; system architecture must be flexible to adapt to new applications and protocols as they are developed; system must have two modes of operation to (1) process from 1 to 8 samples at a time in 1.5 hours or less and (2) process up to 32 samples at a time in 4 hours (64 samples per day); system must be able to perform library prep from gDNA, total RNA, and ChIP samples to meet the specific library sample quality and quantity requirements for the above mentioned NGS sequencers; library preparation protocol must be able to accept standard and custom adapters; size range must be system selectable; system must have an automated magnetic bead-based capture mechanism to perform in-tip library reactions and cleanups to eliminate DNA cross contamination; system must have dual-zone heating and cooling capability to maintain enzyme st ability for optimal performance; system must have safety interlocks; system must offer a software solution to allow for customer programming; library preparation protocol must be tunable by operator;  and resultant protocol can be locked as needed by operator.  Since the IntegenX Apollo 324 library prep system interfaces with the existing EPA platform and meets the system requirements, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for this particular system.  The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" at this time is FAR 13.501(a), "sole source".  The anticipated delivery is 7 days from receipt of purchase order.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required system and software should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The in tent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<RESPDATE>112312
<CONTACT>Sarah K. Ignacio, Phone 5023156174, Email sarah.k.ignacio@usace.army.mil
<DESC><p>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $40 million). The project consists of the Design/Bid/Build construction of a 1,200-member Army Reserve Center (ARC) at Fort Lewis, WA. Primary facilities include construction of an ARC training building and Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS). A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades; b. The complexity of the project; c. Shortage of skilled labor in region; d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time; e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects; f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects; g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion; and h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br />The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br />a. Should a PLA be executed on the Army Reserve Center (ARC) at Fort Lewis, WA contract? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br />b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br />c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br />d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br />e. The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br />f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br />g. Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br />i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br />Responses shall be submitted via email to Sarah Ignacio at sarah.k.ignacio@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM Louisville Time (EST) on 23 November 2012. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 14, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after July 14, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated June 14, 2012 (Refresh #19) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after July 14, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-L3-030084-B (include the dashes). The solicitation is entitled Schedule 084: Total Solutions for Law Enforcement, Security, Facilities Management, Fire, Rescue, Special Purpose Clothing, Marine Craft and Emergency/Disaster Response.  The products/services addressed in this solicitation are: FSC Group 19, Marine Craft and Equipment, Inboard and Outboard Engines, Towable Bladders and Floating Marine Barriers, and Buoys (Attachment 01), FSC Group 42, Firefighting and Rescue Equipment, Urban and Wildland (Attachment 02), FSC Group 63, Alarm and Signal Systems/Facility Management Systems, Professional Security/Facility Management Services, and Guard Services (Attachment 03); FSC Group 84, Special Purpose Clothing (Attachment 04), and FSC Group 84, Law Enforcement and Security Equipment (Attachment 05).  The basic solicitation includes clauses, which are applicable to the solicitation/resultant contract. The basic solicitation has multiple attachments pertaining to various aspects of the solicitation.  Offerors must complete and return all exhibits or attachments applicable to the product/services, which they intend to offer.  Please read the attachment entitled, Information and Instructions to Offerors, for information and instructions on completing the solicitation and attachments. 

This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding Fee provisions. The Trade Agreements clause applies to this solicitation.  No items are set aside for small business in this solicitation.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP)
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION, WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER
2297-HV02	2. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
C-130	3. ESTIMATED AMOUNT (OVER $2,500 BUT NOT EXCEEDING $100,000)

4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE.

Modification of RT-1341(V)3/ARC190, P/N: 622-4956-103 to an RT-1341(V)8/ARC190, P/N: 622-5985-001. The TR-1341(V)8/ARC190 is used on the HC-130H and HC130J Aircraft as the Primary High Frequency Communication Radio. 

5. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED.
The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190, P/N: 622-4956-103 and the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190, P/N: 622-5985-001 are manufactured by Rockwell Collins, Inc. located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190 is used currently by the HC130H model aircraft and the RT-1341(V)8/ARC 190 is currently used by the HC130J model aircraft and the HC130H aircraft modified with the Avionics Block One Upgrade. The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190 is an older version of the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190. Both radios have been installed on the HC130H and J model aircraft as part of their original equipment configuration at the time of purchase of the HC130 Coast Guard fleet. The USCG does not intend to replace this system on either aircraft. Rockwell Collins is the sole manufacture of the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190 Modification Kit, P/N: 752-5559-001 used to upgrade the RT-1341(V)3/ARC190. Rockwell Collins does not sell this kit to any other source and is the only authorized vender to install this kit. Rockwell Collins is the OEM. They hold the engineering data, specifications, and drawings required to modify this radio. 

 
6. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES

Rockwell Collins, Inc is the OEM. Rockwell Collins is the only supplier of the RT-1341(V)8/ ARC190 Modification Kit, P/N: 752-5559-001. Rockwell Collins owns the technical data and drawings necessary to perform this work as the OEM. Market research did not indicate that any other sources were available. 

 
7. EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

The Coast Guard did not purchase the technical data and drawing necessary to support this work. Rockwell Collins, Inc. is the OEM for this material. Any additional market research is not expected to produce different results.

8. PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED.  IF THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON ACTION TO A PREVIOUSLY COMPETED ACTION, SO STATE.
The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition. It would not be cost effective to acquire the drawings and data package in order to compete this requirement. The RT-1341(V)8/ARC190 Modification Kit is manufactured solely by Rockwell Collins. The Coast Guard will maintain open communication with Rockwell Collins and will continue market research to identify possible sources capable of providing this equipment modification service.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. <br />(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract. <br />(p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items. <br />(q) Other compliances.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after THE LAST DAY OF THE EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. <br />OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) <br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>2852.223-70 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br />Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)<br />(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.<br />(e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues.

The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.<br />(i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.<br />(j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

These gels do not contain SDS and can therefore be used to accurately separate both native Moreand denatured proteins. Novex? Tris-Glycine Gels provide reproducible separation of a wide range of proteins into well-resolved bands. Formulation: Novex? Tris-Glycine Gels are made with high-purity, strictly quality-controlled reagents: Tris base, HCl, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, APS, and highly purified water.

Use NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gels for protein sequencing, mass spectrometry, and any other techniques where protein integrity is crucial. The NuPAGE System also provides the most efficient means for transferring proteins to membranes for subsequent analysis. Formulation: The NuPAGE System is based upon a Bis-Tris-HCl buffered (pH 6.4) polyacrylamide gel, with a separating gel that operates at pH 7.0. While NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gels do not contain SDS, they are formulated for denaturing gel electrophoresis applications only.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC><strong>AMMENDMENT: In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows:<br /></strong><br />The Government requirement is for 29 cubicle stations and miscellaneous components that are fully compatible and interchangeable with the current Herman Miller Canvas Office Landscape cubicle stations. The manufacturers produce cubicle stations and components in accordance with their own proprietary specifications, which are not compatible or interchangeable other manufacturers cubicle stations. Compatibility with the existing systems furniture and hardware is essential now and for future reconfigurations necessitated by organizational restructuring, changes in manpower or relocation. The only known source able to meet the Governments requirement is Herman Miller Inc.
<p>The Government believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Currently, there are 760 Herman Miller Canvas Office Landscape stations installed with an estimated total value of $2.9M. Acquiring Herman Miller Canvas Office Landscape stations will allow interchangeability of all components of all stations in the inventory, thus maximizing flexibility and minimizing the potential for obsolescence of some stations or components thereof when office layouts are reconfigured due to reorganizations, manpower fluctuations or transfer of entire offices' systems furniture to new facilities. This would allow for known future changes, modifications and/or expansion of the current configurations by utilizing these compatible components from the other offices without requiring potentially expensive and duplicative purchases in the future.</p>
__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344, publishes this Sole Source synopsis for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of a 29 Cubicle Stations and components, the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 337214 Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Herman Miller Inc., 855 East Main Ave., PO BOX 302, Zeeland, MI 49464-0302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System For Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 21 May 1998. You may contact SAM at 1-866-606-8220, or https://www.sam.gov <br />

<DESC><strong>Description:</strong> The United States Air Force (USAF), Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG), 771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron Services Flight, Knowledge Based Services Commodity Council (KBSCC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding potential future solicitation for Knowledge Based Services (including Advisory and Assistance Services). The future solicitation strategy may provide an Air Force wide solution using temporary employment service workers in the United States.
<p>This is a <strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SYNOPSIS</strong>. This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, or a solicitation, and is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> to be constructed in any way as a commitment by the Government. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is</span></strong> a request for information to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources plus obtain insight on the nature of the industry. Responses to this RFI will assist in the development and structure of the ESG acquisition strategy prior to issuing any RFP. The Government will <strong>not pay</strong> respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents are also advised that submitting a capability package implies express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals for Government purposes. The Government highly encourages all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE</strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice, or to otherwise pay for information that is submitted. If the Government decides to contract for this effort, it will issue a RFP at a later date. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of publicizing this RFI notice is to aid in the development of the ESG KBS acquisition strategy, increase competition to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and gather information for planning purposes about the temporary employment market or capabilities as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The ESG is tasked with developing strategic sourcing solutions for the Air Force. The ESG KBS Commodity Council is investigating the availability of Temporary Service Firms, Advisory &amp; Assistance Service Firms, and cost saving opportunities.</p>
<p>Preliminary research suggests that the scope of any future contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, we seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing similar services. The input will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offers. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes/spend (3 year average annual receipts) suggest the potential classification code 561320, size standard $13.5M. Firms responding to this announcement shall indicate their business size for code 561320, particularly if they are a small business.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Provide cross-functional installation strategic sourcing and acquisition solutions that identify cost effective and time savings methods to acquire Knowledge Based Services - Temporary Staffing.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Knowledge Based Services (KBS), commonly referred to as Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), relates to tasks that require the application of detailed processes, technical knowledge, professional support, consultation, or staff assistance. The objective of the KBSCC is to develop a strategic process for temporary employment services that can provide required temporary staff for all eligible AF customers. Federal law establishes that an agency may use a temporary help service firm(s) in a single situation initially for no more than 120 workdays. Provided the situation continues to exist beyond the initial 120 workdays, the agency may extend its use of temporary help services up to the maximum limit of 240 workdays.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Capabilities Package:</strong> The ESG Knowledge Based Services Commodity Council is requesting your input to gather information to help us refine our requirements and to identify qualified parties who might be able to meet our future temporary employment requirements. Interested sources should complete the attached capability package, with information that demonstrates the companies experience to successfully provide the necessary temporary staffing services for the AF. This RFI allows the opportunity to provide input and recommendations consistent with your service offerings, industry trends, and cost saving suggestions. All parties with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth herein are invited to provide data on the capabilities of your company. The capabilities package should present clear evidence that the interested party is fully capable of meeting the requirements, and as such may contain any information the interested party feels is relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Capabilities Package Requirements:</strong> The Air Force has structured this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain industry feedback on the capabilities of the industry. Attachment 1 (Capability Package) was developed to obtain what we anticipate will be useful information as the KBS Commodity Council strategy is developed, while not requiring an undo level of effort from industry. The attached excel spreadsheet (Capability Package) is set up for your responses and any additional comments you may have. Please complete and return the spreadsheet to the email address below.</p>
<p>The Air Force will not accept or acknowledge: e-mails over 2MB, brochures, samples, catalogs and any other marketing solicitation information.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation basis:</strong> Responses will not be evaluated, but are for the purpose of gathering information to help refine our requirements and acquisition strategy, as wells as to identify qualified parties who might be able to meet our future requirements. Following submittal of this capability package, AF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents. Such communications would only be intended to support USAF market research by obtaining further clarification of industry capability to meet requirements.</p>
<p><strong>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR SOLICIATION MATERIAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> The spreadsheet (capability package) must be received in the contracting office not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 10 JAN 2013.

<p>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor CGS under the current contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0002Z in the amount of $3,910 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and technical capability of qualified business sources. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 with a small business size standard of $14 million. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research ONLY. <br /><br />1.0 BACKGROUND<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) develops and maintains the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) which is a part of TOXNET, a group of databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health and toxic releases. HSDB focuses on the toxicology of potentially hazardous chemicals. It is enhanced with information on human exposure, industrial hygiene, emergency handling procedures, environmental fate, regulatory requirements, nanomaterials, and related areas. All data are referenced and derived from a core set of books, government documents, technical reports, selected primary journal literature and other sources. HSDB is peer-reviewed by the Scientific Review Panel (SRP), a committee of experts in the major subject areas within the data bank's scope. HSDB is organized into individual chemical records, contains over 5000 such records and is accessible free of charge, via TOXNET at: http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov<br /><br />2.0 PURPOSE and OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this procurement is to receive professional services to obtain information on the environmental fate and exposure of chemicals and/or substances and related information such as chemical physical properties, production, manufacturing, risk assessment and end use in products. This effort requires detailed knowledge of environmental fate and exposure sources and proven experience with environmental fate estimation models, and chemical risk assessment.<br /><br />The Hazardous Substances Data Bank has approximately 150 data fields that are grouped into sections which include specific data. The information and services obtained in this procurement are to populate Section 3 (Chemical and Physical Properties), Section 7 (Environmental Fate and Exposure), and portions of other Sections when that data relates to the information and/or sources used in Sections 3 and 7. All information obtained for these sections are to be entered into the NLM/SIS provided Specialized Information Services Edit/Update System, SSEUS, for review. Section numbers are for sections as labeled in SSEUS, not the public HSDB Table of Contents sections. The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br /><br />1. Identify and compile all data and information necessary to populate Sections 3 and 7. See http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/help/hsdbf.htm for a description of HSDB data fields where sections are listed in boldface. Coordination with the primary HSDB contractor will be necessary. This information is required for new and existing HSDB records that need to be updated. Access to SSEUS will be given at time of award for all data delivery.
<p>2. Identify and compile all data and information necessary to populate portions of other fields related to information in Sections 3 and 7 such as, but not limited to, manufacturing, production, use and export data in Section 2. Coordination with the primary HSDB contractor will be necessary.</p>
<p>3. Summarize the fate and exposure of chemicals in the environment. In the absence of experimental values, estimate and calculate environmental values.</p>
<p>4. Efficiently retrieve full text articles from environmental databases, extract portions of the articles for HSDB and refer to the articles during peer review meetings while consulting with subject matter experts and the NLM HSDB team.</p>
<p>5. Provide health effects and toxicology information available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) such as Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions (TSCATS) and other government agencies.</p>
<p>6. Provide a Senior Environmental Scientist for attendance at the Scientific Review Panel (SRP) meetings and provide an Information Specialist as needed at the SRP meetings. The SRP normally meets for 3 days, 3 times a year.</p>
<p>7. Identify chemicals or substances which may be hazardous to the public and the environment, for which there is a public demand for information, for which there may be a hazardous risk of exposure and/or credible reports, studies or information exists that would support an HSDB record be built or updated. Collect and maintain databases for sorting and prioritizing chemicals.</p>
<p>8. Provide chemical and physical properties data for related NLM/SIS databases that link to HSDB such as ChemIDplus. These properties may include: boiling point, melting point, solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient, and other chemical/physical properties as specified by the project officer.</p>
<p>9. Provide information that aids in improving approaches to estimate chemical exposure. This may include identifying routes of exposure, identifying specific use, linking specific products and general use categories.</p>
<p>10. Identify and provide information for alternative chemicals to consider in the interest of safety for specific uses such as information from the EPA Design for the Environment (DfE) alternatives assessments.</p>
<p>11. Provide data and information for special projects related to the tasks and information described in Tasks 1-10. Meaning, similar activities may be performed outside of the usual record building schedule. This task may be in support of special enhancements to HSDB to improve the currentness of the data and/or expand content or impact on existing or new user groups.</p>

<DESC>U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution<br />Justification for modifying a contract without full and open competition<br />Contract for neutral services with Meridian Institute
<p>The following document is prepared in accordance with FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:</p>
<p>Udall Foundation <br />U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution<br />130 S. Scott Ave.<br />Tucson, AZ 85701</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of action being approved:</p>
<p>The purpose of this sole source justification is to justify and document the procurement of neutral services from Meridian Institute (Meridian) in a modification to their existing contract (1923) for facilitation of the Mid-Atlantic regional coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP) workshop.</p>
<p><br />3. A description of supplies of services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>The services include follow-up work for the Mid-Atlantic CMSP workshop, including drafting and finalizing a workshop summary report, planning and facilitating three follow-up meetings following the workshop, and distributing all workshop materials electronically. The total cost for this contract modification is $15,780.</p>
<p><br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>Other than full and open competition is authorized by FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) because there is "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>A mediation/facilitation team with firsthand knowledge of the Mid-Atlantic workshop process, participants, and outcomes was required for this additional contract work. The Meridian Institute is uniquely qualified to provide the services needed based on the following:</p>
<p>1. The Meridian team has already been contracted to prepare for and facilitate the Mid-Atlantic workshop. It is most cost effective to have them also conduct the follow-up work since they are intimately familiar with the process and participants. They are uniquely qualified with firsthand knowledge to conduct the necessary follow-up activities.</p>
<p>2. The Meridian team, Laura Cantral and Ingrid Irogyen, are uniquely qualified for this work given their extensive experience working on CMSP issues in this region.</p>
<p>3. They have already designed and executed the Northeast CMSP workshop and performed very highly in completing this work on time and within budget.</p>
<p>4. Because of these points listed above, Meridian will require little to no startup costs to continue working on the Mid-Atlantic workshop, whereas a new Contractor would incur additional costs and the work would be poorly divided.</p>
<p>6. A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required in Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:</p>
<p>This notice is being issued in accordance with FAR 5.201 and FAR 6.305 (a) and (d)</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>Meridian's rates negotiated under the GSA MOBIS schedule for qualified staff are $231/hr for a Mediator/Facilitator 4 (Senior), and $121 for a Mediator/Facilitator 2 (Associate). These rates are used in the proposed contract modification with the Meridian Institute. The U.S. Institute has data on the rates charged by the Roster qualified senior facilitators in the Mid-Atlantic. Those rates range from $185 per hour to $285 per hour. The project budget proposed by Meridian results in an hourly rate in the middle of this range for the senior facilitator assigned and an hourly rate for less experienced personnel comparable to rates charged by other Roster members with similar experience.</p>
<p>Meridian's total budget estimate was reasonably comparable to the independently developed government budget for the project, based on U.S. Institute experience with comparable work. Based on these factors, the cost to the Government is fair and reasonable for the services required by the agency.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted (Sec. 7.101) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:<br />Market research of 35 practitioners was assessed for this project.

X	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source
(unique features, function of the item, etc.). Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Honeywell installed the new building automation system (BAS) in 2009-2010  as an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 project. via contract awarded after a full and open
competitive process in 2009. As the BAS system is a Honeywell designed and constructed system, the functional operation, components and equipment and the monitoring capabilities are unique to Honeywell. Only Honeywell can maintain the system to operate as currently designed and constructed without making changes to it's design or functional performance.
There are limits on performance of other potential maintenance agreement providers related to proprietary data and equipment. Acquisition of direct  replacements parts/components for the existing equipment are obtainable only from Honeywell, the sole-source for all of their proprietary technology. The required services must provide 100% service maintenance of the existing systems, full repair and maintenance, and expert staff training to support the presently installed/performing system. No other source is practical under the circumstances. Honeywell Business Solutions is the only source that is capable of providing the supplies and services required at the level of quality required because the supplies, services, and final configuration are unique to Honeywell Business Solutions.
(5)	DESCRIBE  WHY  YOU  BELIEVE  THE  ORDER  REPRESENTS  THE  BEST  VALUE  CONSISTENT  WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:
Market research has shown that the offered pricing for maintenance contracts is competitive and the price agreed is the pricing from the contractor's FSS contract GS-21F-0134W, determined fair and reasonable by the GSA Contracting Officer at the time of award. Technical capability and Price represent the best value available to the Government.
(6)	DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
 
Pursuant to FAR Part 10  market research was conducted to find the equivalent services on
\GSA advantage E/Buy and as a result of that research the items were available on the GSA/FSS schedule. Further research through email, phone calls revealed that Honeywell International was the manufacturer and that Honeywell Building Solutions is the only provider. Market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10 was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.
(7)	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
Honeywell Business Solutions is responsible for the design, installation, and commissioning of the current system for which maintenance is required.
(8)	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVER COME ANY  BARRIERS  THAT LED  TO  THE  RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE 
ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
This need will dissolve once SLVHCS has occupied  it's new hospital  in 2016, currently under construction.. Until then, SLVHCS will have to evaluate the necessity and means of maintaining each year until we leave the facilities.
(9)	REOUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
