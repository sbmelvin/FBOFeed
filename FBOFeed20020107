<DESC>NA POC Ronald Schunk, 916-557-7480 DESC: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District intends to award on a sole source basis an out-of-scope modification to an existing construction contract, DACA05-01-C-0019 to URS Group Inc., for upgrade of a contract-containing electrical substation transformer and related system at Hill AFB, UT. Estimated Price Range for this modification is $100,000 to $250,000.00. Under this existing contract, a new sub-station and distribution system is being installed. The Air Force has determined that additional electrical capacity is required from this electrical system. Proposed sole source action will effect an increase in the electrical capacity of the contract-containing electrical transformer by approximately 67%. All related electrical components and the distribution system will be upgraded accordingly. This contract adjustment will be a one-time action with a performance period commensurate with the existing construction contract duration. It is impractical to award to another firm as the current contractor is the only source having control over the order of the contract-containing transformer and related components and distribution system. In addition, it is not realistic to consider having more than one firm procure and install a single transformer. A single transformer is required due to available space restrictions. See Note 22(See Commerce Business Daily, Monday edition). POC is Michael Shupp at 916-557-7733,email address: mshupp@spk.usace.army.mil Project Manager is John Harris at 916-557-6955.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This notice is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for:  (1) a 100-gram quantity of nano gellant material to support experimental propellant test and evaluation studies per the specifications below and (2) one set of documentation: GELLANT: The gellant shall be used in traditional earth storable fuels (jet fuels, kerosene based fuels) as well as rocket propellants (propane, methane, RP-1, etc.).  The addition of the gellant to the fuel must allow for effective and uniform mixing with the liquid fuel and the stable formation of a gelled liquid, with minimal agglomeration or separation of the gellant materials in the gelled liquid fuel.   The gellant shall allow an increase in fuel viscosity such that metal particles can be suspended in the gelled liquid fuel.  The increase in viscosity should be sufficient to allow a stable fuel with no settling of the particles in the gelled liquid.   Gellant material shall be effective for gelling both cryogenic and earth storable propellants using less than or equal to 10 weight percent (wt %) concentration of gellant in the final gelled fuel.  DOCUMENTATION: The Contractor shall have the ability to test the efficacy of the gellant material in a fuel and gellant mixture, creating a sample of a gelled fuel.  With your offer provide evidence of creating the gelled fuel with the new gellant. This can be in the form of a written report with photographs of the gelled fuel.  Rheological data, such as viscosity measurements as a function of shear rate, etc., shall be provided in the report.  Past experience with gelling liquid propane fuels with nanometer sized gellants must be demonstrated. The gellant energy value of 10,000 kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg) shall be verified by the Contractor providing a detailed theoretical calculation and/or an experimental energy measurement. The document shall be provided with delivery of the gellant. (The gellant material is a nanometer sized structure that has a high combustion energy and a high surface area.)  Data on the size of the material shall be provided in the form of either transmission electron microcoscopy (TEM) photographs, or other nanometer sized appropriate imaging or measurement technique.  The gellant material shall also have a combustion enthalpy of greater than 10,000 kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg), a surface area greater than 300 square meters per gram (m2/g) and consist of or be prepared from readily available commercial materials using proven procedures.   Although for this procurement, laboratory-scale preparation methods are acceptable for the supply of this gellant quantity. However, the Contractor shall have the procedures and technology in place such that they are capable of potentially supplying 5 lb and larger quantities of gellant material for possible future investigations or be clearly scalable to this higher production capacities. The Contractor shall furnish with their offer proof of this requirement in order to be eligible for an award.   The Contractor shall have suitable gellant analysis procedures and characterization methods to assure that the supply of the gellant material is of uniform and consistent quality and performance and shall provide proof of these with their offer.    The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 97-27. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 325199 and 1,000 employees, respectively.  The quoter shall state in their quotation their size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a qu

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center-Columbus is pursuing a 10-year, firm fixed price (FFP) with economic price adjustment (EPA), indefinite quantity (IQ) type contract under the Fleet Automotive Support Initiative (FASI) for the CONUS East and West regions.  The contract will have a two-year base period followed by one two-year option and two three-year options.  The primary goal of the FASI is to improve customer support at the user level through use of the Virtual Prime Vendor (VPV) concept.  The Vendor(s) will be required to support the identified vehicles at military installations within the region.  DSCC has coordinated with the customer to identify specific vehicles or items for which a FASI prime vendor can provide parts support, technical support, fleet requirements forecasting, inventory management, or other enhanced supply services as required by the customer.  The VPV should be capable of providing integrated logistics support for automotive/vehicle parts within a particular region.  The VPV must be capable of achieving a 98% on-demand issue rate, have the ability to forecast the customer's future needs and develop inventories or business relationships to meet such needs.  The VPV must be capable of providing value added anticipatory services such as, technical support, local Customer Service Representatives, and meet surge and sustainment requirements during mobilization.
A lead military installation will be identified as the initial site for each region.  Contract award for the region will be based on the evaluation of Vendors' proposals for the initial site's requirements.  Following contract award, and once the initial site is implemented through a three party agreement (DSCC, military customer and vendor), FASI will rollout to other customers within each of the regions.  Since FASI is intended to have one Prime Vendor/3PL cover an entire region, each of these roll out sites will be added to the contract without re-solicitation.  Sites are intended to encompass any DoD activity, including the Reserves and National Guard.
A "Market Basket" population of 450 items has been identified for the two implementation sites within the East and West regions.  This population will be included in the solicitation.  The list of 450 items will be available on the DSCC website (www.dscc.dla.mil) or (http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp) on or before 11 Jan 02.  Currently, the potential population of items for the East and West regions consists of approximately 11,000 items.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is conduct Phase I malaria vaccine trials in health adult volunteers to determine the best compromise between dose, immune response and frequency of adverse events prior to testing combinations in Phase I and Phase II studies in malaria endemic areas.

The Malaria Vaccine Development Unit (MVDU), NIAID, has a mandate to develop the process for manufacture of clinical grade material of promising malaria vaccine candidate antigens; to produce clinical grade prototype malaria vaccines through collaborations or contract manufacture; to undertake Phase I safety and immunogenicity trials in the USA and undertake Phase I and Phase II studies in populations endemic for malaria. The MVDU program has resulted in six antigens that either have or are likely in the near future to be prepared as clinical grade antigens suitable for Phase I trials. Several other antigens are at an earlier stage of development and some of these are likely to become available during the contract period. Depending on the results on Phase I trials of individual antigen and adjuvant combinations, it is expected that these antigens will progress to field testing as three combination vaccines, a mixture of four Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens, a mixture of two P. falciparum sexual stage antigens and a mixture of the same two P. falciparum sexual stage antigens with two P. vivax sexual stage antigens. These combinations must be tested in Phase I studies in the USA before they can be taken to an endemic area.
	
Mandatory Facilities Criteria: The Offeror shall demonstrate that their facility where vaccines will be formulated and volunteers vaccinated is approximately one hour travel, and no more than 2 hours under heavy traffic conditions from the MVDU unit at Rockville MD. This requirement is primarily to allow, if necessary, vaccines prepared as "point of injection formulations" either at the MVDU facility or at the contractor's facility to undergo QC procedures at MVDU after formulation and prior to injection, while still meeting a 4 hour limit on the time from formulation to injection. This travel limit is secondarily to facilitate regular meetings of the Project Officer and other NIAID with the Offerer. The Government scientists must also have ready access to examine the volunteers and to receive labile clinical specimens obtained from these volunteers.

It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded with incremental funding over a period of seven (7) years. 

RFP-NIH-NIAID-DIR-03-03 will be available electronically on or about January 22, 2002, and may be accessed through the Internet on the Contract Management Branch Homepage, located at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/.

Please note that the RFP for this acquisition has been revised to include only the Work Statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements and mandatory qualification, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.

Responses to this RFP will be due by 4:00 pm on Monday, April 22, 2002. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the Department of Energy (DOE) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to enable the DOE to obtain assistance from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) in support of the Department's efforts to improve the operational safety and cleanup activities of its nuclear facilities.   The DOE intends to award a five-year follow-on contract to the INPO.  The contract will include a twelve-month base period and four twelve-month option periods. The INPO possesses unique experience and expertise derived from their close working relationship with all U.S. utilities in the areas of operations, maintenance, radiation preparedness, technical support, engineering, training, and emergency preparedness.

The INPO is the only known organization to provide the services required by the Department to all commercial nuclear reactor firms and owns all rights to their proprietary documents and software. It is deemed appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Department. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to submit capability statements, limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received within 30 days of publication of this Notice to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Headquarters Procurement Services (ME-642), 1000 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20585.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SY Technology, Inc., of Huntsville, Alabama for development, deployment, operation and sustainment of the Site Activation Command (SAC) Coordination Center (SAC-CC) in support of the Site Activation Command, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)-Joint Program Office (JPO), Huntsville, AL.  The proposed acquisition is directed to SY Technology, Inc., pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FA R 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The selection of SY Technology, Inc., Inc. is based on the prior work performed by SY Technology, Inc., including requirements identification and preliminary design, and software development.  SY Technology, Inc, has developed an ext ensive knowledge base through a steep learning curve, and extensive interactions with the SAC.  Any source other than SY Technology would result in substantial increase in schedule risk as well as duplication of cost to the Government that cannot be recove red through competition.  It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's compressed activation schedule requirements and not disrupt current operations.  A Cost  Plus Fixed Fee, Award Term, Level of Effort type contract is contemplated.  The period of performance will consist of a five-year base period plus five (5) one-year Award Term years. The services required to meet the needs of the GMD-JPO include the continuation of the design activities which will proceed into software coding, integration and system test activities adhering to both system engineering and security requirements as direct ed by the government.  The contractor will complete the development of, and field, the site activation coordination center.  The contractor will establish a design lab to serve as a development environment to support future software releases and to provide  technical support to resolve field problems.  Development activities will include systems engineering, configuration management, security engineering, test and evaluation, certification and accreditation.   The Contractor shall travel as required to attend meetings, provide on-site support, and/or to interface with others to provide the above stated services.   The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 54171 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  This action is not open to allied participation.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained i n Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commer cial item within fifteen (15) days of this notice.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interes t and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five (45) days after publication of this syn opsis will be considered by the Government.  Interested parties are advised that the SAC-CC system is currently undergoing development and that system documentation is not currently available.  In order to be considered responsive, the capability statement  must demonstrate (1) a history of proven experience in developing, operating, maintaining, and modifying a government acquisition command and control system; (2) the ability to immediately assume the on-going project without disruption to current operatio ns, and (3) have a high probability of meeting the Government's compressed activation schedule.

<DESC>Environmental remediation services for a fixed price, IDIQ Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC) involving remedial actions at environmentally contaminated sites at various locations in CA, AZ, NV, and NM.  The Government expects most of the work to be performed in Northern California.  This procurement is reserved for competition in the Section 8(a) program pursuant to the Small Business Act.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services.  Responding 8(a) firms must have NAICS Code 562910 among their approved codes.  EFD Southwest intends to award two or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity 8(A) contracts.  The Government reserves the right to award only one contract as a result of this solicitation if at least two (2) qualifying proposals are not received.  Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business 8(a) firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $20,000,000.  The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards.  Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).  Most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in Northern California.  Typical work that may be performed under the resulting contract(s) include environmental remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, Factor 3 - Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include proposed Task Order 0001), and Factor 4 - Emergency Response Mobilization Plan are of equal importance to each other.

Encl. 	(a) SNPS Functional Requirements Document dtd 21 Dec 2001- rev. 04 Jan 02
1.  NAVAIRSYSCOM, AIR-3.0, Technical Data respectfully requests your participation in an informal review of Enclosure (a).

2. Scope. To provide an open forum, through which Industry and DOD Services may provide general comments and recommendation to the SNPS Draft FRD, which lists a set of functional attributes that should and/or may be present in an electronic technical manual standard presentation system. Your participation is very much appreciated and valued as this needed standard system and its specific requirements are formalized. 

3. Background. Acquisition Reform has led weapon system managers to utilize different and often unique Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) and their accompanying unique IETM presentation system. While individual presentation systems may optimize the return to a specific program, these solutions are burdening the overall Fleet user environment with additional training and equipment requirements.  A recent NAVAIR, 3.0 review of the differing IETM presentation systems has resulted in tasking to establish the requirements for a standard presentation system across Naval Aviation. 

4.  SNPS Goal. The overall interoperability goal is the ability to view all IETM data via a standard, web-enabled IETM presentation system.  The DOD requires that all information systems comply with the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII), Common Operating Environment (COE). Additionally, the Navy is transitioning to the Navy/ Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and the Fleet web portal as defined in Task Force Web (TFW).  The standard presentation system procured in this acquisition must successfully interface in this environment.

5. Cost analysis, pricing information, or proprietary technological information will NOT be accepted by the Government as part of this informal review.  All comments received will be made available to the public and considered for possible incorporation in any resultant request for proposal (RFP). 

6. Please submit one copy of your written response, on or before 17 January 2002 to Commanding Officer, NAVAIR, Code: AIR 251612, Attn: Ms. Jessica Nelson, Bldg. 515, 47227 Whalen Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670. E-mail: NelsonJL@navair.navy.mil.  Electronic responses will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- Nanosciences Workshop
<DESC>Berkeley Lab announces a workshop to explore the future of nanoscience research and the planning of the its Molecular Foundry.  It will be held in Berkeley on April 4 and 5, 2002.

The Molecular Foundry is a Department of Energy user facility at Berkeley Lab.   Its underlying premise is that nanoscience research is advancing beyond the synthesis and characterization of nanostructured "building blocks", to the primary challenge of the next decade: the construction of complex functional assemblies of these building blocks.  Further, the field is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary, involving both "soft" and "hard" nanostructured materials.  As a result, individual laboratories will have difficulty maintaining state-of-the-art expertise and instrumentation in all areas required for pursuit of their research interests.   

The Molecular Foundry is designed to address these issues.  The unique breadth of its facilities, from nanofabrication to nanotube synthesis to mammalian cell growth will be available to researchers from the university, industry and government laboratory community who are expert in one or more areas, but not in others. Each fully equipped facility will be maintained by a full-time dedicated staff, which will be available to assist users or collaborate with them. 

The first workshop session will be dedicated to plenary talks by internationally recognized leaders in the field exploring the challenges we face in the construction of multi-component functional structures and devices.  

The second session will be dedicated to small group meetings in which attendees will discuss their views of how the Foundry facilities can be designed and operated to be of greatest value to them as a community of users.  This will be an especially important session because the Department of Energy has provided, in the FY 2002 budget, substantial funding to begin the design of the Foundry.

The program will also include tours of the Advanced Light Source, the National Center for Electron Microscopy and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the three existing Berkeley Lab national user facilities that will be intimately linked, through facilitated user access, to the Foundry. 

Web site (foundry.lbl.gov) will provide more detailed information on the workshop.
