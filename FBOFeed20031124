<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the spot coating of exterior damaged areas of the Upper and Lower Nevada Penstocks and Upper and Lower Arizona Penstocks of Hoover Dam.  Each penstock consists of segments of pipe with nominal dimensions of 30-foot diameter, 25-foot diameter, and 13-foot diameter.  Each penstock has four smaller laterals (13-foot diameter) that direct water to the respective generator.  Coating applicators must be qualified personnel with SSPC QP-2 certification. The principal features of the work to be performed consist of  a movable and adjustable scaffolding system to allow full access to the surfaces of the penstocks and laterals, installation of temporary lighting, surface preparation and application of coating materials to repair isolated damaged areas of the penstocks and laterals, pinned connections of each pipe segment, and steel support rings and collars, waste characterization of old coating materials removed as part of the surface preparation, use of special equipment and impervious materials for temporary containment and collection of hazardous waste materials, and containment, collection, and disposal of hazardous waste.  Hazardous materials may include water from hydro-blasting, blast media (sand or metal slag), waste paint debris, chemical strippers, and/or solvents. It is strongly recommended that all prospective offerors make a site visit to examine the location of the work.  Access to the work site is very limited and conditions at the site will affect the Contractor's operations.  Site visits will be limited to the exterior of the penstock, work staging areas, and viewing potential entry points into the penstock tunnels.  A formal site visit is tentatively scheduled for December 22, 2003.  The firm date will be included in the RFP. This requirement is being procured in accordance with Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation under full and open competition.  The contract will be for a base requirement with three (3) option requirements that will be exercised over the succeeding three (3) years. It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about December 08, 2003, however all dates in this announcement are subject to change.  The RFP will be issued via www.fedbizopps.gov/ but the Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD-ROM if the website becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register on the website to be included on the offerors list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the web site after December 08, 2003 in order to access the solicitation and any subsequent amendments and/or notices.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) 112kJ/sec., 40kV, non-instrumented power supply system. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the power supply system from General Atomics Energy Products on a sole source basis. The power supply charges a repetitively discharged pulsed plasma thruster to a specified voltage within a specified period of time.  The unit is operated remotely through a fiber optic remote interface.  The power supply is designed for limited duty cycle charging to 40kV in 90msec, operating at 10Hz for an on period of two minutes maximum with a minimum off period of one hour.  The power supply is composed of seven units connected together to form a single power supply, in a single Hoffman cabinet.  These power supplies have dual, parallel output connectors so that parallel supplies can be configured in a daisy chain configuration.   The reasons supporting the JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION are as follows: 1.	      The primary justification is related to compatibility.  This purchase is intended to upgrade and augment an existing system.  We presently possess three units (which were acquired from General Atomics, Energy Products).  As described above, the General Atomics power supplies can be daisy chained together to increase the total output power.  To accomplish this, the individual power supplies must communicate with one another to balance their loading.	The General Atomics units use a commercial proprietary interface to accomplish this communication, so power supplies obtained from another source will be incompatible with our existing investment, thus limiting our testing capabilities. 2.   Failure of the power supply (due to incompatibility) with our existing equipment could result in the explosive release of up to 50 kJ of capacitively stored energy.  This could cause significant damage to costly test equipment that will be co-located with the power supply. 3.    General Atomics Energy Products is the manufacturer of the capacitors to be used in the experiment.  The power supply described above is specifically designed to charge those capacitors.  The supplies use quasi-resonant circuitry to ramp the charge current; the details of the circuitry are specific to our capacitive load.	 1.0	   PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The power supply charges a specified load in the application, to a specified voltage within a specified period of time.  The unit is operated remotely through a fiber optic remote interface.  These power supplies are part of a system profiled on Proposal No.: 12-0330.  These power supplies are designed for limited duty cycle charging to 40kV in 90msec, operating at 10Hz for an on period of two minutes maximum with a minimum off period of one hour.  These power supplies have dual, parallel output connectors so that parallel supplies can be configured in a daisy chain configuration.  The approximate size of this power supply is a standard 19 rack mount, 8.75 (5U) tall and approximately 20 deep. 2.0   ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS 2.1	Primary Input Power.  The power supply is specified to operate from one level of input voltage.  The ac input voltage shall be 480VAC, +10%, -10%, three phase, 50/60Hz.  The average input current per phase is 26A/phase.  This power supply has no circuit breaker.  This shall be a five-wire WYE input consisting of the three phase inputs, neutral and safety ground.  2.2       Input Leakage Current.  The AC leakage current shall be 5mA.  2.3	 Efficiency.  The power supply shall have an efficiency of 90%.  2.4	  Primary Input Power Surge Current.  The peak in rush input current shall be less than the peak operating input current of the power supply. 2.5 Maximum Output Voltage.  The maximum output voltage shall be 40kV.  2.6 Output Voltage Regulation.  The output voltage regulation shall be 0.5% of the maximum output voltage.   2.7	Output Power. The specification for output power of the power supply is 16kJ/sec average power at the full-specified input voltage.  The application charge time is 90 milli seconds @ 10Hz with a limited Duty Cycle as described above. 2.8	Remote Output Voltage Programming.  The desired output voltage shall be set by the voltage signal provided to the fiber optic remote programming input. 2.9     Output Voltage Polarity.	The output voltage polarity shall be positive.  The center conductor of the high voltage output cable positive with reference to the shield of the high voltage output cable.  The shield shall be connected to the chassis of the power supply.  2.10	   Output Short-Circuit Protection.  The power supply shall have internal protection to detect a load short-circuit condition.  Once detected, the charging cycle is terminated.  To restore charging, the high voltage must be turned OFF and then turned ON via the Enable input signal on the fiber optic remote control.	2.11 External Safety Interlock.  The power supply shall have an external safety interlock input signal located on the rear panel.  This signal shall break the internal +24VDC 15% which is used to power all internal logic and control circuitry.  The powered side of this interface is protected by a positive temperature co-efficient (PTC) resistor so that the connections are self-protected against short circuit connections to the chassis.  An open circuit between these two inputs disables the power supply by removing all low voltage power from internal logic and control circuitry.  The power supply is enabled by connecting these inputs together with a voltage free contact closure capable of conducting 50mA.  External safety interlock inputs from multiple power supplies cannot be connected together.  Each power supply requires a separate voltage free contact closure. 2.12     Fiber-Optic Remote Controls.  The power supply shall have the following fiber-optic remote controls and monitoring functions.  These functions are available through fiber connectors located on the rear panel.  The fiber-optic interface signals are: a.	  Serial clock input signal. b.   Serial data input signal. c.	Sync input signal. d.	Inhibit input signal. e.	  Enable input signal. f. Interlock indicator output signal. g.   Load fault indicator output signal. h.  Over-temperature indicator output signal. 2.13  Front Panel Status Indicators.  The power supply shall have the following front panel status indicator lamps for monitoring the power supply status.  The status indicator lamps are: 1)        Interlock 2)    Over Voltage 3) Over Current 4) Over Temp 5)    Internal Fault 3.0      ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS 3.1        Storage Temperature.  The storage temperature range shall be from -30ac to +85ac.  3.2  Operating Temperature.	The operating temperature range shall be from 0ac to 45ac.  3.3 Relative Humidity.  The operating relative humidity shall be from 10% to 90% non-condensing.  3.4	   Weight.  The weight of the unit shall be approximately 70lbs. 4.0	ELECTRICAL STANDARDS 4.1        Electrical Standards.  The power supplies will be designed to meet the requirements of  IEC 61010, NFPA 79, IEC 60950, and IEC 60204-1 using UL approved parts.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Janet Appleton, at janet.appleton@msfc.nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 12/9/2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

Instructors should be prepared in advance of each course offering, arrive in sufficient time prior to course delivery to be sure that materials, classroom, and software preparations are complete; have course materials in their possession, and have reviewed the course materials and examples.

Software Installation:  It will be the responsibility of the vendor to work with DTMSI and DTNM to ensure that classrooms are equipped and fully functional, with software properly installed and fully tested, prior to the start of class.  Software should be tested by the vendor on the training room PCs prior to the start of the session.  Any necessary classroom software materials and installation instructions must be received by BLS at least five working days prior to the start of a session.  

PERFORMANCE AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE:

Approximately ten working days prior to a scheduled session start date, the BLS will
notify the vendor of the number of students expected to attend the session.

Five working days prior to a scheduled start date, the BLS will notify the vendor of the
number of Federal employee students and the number of BLS contract employee
students who will attend.  At that time, the payment amount is fixed.  If the number of 
students increases AND the course is priced on a per-student basis, vendor will receive
payment for the additional students.  The vendor will make every effort to supply the 
necessary materials for the additional students by the session start date or will notify 
the BLS of its inability to do so.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

The BLS may evaluate the proposals and award the contract without any
discussions with the Offerors.  Discussions may be conducted with the Offerors to
enhance their proposal for potential award.  The selection of a vendor to provide services
will be based on our judgment of the best quality and value to the Government.
Proposals will be evaluated as follows:  

•	Quality of Past Performance for similar Training – Provide two references with contact name and telephone number. 
•	Proposed Quality of Training
•	Key Personnel and Qualifications
•	General Approach to Training
•	Price - The proposed price between substantially equal Offerors shall be a factor in the selection of an offer for Award.  The Government reserves the right to make an Award to an Offeror, other than the low Offeror, if the Government’s evaluation renders an Offeror to be significantly superior from a technical standpoint to warrant payment by the Government for a premium.  

Price the courses on a per-student basis.   Additionally, price each course above separately. 

CONTRACT AWARD:

The BLS anticipates that there will be adequate competition such that competition shall establish price reasonableness.  The BLS shall select the Offeror whose Proposal is determined to be the Best Value and consistent with the evaluation criteria above and in the best interests of the BLS.  While the non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price, as Proposals are determined to be more equal in technical merit, price becomes more important and may become the determining factor for Award.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting quotations.  All quotes received within fifteen (8) days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the quotation and reasonably available to the purchasing activity.  All Quotes shall be submitted to Bureau of Labor Statistics, Room 1830, 2 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC  20212 no later 3:00 p.m. EDT, December 5, 2003, and be clearly marked with RFQ # BLS-04-03.

Offerors may download the RFQ by accessing the FedBizopps (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Fax proposals are encouraged and must state name, address and solicitation number.  An original copy of the proposal shall follow by mail.  Quotations may also be submitted electronically if all the necessary documentation requested in this RFQ is included.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations (DOE/ORO) intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Mellon Consulting, Inc. (formerly Buck Consultants, Inc.), under FAR Part 6.303-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Sources Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Simplified Acquisitions Procedures under FAR Part 13 will be used.  The U. S. Department of Energy currently has terminated a power agreement at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) under Contract No. DE-AC05-76OR01530, ?Power Agreement?.  As part of the negotiating process following termination of the contract, all post retirement benefits associated with the Power Agreement are to be payable upon termination of contract by December 31, 2003.  Complex negotiations between the U. S. Department of Energy, the United States Enrichment Corporation and the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation are required prior to implementing final agreements related to the valuation of future postretirement benefits and assistance in evaluating the contractor?s actuarial estimation and methodologies. The contractor has previously provided expert actuarial consulting advice on contractor retirement and employee benefit programs and assisted in developing recommended courses of action under a separate contract.  The service is highly technical and complex due to IRS and ERISA regulations and contract language which involves the gamut of benefit plan changes and methods to assure cost effective and fair treatment.  This purchase order is necessary to ensure that negotiations currently underway are completed in a timely manner. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firm?s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale why you should be considered, as described above.  All interested firms must do so by 4:00 Eastern Standard Time, December 10, 2003, to Kay D. Brown, AD-424, U. S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830.  Fax No. (865)241-2549.  No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for a scanner with cradle and battery.  Symbol Technologies P/N PPT2800-ZRBZ0Y00, Microsoft PC 2002 operating system, or Equal applies. The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with fixed unit prices, with a Base Year and two (2) one-year options, for the acquisition of these scanners.  The guaranteed minimum annual quantity for the Base Year is 150 scanners. The maximum amount for the Base Year and all option years is no more than 3,000 each.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334119. The acquisition will be accomplished in two phases:  (a) offeror submission of one (1) Symbol Technologies brand name (P/N PPT2800-ZRBZ0Y00), Microsoft Pocket PC 2002, or "Equal" bid sample.  The salient characteristics are as follows: the scanner must be a CE operating system with 64 MB RAM, 1D Scan Engine, Color Display, Microsoft SDK compatible, rechargeable batteries, cradle, application programming interface (API).  The scanner must work with existing FAA developed software.  Bid samples will undergo testing and evaluation by the FAA against established specifications and standards; and (b) issuance of a Request for Offer (RFO) for submission of price proposals by offerors having successfully completed the first phase.  Offeror's bid sample will be evaluated according to published criteria contained in the FAA's Screening Information Request 1 (SIR) package.  The FAA will assess the offeror's capability to meet the FAA's requirements.  Only those offeror's whose bid sample is found to be acceptable will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the second phase of the acquisition process.  The second phase, which will be accommodated by SIR 2, involves the issuance of an RFO and submission of priced proposals.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price in accordance with the terms of the RFO.   The FAA has determined that this requirement must comply with the accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Offerors must submit a certification of compliance with the standards for consideration for this award.  All interested sources must submit requests for SIR (1) in writing (FAX No. 405-954-9219) or via the Internet.  Requests should be submitted by the attention of Maria S. Blair.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54162   Lead Measurement Project Public Notice November 24, 2003 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Resource Management Procurement Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460. Title: Lead Measurement Project  Part II: Communication and Compliance Assurance Strategy for the Real Estate Industry Response Date: December 8, 2003  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Roper ASW ("Roper") for the  second phase of a Lead Measurement Project (the "Project") to communicate to EPA management and staff the results of outreach studies conducted under Phase 1.  The first phase of this project required Roper to 1) conduct a retrospective evaluation and analysis of the EPA's past outreach efforts to  three targeted groups related to the prevention of exposure to lead; 2) develop a report setting forth the methods by which the targeted groups could be active in publicly disseminating governmental information relating to the prevention of exposure to lead; and 3) develop  a measurement process  capable of determining the effect and social implications of EPA enforcement actions relating to violations of the lead laws. The second phase of this project is key as it is the communication of the results of the awareness studies conducted under Phase 1 to EPA management and staff.  EPA source  research indicates that Roper is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because Roper is in possession of the data from Phase 1 of the Lead Measurement Project and is in the best position to present that data, summarize and report on internal and external interview results and report out on  the evaluation of new compliance assistance materials, as well as develop a list of lead compliance assistance best management practices based on integration of studies.  Based on the work they conducted during Phase 1, they are also uniquely positioned to submit compliance assistance strategy  recommendations for the real estate industry.   Notwithstanding, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements for the Project may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the Statement of Work.  Such documentation must be submitted within 10 days  of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to undertake competitive  procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS Code is 54162.  The anticipated award date is December 8, 2003. Interested parties should submit a request to Maureen Power using one  (1) one of the following methods: Facsimile: (202) 565-2554 or email: power.maureen@epa.gov referencing PR-DC-04-00389.  No telephone requests will be honored.   The point of contact for this announcement is Maureen Power at power.maureen@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with the University of Louisville, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Louisville KY to analyze urinary PAH metabolites from populations exposed to PM 2.5 in support of the Human Exposure and Atmospheric Sciences Division (HEASD) of Research Triangle Park, NC. EPA is conducting studies to apportion human exposure to sources of PM2.5 mass and to sources of toxic components of PM2.5.  As part of HEASD's research program, cooperative human exposure assessment studies of  PM2.5 to normal and susceptible populations in the Seattle area are being conducted by the University of Washington.  HEASD is collaborating with these investigators to analyze the urinary PAH metabolites from these studies. The University of Louisville laboratory has the largest collection of  authentic standards for the PAH metabolites in the United States (US) including the metabolites required for this study. This is the only known US laboratory, other than the CDC government laboratory, that has demonstrated, through scientific publications, that they have developed human urinary  metabolite assays for the wide range of PAH metabolites.  This is the only US laboratory known to have authentic standards for the benzo(ghi)pyrelene metabolites required in the Statement of Work.  This laboratory has extensive experience in the analysis of human urine for PAH metabolites and has  developed a highly sensitive and comprehensive method for a wide range of metabolites needed to perform the tasks identified in the Statement of Work.   Objective: The purpose of this project is to complete the analysis of 300 urine samples for PAH metabolites that have been collected from a series  of PM2.5 human exposure assessment studies supported by the US EPA.  Scope of Work: Under this project, the Contractor shall analyze 300 urine samples, provided by EPA (a coded 10 ml aliquot of urine will be provided for each sample to be analyzed).  The analysis shall include the determination for  each of the specified metabolites for the listed PAH (see list in SOW) and creatinine. The contractor shall provide a detailed report with specific analytical methods used (Standard Operating Protocol), the QA/QC performance data for each sample, and the data reported in both electronic (e.g.,  Excel spread sheet) and paper report format.  All data shall be reported in both in ng of metabolite per volume of urine and ng of metabolite per mg of creatinine. The analytical  method employed shall be sufficiently sensitive to detect 0.5 ng metabolite/ml of urine which is approximately  equivalent to 2 ng metabolite/mg creatinine of each PAH metabolite. At a minimum the analysis shall be conducted in duplicate and where the results vary by more than 10%, a triplicate analysis shall be conducted. PEFORMANCE PERIOD: One year from award date.  The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a small business size standard of $6.0 million, is applicable.   All interested parties who believe that they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of this announcement.  No  Solicitation is available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional sources exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter  requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored. In addition to this notice, the Statement of Work is posted for review on EPA's web site at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. Arrow down to the REQUEST FOR QUOTATION section and click on the solicitation number. Responses must be submitted no later than  12:00 noon EST, 9 December 2003 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn: Joy Kimble, RTP-POD (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or via email to kimble.joy@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CLARIFY THE DELIVERY LOCATION FOR SUBMITTALS. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture and engineering for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a major modernization project for the existing Building 53 in accordance with General Services Administration (GSA) quality standards and requirements. Building Number 53 is located on the Denver Federal Center (DFC) at Sixth Avenue and Kipling Street in Lakewood, Colorado. Building 53 was originally constructed in 1941 as the Remington Denver Ordinance Plant .30 Caliber Shop. A small, one-story addition was added at the north end in 1985.

Interview Parameters

The following parameters for the interview process are established to ensure maximum utilization of the available time and to focus on responses to critical topics.  
	·	Because of time limitations and the need to focus on critical issues, the A/E Team’s representation may not exceed five individuals: Lead Designer (attendance mandatory), Architectural Project Manager (attendance mandatory), Associated Architect (if proposed, attendance mandatory), Mechanical Project Manager (attendance mandatory), Electrical Project Manager (attendance mandatory).
	·	The interview process is intended to evoke a response to the critical design objectives and the A/E Team’s approach to manage and deliver the project successfully.  The A/E Team’s presentation should respond to the enclosed Stage II evaluation criteria recognizing the interview time constraints.
	·	Presentation aids should be limited to a graphic presentation using boards or projected images.  The A/E Team must provide its own easels and/or projectors as required.  Supplementary handouts that expand upon information covered in the presentations are NOT allowed.  Reduced format copies of presentation material are not required but may be distributed, if desired.  Since the interview schedule is very structured, strict adherence to the time allotment is mandatory.  The setup and breakdown of presentation aids should be simple to endure the best use of the presentation time.


Interviews Issues

1.	Functional Requirements
Major renovations in occupied buildings pose a unique challenge to a design team.  In addition to meeting the Architectural, Mechanical, and Electrical requirements of the project, specific care must be taken with regards to scheduling, phasing, and security.  In addressing these topics, the team should demonstrate a thorough knowledge of major renovation projects in occupied office space, and demonstrate how it is qualified to successfully complete a project of this size and complexity.

2.	Team
To provide the best possible service to the client, the team must have the ability to work as a cohesive, efficient, communicative whole.  The team should demonstrate how it will organize the work, integrate client input, and manage the design and documentation of the renovation project in a timely and cost-effective manner.

3.	Commitment of Lead Designer
GSA’s Design Excellence Program is setting a new standard in design for public buildings.  This program can only be successful with a primary commitment of time and energy from the Lead Designer.  The A/E Team must indicate:
·	A process where the Lead Designer plays a substantive leadership role.
·	A quality control methodology for the design.
·	A primary commitment from the Lead Designer to this project.

4.	Sustainable Design
The Government has a commitment to sustainable design.  Public buildings need to be at the forefront of sensitivity to the environment and set an example for private-sector buildings.  The Team should address the issue of sustainable design as it

Offerors are urged to submit brief and concise responses, within the confines of the space allotted.  Failure to submit the completed Contractor Performance Data Sheet (along with the proposal) shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government  to evaluate. Each offeror is required to submit a list of up to five of its most recent contracts within the past three years, either completed or on-going, for the same/similar products or services. It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate the offeror's past performance based upon the information furnished by the offeror and/or other information obtained by the Contracting Officer .The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or securing any information not furnished with the offer.   The Government reserves the right to review less than all information submitted, and to only analyze sufficient information to make a reasonable determination of each offeror’s past performance rating. If insufficient information regarding the offeror’s corporate history is available, the offeror is encouraged to submit for evaluation evidence of relevant past performance on the part of the offeror’s key/principal employees, as either a prime- or sub-contractor.   Past performance is assessed by the Contracting Officer and is assigned  a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adjectival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other than the lowest priced offer as set forth in the synopsis/solicitation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541612   The response date for this procurement is extended to 12/05/2003. The following questions and answers are hereby provided for clarity and to ensure the integrity of the competitive process: (Q1.)  Is there an incumbent for this project? (A1.) No. The Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) has previously done an informal in-house survey, but has never had a Contractor work with the Diversity Workgroup before. The intention of this procurement is to gain Contractor support in designing, administering and analyzing survey results. (Q2.)  Do you need a separate cost  proposal?  If no, then does the 15-page limit on the proposal include the cost proposal also? (A2.) The cost proposal should be separate from the technical proposal and is not part of the limit. (Q3.) Is this a fixed-price contract or time and material? (A3.) This is a time and materials  procurement, with a not-to-exceed (NTE) ceiling price. Offerors shall submit a labor-hour quote with direct and indirect costs and a ceiling price. (Q4). How many employees are to be surveyed? (A4.)  There are 1,325 employees within OAR. (Q5.) Task 2 mentions travel to OAR offices outside the DC  area. Is there an estimate of the number of offices to be visited and their location? (A5.) Subject to OAR approval, the successful offeror may be required to visit select offices in Research Triangle Park, NC; Ann Arbor, MI; and Las Vegas, NV to gather information on key site-related employee  concerns.  (Q6.)  Will EPA be providing the Contractor with a list of email addresses of OAR employees? (A6.) Yes. The Diversity Workgroup will work with the Contractor in administering the survey to OAR employees. (Q7.) We are interested in submitting a proposal for RFQ-DC-04-00035. However, we  are confused by your reference to the estimated level of effort of 200 hours. Can you explain what this means? (A7.) OAR estimates that it will need approximately 200 hours of Contractor labor in assisting the Diversity Workgroup with developing, administering and analyzing survey results.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis.  Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking qualified sources for the follow-on acquisition of the Theater Deployable Communications (TDC) Modules and Kits project(formerly called TDC Integrated Communications Access Packages (ICAP)).  TDC is a state-of-the-art ground communications system designed to replace legacy communications systems in use at deployable Air Force units.  TDC provides a local and metropolitan area switched communications network for internet protocol, voice, and video data through the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) circuit switches, hubs, routers, multiplexers, satellite terminals, network management/information protection, and other equipment. The original TDC Modules and Kits contract was awarded in Oct 1996 to Motorola, with follow-on contracts awarded to General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS) and REDCOM Laboratories in Jun 2002.  With the significant amount of equipment ordered to support ongoing Air Force operations, we are approaching existing contract ceilings sooner than anticipated and are currently developing the detailed acquisition strategy to complete fielding to all remaining units. The TDC baseline is well-defined, with specific requirements found at http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil (under "Business Opportunities" select "Systems" for Type and "All" for Location, then click on "GO" - from the next screen, click on Theater Deployable Communications Modules and Kits). The scope of the total TDC Modules and Kits effort is to integrate and field modules and kits to deployable Air Force units.  This effort also includes upgrading modules/kits to maintain reasonable currency with the COTS baseline and/or provide additional capability to the users.  Although this effort does NOT include end user support, training, or system manuals, it does include coordinating with the organizations providing those services to ensure they have sufficient information on the modules/kits to provide the necessary support to our users. IMPORTANT:  We have grouped all modules/kits into five functional categories - voice, data, muxing, transmission, and network control.  Any award made as a result of this effort will be for a category of equipment, not as individual modules or kits. Interested firms are encouraged to provide a qualification package for this effort.  Qualification packages must detail your experience with BOTH integration of equipment into deployable transit cases AND your experience with/knowledge of the key components (e.g., routers, switches, muxes) of the equipment category you are interested in providing.  You should also detail any experience you have retrofitting/upgrading previously fielded systems.  Responses must include the company name, address, size/type of business (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8 (a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-connected veteran-owned small business, women-owned business, or HUBZone small business), whether U.S. or foreign owned entity, and a point of contact. Responses must identify which of the five categories your company is interested in; you may identify one or more categories for consideration.  Limit your qualification package to a maximum of 15 pages.  All responses must be received by close of business on 5 Dec 2003 and should be submitted electronically, by email, to john.sorgini@hanscom.af.mil, erik.urban@hanscom.af.mil, and joan.wandrei@hanscom.af.mil.  Attachments must be in Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format.  Responses not conforming to the above requirements will be considered NOT RESPONSIVE for purposes of this sources sought announcement.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Call Joan Wandrei (781) 377-7965 with questions regarding this notice.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for safety and mission assurance (S&MA) support services. Selected services associated with this contract are performed at various domestic locations including but not limited to:  Sonny Carter Training Facility; Houston, TX; White Sands Test Facility, NM; Palmdale and Huntington Beach, CA; and other NASA centers such as Kennedy Space Center, FL; Langley Research Center, VA.  Services under this contract also may be performed overseas at such locations as the International Space Station (ISS) Program International Partners.   This potential contract will require overall S&MA support to the Space Shuttle Program, the ISS Program, the Orbital Space Plane (OSP) Program, to all Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) developed at JSC, to both Space Shuttle and ISS-related Extravehicular Activity (EVA) hardware and operations, and to both Shuttle and ISS payloads.  The contractor must also support the development and implementation of institutional/industrial safety programs and practices for JSC personnel and facilities.  Contemplated requirements will include: compliance with existing and development of new S&MA requirements, standards, and processes; support to design and acceptance reviews for major program and project hardware and software deliverables; and review of program and project S&MA data products/deliverables such as Failure Modes and Effects Analyses/Critical Items Lists (FMEA/CIL's), safety data packages and hazard reports, noncompliance reports, waivers, deviations, and exceptions, problem reports, and acceptance data packages.	Review of these S&MA deliverables must assure that program requirements are met, that deficiencies or areas of noncompliance are identified, and that appropriate risk analyses have been conducted. The contractor will also be required to perform software assurance and have evidence of a continuous process improvement program.    The contractor must also support multiple program boards and panels, represent S&MA in the evaluation of proposed change requests, problem resolutions, hazard report and FMEA/CIL dispositions, and risk assessments.  This support includes the analyses necessary to support the certification of flight readiness prior to each launch.  The contractor will provide real-time support as required in the JSC Mission Evaluation Room (MER) by reviewing in-flight anomalies and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements and represents a safe course of action for the program(s).  The contractor will also review proposed launch commit criteria, crew procedures and flight rules to assure that hazard controls are not violated.  The contractor will also be expected to perform system hazard analyses, reliability analyses, maintainability analyses, probabilistic risk analyses, fault tree analyses, risk trades, and effectively use of other S&MA tools and techniques to aid program managers in assessing and understanding risks and risk trade-offs as they apply to programmatic design and operational decisions.	The contractor will also perform structural, thermal, dynamic, and kinematic analyses, including assessments of the probability of penetrations from micrometeoroids and orbital debris, the hazards of space radiation, and other risks to the health of crewmembers exposed to the low-Earth orbital environment.  The contractor will also be responsible for Quality Assurance functions for all major programs and projects, including Quality Engineering, Procurement Quality Assurance, Government In-line Assurance, Contract Surveillance, and Software Quality.  The contractor shall also provide support to human hazardous test activities at the JSC, and support Test Readiness Review Boards to assure that proposed test activities do not compromise subject health or safety.  The contractor will also assist the Government in exploring and developing new S&MA tools and techniques, and in evaluating the S&MA implications of new processes, devices, and technologies, such as micro- and nano- fabrication techniques.  Contractor personnel must possess extensive knowledge of Shuttle and ISS subsystems and program processes, as well as expertise in the safety, reliability, maintainability, and quality assurance and engineering disciplines.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources Sought for Medical/Surgical Items This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A formal solicitation or request for quotations may be issued at a later date.  Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/25.html#25.003.  Potential offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not be limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  If detailed literature is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel may be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products could be eliminated from further consideration.  If the detailed literature provided does not sufficiently address all of the listed criteria, the product may be eliminated from further consideration without further discussion. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141.**  Companies submitting samples are also encouraged to obtain Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts for those products from the respective government contract office.  VA has the option of awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  If VA chooses to use a BPA as the contracting method, those companies who do not have their products on an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition.  Similarly, if VA chooses to use a BPA, VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotations. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable.   NOTE: SAMPLES FOR ANY ITEM THAT INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE PRODUCT  MEETS A SPECIFIC STANDARD (e.g. AAMI, ASTM, etc.) MUST INCLUDE LITERATURE OR A LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER INDICATING HOW THE PRODUCT MEETS THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 17, 2003.  Companies not submitting samples by the above date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.  For additional information regarding contracting issues please contact John Callahan (708) 786-5855.  For additional information regarding submission of samples please contact Carl Hunter (708) 786-7783.

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement for Pressure Transducers
<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport (NUWC Division Keyport) is soliciting proposals under a broad agency announcement (BAA), N00253-BAA11-03. NUWC Division Keyport is interested in proposals that provide pressure transducers for use in the production of newly-designed back-up air data sensors for the F/A-18.  Proposals may be accepted, and awards made resulting from this announcement, through 30 Nov 04, addressed to Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Acquisition Division, 610 Dowell Street, Keyport WA 98345, Attn: Ms. Monique Klose. This is an unrestricted solicitation. The purpose of this announcement is to investigate innovative commercial technologies and approaches for pressure transducers that produce transducers that meet the following characteristics:  General:  This specification is for a strain gauge type pressure transducer.  The pressure tra nsducer will be exposed to a pressure range of 0 to 35 PSIA and a temperature range of 40 degrees C to 95 degrees C.  During operation over this temperature and pressure range the transducer will be exposed to shock levels of 750g (1 ms half sine pulse) and vibration levels of 15g from 5 Hz to 2500 Hz.  Operating Pressure range:  0 to 20 PSIA.  Dimensions:  1 inch diameter max by 1.25 inches long max exclusive of pressure fitting and cable strain relief.  Pressure fitting:  MS33656-4.  Electrical connection:  3 foot polyurethane cable.  Weight:  5 oz max excluding cable.  Output Voltage:  100mV nominal with 10V bridge stimulus.  Input current:  2.5 ma nominal at 10V bridge stimulus.  Output impedance:  1500 ohms min.  Accuracy:  The accuracy of the pressure transducer at room ambient conditions (20 degrees C) is to be greater than 0.1 percent Full Scale.  Further, given any com bination of increasing or decreasing pressure and temperature over the range of 0 to 20 PSIA and -40 to 95 degrees C, the pressure transducers output must fall within .15 percent of a central value for any repeated combination of pressure and temperature variance.  The central value must be within 2 percent (FS) of the ideal value for the pressure applied regardless of the temperature.  The maximum deviation in the central value found must be within 0.05 percent between any two adjacent temperature points that are 1.5 degrees C apart.  The maximum slew rate in a forced air environment for temperature is 5 degrees C per minute maximum.  The maximum slew rate in pressure is 100 PSI per minute.  The repeatability is to include all effects on both the output scale and zero point and must include, but is not limited to, all hysteresis effects.  The long-term stability of the pressur e transducer when exposed to the environment indicated to be 0.1 percent maximum per annum.  Under this broad agency announcement, contracts will be awarded to those contractors who are determined technically acceptable. Proposals must include the following:  Offerors are requested to provide Descriptive Literature/Commercial product brochures that are typically provided for commercial sector bidding with their quote.  Descriptive literature means information furnished by an offeror, such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures, that shows a product's characteristics or construction or explains its operation.  The term includes only that information required to evaluate the acceptability of the product and excludes other information for operating or maintaining the product.  Descriptive literature is requested to establish, for the purpose of evaluation, details of the  product offered that are specified above and pertain to significant elements, such as:  (1) Design, (2) Materials, (3) Components, (4) Performance characteristics, and (5) Methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  Descriptive literature, shall be identified to show the item(s) of the offer to which it applies.  Submit pricing information separately, with unit and extended pricing information.

The goal of the program is the development of improved detection and characterization of radiological threats; improved sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity of measurements conducted in a field environment; innovative means to identify Special Nuclear Materials (SNM); advanced technologies for verification and compliance monitoring; and portable hand held instruments with minimal battery power needs for use by non-technical personnel to support inspections in the radiological arena.

DTRA is requesting organizations (commercial, academic, non-profit, etc.) conducting research and development in the radioactive material detection and identification arena to provide information regarding their current efforts and areas of potential research.  Information should be limited to research that demonstrates quantifiable improvements in such areas as: detection stand-off; system accuracy (fewer false positives, higher detection rates); sensitivity; resolution; processing electronics; system integration; communication protocol (for data retrieval, as necessary); analysis software; decision support systems; and related criteria.  Detection systems must also satisfy operational constraints for system size, weight, volume, power, reliability, durability, maintenance, and ease of use.  Desired detection system improvements include, but are not limited to: gamma passive and active interrogation technology; neutron passive and active interrogation technologies; and alternative technologies to traditional gamma and neutron detection such as (but not limited to) x-ray fluorescence, sensor networks (statistical optimization), ionization density, etc.

This notice solicits information regarding current and potential research in the radioactive material detection and identification field that addresses the above goals and objectives.  It is expected that proffered information will aid DTRA in preparing a roadmap for future detector/system development.  Request information be submitted to Dr. Karen Hirsch via e-mail, karen.hirsch@dtra.mil no later than 15 December 2003.  Responses shall be no longer than five pages and shall be in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word format.  Inclusion of Rough Order of Magnitude estimates for the cost to complete the successive near- and longer-term R&D programs is also desired and highly encouraged.  Maturity and risk level of the supporting technologies should also be discussed.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by DTRA.  DTRA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice.
