Moisture management and breath ability
Freedom of movement  
Increased protection from desert storms (water repellency and sand storms) 
Minimal impact on combat load
Anti odor, anti bacteria, anti static

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute is seeking to establish a Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program to assist the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI in fulfilling its mission to identify more effective treatments for children with cancer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks:

A.	TASK AREA 1 - IN VIVO TESTING

In vivo testing panel:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of pre-clinical models for 6 to 8 childhood cancers, with each cancer type represented by 6-10 different xenograft lines deemed suitable for in vivo drug testing (henceforth termed the pediatric pre-clinical panel).

Stage 1 testing: The Offeror shall conduct experiments to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ten to fifteen agents (or combinations of agents) annually in the first stage of testing.  Stage 1 testing of an agent shall involve evaluating the test agent's activity at its MTD against the entire pediatric pre-clinical panel.

Stage 2 testing:  For agents for which anti-tumor activity is observed in Stage 1 testing, Stage 2 testing shall include a further evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of the agent against the selected tumor types for which activity was observed in Stage 1.  The testing to be performed in Stage 2 will vary depending upon the agent and the responsive tumor types, but may include developing a full dose response curve for the agent against the tumor types for which activity was identified in Stage 1 testing; studying the pharmacokinetics of the agent to correlate anti-tumor activity with the agent's blood levels; studying the agent in orthotopic mouse models and in models of metastatic disease; and studying the agent in relevant genetically engineered mouse models.

B.	TASK AREA 2 - IN VITRO TESTING

In vitro testing:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of in vitro models for selected childhood cancers to be used for in vitro testing of agents supplied to the Contractor.  Ten to 15 agents entering Stage 1 testing will likely undergo in vitro testing each year against the in vitro panel, and an additional 4 to 8 other agents (or combinations of agents) will likely require testing each year.

C.	TASK AREA 3 - SPECIALIZED STUDIES

Pharmacokinetic evaluations:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine systemic exposure and plasma elimination kinetics in appropriate animals using the routes of administration used for drug testing for agents progressing to Stage 2 testing for which there are not sufficient extant data describing the pharmacology of the agent in murine models.
Molecular target assessment:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine to establish whether molecularly targeted agents have achieved target inhibition/modulation under test conditions for selected tested agents.

The Government anticipates that one (1) cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of five (5) years.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The RFP will be available on or about August 20, 2003 with a due date for receipt of proposals of October 6, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through internet address: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/.   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this Solicitation and Amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFER'S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact:  Doris Rosenblatt, Contracting Officer at e-mail:  dr220a@nih.gov/ FAX: 301-402-6699; Telephone 301-435-3824.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open only to construction 8(a) firms with a bona fide Washington State office.  The Government intends for the Large 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $25,000.  The $25,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $125 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $150 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000,000 and $6,000,000.  Note, an additional 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $100,000 to $1,500,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
     Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
      The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.  The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.

<DESC>Specific Work Requirement:  The client requires dry-wood termite fumigation and glycol borate treatment inside three identically sized warehouses, constructed with cinder block and terra cotta walls, and exposed wooden ceiling, rafters, and interior floor-to-ceiling beams.  Each building measures 497 feet long by 202 feet wide.  Each building is topped with a series of three lengthwise curved-arch roofs.  Picture three loaves of bread placed side by side by side.  Each of the three arched roofs is topped by a windowed crows nest running the entire 497 foot length of the arch and measuring approximately ten feet wide and eight feet high.  The base of the roof is approximately 17 feet above floor level at 1) the exterior walls and at 2) both points 67 feet in from the exterior walls, where the three lengthwise arches join.  Height at the top of the arch is approximately 25 feet.  The crows nests were designed to allow in light and are open to the floor below.  The warehouses contain a number of wooden crates and boxes and care should be taken to minimize dripping or spray of glycol borate.  Computer workstations and forklifts will require tarp covering.  Based on the dimensions cited, the government estimates each building to contain approximately 2,500,000 cubic feet of space requiring Vikane/Chloropicrin fumigation.  The ceiling area is estimated at approximately 100,000 square feet, plus a factor of 50% to cover rafters, crows nest, floor-to-ceiling beams, and various doorways.  Therefore total glycol borate treatment area per building is estimated at 150,000 square feet.

The tasks in support of the Statement of Work (SOW) will provide methods to be responsive to evolving Agency policies and programs dealing with performance-based environmental programs, such as Performance Track.  Performance-based environmental programs are typically designed to facilitate and support voluntary partnerships with industry, governments, and other stakeholders to reach common objectives.  These partnerships are designed to help facilities, companies, institutions, and communities improve their compliance records, achieve environmental protection beyond regulatory requirements, and to attain levels of environmental performance that benefit their workers, their communities, their customers, and the environment.  Work under the SOW will be primarily for issues related to developing and operating performance-based environmental programs; working to improve the environmental performance of facilities, companies, and institutions; and identifying and reducing barriers to these improvements. Offerors are expected to have and demonstrate the following: 1) a working knowledge of various performance-based environmental programs managed by federal and state agencies, industry groups, and non-governmental organizations; 2) experience in environmental policymaking and a working knowledge of the major environmental statutes; 3) a working knowledge of various environmental databases, including those at the federal and state levels, and methods to retrieve ans consolidate the data; and 4) a working knowledge of various manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, small facilities, and local communities and stakeholders. Up to two contracts administered in accordance with FAR 16.504 are anticipated to result from the Request For Proposals (RFP).  The contracts will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type with one (1) 12-month base period and four (4) 12-month option periods for a maximum estimated total of 203,112 hours (maximum quantity per each12-month period is estimated at base period: 37,500 hours; Option Period (OP)1: 39,000 hours; OP 2: 40,560 hours; OP 3: 42,182 hours; and OP 4: 43,870 hours).  The NAICS code for this effort is 541620.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be released on or about October 21,2004.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation, SOW, amendments (if any) and other related information will be available via the Internet at www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0312299/index.htm     Prospective offerors are to monitor the Internet site for the status of this solicitation and shall download the solicitation from the Internet site since hardcopies of the solicitation will not be provided.

<DESC>Request for Information

Crime in the United States Data Driven Website

This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only!  The GPO/FBI seeks a proposal for the creation of dynamic database driven web site based on the data from Crime in the United States publication.  The goal of this web site is to allow the user to search the data and to create custom tables.  Alternative displays of data such as graphs and color-coded maps might also be helpful to the user. Each table in Crime in the United States is focused on a different type of data and each would need a custom search.  (Note: because of the way data is recorded, comparisons across tables is not possible)

Background

Crime in the United States, a publication of the FBI, Uniform Crime Reporting program, is an annual comprehensive statistical publication produced from data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States.  It is a compiles volume and rate of crime offenses for the nation, the states, and individual agencies. This report also includes arrest, clearance, and law enforcement employee data. Historically this data has been published as a printed book and recently the data has been available on the internet as PDF, HTML, and Microsoft excel format.  HTML web edition of the 2002 Crime in the United States is http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_02/html/web/index.html.

Examples

The following are websites that already have taken some crime data and created a data driven website.  

Bureau of Justice Statistics
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/

Easy Access to FBI Arrest Statistics
http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ezaucr/

Easy Access to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports
http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ezashr/


Website requirements

•	US Section 508 compliant
•	Website can be viewed across platforms not requiring a specialized plug-in
•	All pages would have a printer friendly format
•	Data can be updated from year to year by different vendors or FBI
•	Data can be exported into XML or other future friendly format
•	Search system is modular and may be updated by different vendors
•	Administrator can easily log in and change numbers when needed through a web interface

Data from previous years

HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Excel files from Crime in the United States, 2002:
http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/02cius.htm

ESIB runs the Climate Leaders program which enlists major corporations to set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and to track their progress toward their targets via a Climate Leaders reporting and GHG management protocol. A  key driver for GHG reporting is the area of corporate sustainability. SustainAbility is embarking on its third international benchmark of sustainability reporting, part of the long-standing Global Reporters series in partnership with the United Nations Environment Program, and for the first time  this year, international ratings agency Standard & Poor's.  The purpose of this requirement is to support SustainAbility's production of Global Reporters 2004, the latest version of a regular sustainability progress report they have been producing for the past three years. This report is unique in  the scope and breadth of its coverage, its engagement of major global corporations, and its track record on evaluating corporate sustainability. This will enable the Climate Leaders program to better understand the drivers and processes that are already underway in sustainability reporting and to  ensure the Climate Leaders effort is harmonized to the extent possible with these other ongoing efforts.  The NAICS code for this procurement will be 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement  as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered and given adequate evaluation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), Energy Star Labeling Branch (ESLB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Decision Analyst, Inc.  Energy Star Labeling Branch (ESLB) promotes the development, marketing, and sale of energy-efficient products through business partnerships and public outreach. Therefore, it is essential that the development of Energy Star product  specifications be mindful of market conditions and consumer behavior.  Programmable thermostats present a large opportunity of energy savings; however, EPA has found they are often under-utilized and misused due to design. Simply, they are too difficult for consumers to use regularly and  correctly. Therefore, Energy Star feels new draft specifications for programmable thermostats supports the design of ?user-friendly' products. To address this concern, we feel we need greater amounts of consumer feedback on what constitutes user-friendliness. We believe this information will help  us determine the next appropriate steps for changes to the Energy Star draft specification for programmable thermostats, which has a target launch date of November 1, 2004.  Decision Analyst is a recognized expert in both the fields of HVAC and market research using both primary and secondary  marketing research methods. Specifically, Decision Analysts will pull information from an already-written base report and then enhance that information by asking tailored questioned to a pre-selected panel of participants. Decision Analysts maintains this panel in order to provide quick turn-around  on tailored reports.  The NAICS code for this procurement will be 541620.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The use of credit scoring by commercial banks has become more prevalent during the past several years. However, there is concern that the use of credit scoring by commercial banks will exclude small businesses, especially, small businesses in central cities, rural areas, and less advantaged groups from the bank loan market.  Looking at both sides of this issue, many argue that basing loan acceptance primarily on quantitative financial information is too impersonal.  By not allowing for bankers to develop a relationship with potential small business owners through personal interaction, this approach could adversely affect the flow of capital to less advantaged groups.  

However, those who support the use of credit scoring argue that by looking primarily at financial variables, there should be less discrimination based on the “perception” and “subjective attitudes” of the loan officers.  As such, those with the same financials should warrant the same treatment in terms of loan acceptance. Moreover, by reducing the costs of credit review, thus reducing overall administrative costs of small business lending, more loans will be made. The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

Hypotheses should be developed to address topics such as the number and growth of small business firms, small business employment, business cycle performance, or finance issues dealing with credit availability and capital access, among others.  Analysis of rural small business issues should ideally investigate the differences across the states in small business performance as well as identify differences between rural and non-rural firms.  This approach would integrate an analysis of state policies that affect rural small business development as well as regional differences across the U.S.  Furthermore, the research will ideally identify the part rural small businesses play in state economic growth.  The research proposal should carefully identify data sources and methodology as well as testable hypotheses.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<SUBJECT>R -- Study  Fast Growth Companies
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-04-Q-0025

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Fast growth companies are a small percentage of all companies but are often believed to be the engine of growth. While a lot of hype associated with fast growth companies exists, there needs to be more concrete results showing their status and value in the economy.

Research is needed to determine their distribution by industry, at what age they tend to grow, is their growth internal versus acquisition, what percentage of the business population they represent, how they financed their growth, business characteristics and how they fit into our economy (or economic growth).  Equal attention needs to be on fast shrinking firms to determine if these were recent fast growers and do the fast growers essentially net out the fast shrinkers.  Considering much of the results could be based on the definition created to define fast growth, various definitions will be needed to compare how the definition affects the results (growing by an amount within a certain time frame, like doubling or reaching a certain growth level within a certain time frame). 

To conduct this research, a longitudinal database of firms over time with a size indicator(s) needed.  Researchers can procure special tabulations using the Statistics of U.S. Business program at the U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/csd/susb/susb.htm) or obtain access to another longitudinal database.  Focusing on venture capital portfolios is another possible datasource, but it is worried that this method would focus too much on the few firms that have growth from initial public offerings.  Data costs will be borne by the researcher and should be reflected in the cost of the proposal.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>Small business owners are interested in selling their products or services to the government. In many instances, small business owners are interested in stepping in and performing functions previously under the tutelage of the Federal government.  Government outsourcing is governed by at least two important documents: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-76 and Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (PL 105-270).

These sources may shed light on the impact of government outsourcing on small business.  For the period 1999-present, for example, are small businesses winning these contracts?   What types of work is being outsourced?  Is there a trend showing that the outsourced work is being bundled?  To what extent, in terms of percentage of total expenditures, has the federal government outsourced to the private sector?   The proposed research should address such issues, but the list presented here is not exhaustive.  This research should include the background information of government outsourcing, literature review of outsourcing history and data information. . NOTE:  The Solicitation document will be posted on FEDBIZOPS June 8, 2004.  No other documents will be issued.  Provide four (4) copies of your price and technical data.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award . The latter must be packaged separately.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is inviting applications from Architects or Architect/Engineer firms to provide professional services for design/construction related work at VA Facilities including Medical Centers, and Veterans Benefits Facilities nationwide including the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  These services may include, but are not limited to, capital investment proposals, pre-design services such as facility assessments, development of design programs, computer modeling simulation, schematic designs, preparation of design/build Solicitation documents, technical studies, standards and specifications, cost estimates and/or reports; design period services such as review and analysis of designs by other A/Es for compliance with national codes, scope of work, good design practices, adequacy and appropriateness of functional layout, system selection, technical solutions, sustainability, value engineering and life cycle operation considerations, technical studies, reports, cost estimates and/or suggested design solutions or modifications; construction period services such as inspections, technical studies, cost estimates and/or reports; and, post construction services such as post occupancy evaluations, technical studies and/or reports.  Projects will primarily involve medical or medically related facilities as well as office structures and will require some or all of the following disciplines: architecture, interiors, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, civil, automatic transport, environmental engineering, landscape architecture, planning, cost estimating, historic preservation, CADD, and CAFM.  Services will be directed through individual task orders and will be performed during a base with four one-year options.  The minimum order will be $5,000.  Only Architects or Architect/Engineer firms demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  This is a multiple award procurement in which six (6) large businesses and four (4) small businesses will be selected for these services.  Large Firms will be selected for nationwide contracts and small firms for regional areas contracts.  No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the VA by 3:30 PM EST November 2, 2004.   A current SF 330, representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with current 330s for each proposed consultant’s office involved.  Applications will be rated based on the relevant experience of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicant’s capacity to do the work, record of past performance on VA work, geographic consideration and the participation of minority-owned and women-owned consultants, and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.  Award of a contract is dependent upon the availability of funds.  This is not a request for a proposal.  If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the small disadvantaged business and women-owned business contracting goals will be 35% (SB), 5% (SDB), 5% (WOB), 3% (HUBZone), 7% (VOB), and 3% (SDVOSB). Note: The “covenant against contingent fee” clause is applicable to this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The regulatory compliance team will provide advance notice of its visit to th e offerors facilities.  The teams findings and recommendations to the MITS product manager shall render an offeror qualified or not qualified to execute a contract for BChE within the required time.  The offeror is solely responsible for furnishing the re gulatory compliance team the necessary information to demonstrate meeting the qualifications.  Offerors not meeting these requirements shall not receive a request for proposal.         Subcontractors may be used.  If an offerors approach includes subcontract performance, the offeror shall provide the same qualification information for the subcontractor(s ).

<DESC>Amendment Two (2) to Solicitation 263-2004-(FW)-0088  is issued to change the NAICS Code to 561990, all information remains the same.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of sources for turf maintenance and ice and snow removal services for general and selected areas. This requirement is to provide a comprehensive Turf Maintenance and, Ice and Snow Removal Program. The areas with service requirements include the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bethesda, Maryland campus and the National Institutes of Health Animal Center (NIHAC) Poolesville, Maryland campus.  The anticipated performance requirements consist of a basic period of twelve months with four, one-year consecutive option periods. 

The successful contractor shall furnish any and all the requested services by providing the necessary qualified personnel, material, equipment, tools and supplies as needed and in a timely manner to perform the requested services. 

The area for turf services at the Bethesda campus is approximately 59.45 hectares with an estimated number of 36 mowing/trimmings required per season.  Up to four complete edging of pavement areas may be required.  Up to 16 hectares may be selected for turf verifying, over-seeding and fertilization and up to 100 hectares may be selected for leaf removal. The NIHAC, Poolesville campus encompasses approximately 112.9 hectares of which approximately 40.9 hectares comprise fine lawns and approximately 72.0 hectares of fenced pasture fields. The remaining acreage is heavily wooded.  Approximately 34 fine lawn mowing and up to 4 pasture mowings will be required per season. 

The ice and snow removal services will generally consist of a comprehensive control and removal program for accumulations on the Bethesda and Poolesville campuses between November 01 and April 15 of the contract year.  This shall include (I) Pedestrian Areas (all building entrances, all nitrogen/oxygen tank areas, all flag pole access walks, all shuttle bus stops/shelters, all security entrance shelters and pedestrian turnstiles, all loading docks and steps and all playground areas and all sidewalks/bike paths); (II) Roads and Parking Lots (all road, parking lot, parking garage top decks and ramps); (III) Handicap Parking (all exposed handicap parking spaces and access isles); and (IV) NIH Animal Center (a comprehensive program of all campus pedestrian areas, roads, parking lots, service areas, steps, handicap parking and sidewalks). 


The value for these services is a strong function of prevailing weather conditions.


If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization. THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR THE SBA 8(a) PROGRAM.  ALL INTERESTED 8(a) COMPANIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT A REQUEST. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561990 with a standard size of $6 million. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. 
Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites. The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) potential technical capability to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice; 2) capacity to secure and apply the full range of human and technical resources required to successfully perform these requirements; 3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with program schedules; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and 4) potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract .
Interested firms responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.

<DESC>UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<SUBJECT>A -- PEDIATRIC PRECLINICAL TESTING PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>N01-CM-37027-23
<RESPDATE>102103
<CONTACT>Doris Rosenblatt, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-3824, Fax (301) 402-6699, Email dr220a@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute is seeking to establish a Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program to assist the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI in fulfilling its mission to identify more effective treatments for children with cancer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks:

A.	TASK AREA 1 - IN VIVO TESTING

In vivo testing panel:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of pre-clinical models for 6 to 8 childhood cancers, with each cancer type represented by 6-10 different xenograft lines deemed suitable for in vivo drug testing (henceforth termed the pediatric pre-clinical panel).

Stage 1 testing: The Offeror shall conduct experiments to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ten to fifteen agents (or combinations of agents) annually in the first stage of testing.  Stage 1 testing of an agent shall involve evaluating the test agent's activity at its MTD against the entire pediatric pre-clinical panel.

Stage 2 testing:  For agents for which anti-tumor activity is observed in Stage 1 testing, Stage 2 testing shall include a further evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of the agent against the selected tumor types for which activity was observed in Stage 1.  The testing to be performed in Stage 2 will vary depending upon the agent and the responsive tumor types, but may include developing a full dose response curve for the agent against the tumor types for which activity was identified in Stage 1 testing; studying the pharmacokinetics of the agent to correlate anti-tumor activity with the agent's blood levels; studying the agent in orthotopic mouse models and in models of metastatic disease; and studying the agent in relevant genetically engineered mouse models.

B.	TASK AREA 2 - IN VITRO TESTING

In vitro testing:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of in vitro models for selected childhood cancers to be used for in vitro testing of agents supplied to the Contractor.  Ten to 15 agents entering Stage 1 testing will likely undergo in vitro testing each year against the in vitro panel, and an additional 4 to 8 other agents (or combinations of agents) will likely require testing each year.

C.	TASK AREA 3 - SPECIALIZED STUDIES

Pharmacokinetic evaluations:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine systemic exposure and plasma elimination kinetics in appropriate animals using the routes of administration used for drug testing for agents progressing to Stage 2 testing for which there are not sufficient extant data describing the pharmacology of the agent in murine models.
Molecular target assessment:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine to establish whether molecularly targeted agents have achieved target inhibition/modulation under test conditions for selected tested agents.

The Government anticipates that one (1) cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of five (5) years.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The RFP will be available on or about August 20, 2003 with a due date for receipt of proposals of October 6, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through internet address: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/.   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this Solicitation and Amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFER'S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact:  Doris Rosenblatt, Contracting Officer at e-mail:  dr220a@nih.gov/ FAX: 301-402-6699; Telephone 301-435-3824.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $75 Million. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.    
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State. A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary. The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.

<DESC>The following information is hereby added: IMPORTANT PCO NOTICE

NOTE:

The PCO on this effort is now Michael J Wood.  Point of contact information is: (801) 586-3428, email Michael.wood@hill.af.mil


Wing Assembly Production RFI, Solicitation FA8202-04-R-AAAF is hereby extended.  Final vendor RFI responses are expected by close of business 8 October 2004.

The following are answers to questions that concern the RFI
 
1.	Are we asking the contractors to include MAB in the manufacturing of the new wings? 
 
The optimal solution would likely include MAB for final installation.  An example might be to have the wing center and outer sections arrive at Hill for the installation and FCF.  Or, maybe some control surface installations could be made at Hill, etc.  There is no detailed requirement at this point.
 
2.	Do we want MAB to manufacture parts of the wing for the contractor? 
 
No, MAB is not set up to handle production work in the context of having production processes in place for new flight structure.
 
3.	Do we want the contractor to ID requirements for ALC involvement, If necessary? 
 
The intent of the statement is to have them consider reasonable sharing of workload in order to expedite the wing replacement process with minimal availability impacts.  The requirements mentioned refer to what the contractor sees as necessary for a working arrangement to be developed between them and Ogden Air Logistic Center.  It is completely understood that some contractors could support the entire process but some aspects of the task may not be in their area of expertise nor in their best interest, or that of the Air Force.  Elements that affect this are modifications or other maintenance work impacting the fleet that could be timed with a wing change.
 


All future information on this acquisition will be posted on the link below.  Please check this link often for updates.

<DESC>This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is modified to change text within (1) Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and (2) Other UAV.  The following description is revised to include changes:  The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is currently seeking potential sources, large or small businesses, which are capable of demonstrating at a minimum Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capabilities for Sea Viking 2006, an advanced Warfighting experiment.  Respondents must demonstrate at a minimum that they can provide the following UAV capabilities: Surveillance and Reconnaissance: visual imagery capable of detecting/identifying/locating (better than 100M accuracy) tactical elements of threat forces day or night with modular payloads; Range: 150NM; Endurance:  6-8 hours; Launch/Recovery: Able to launch and recover by MEU forces operating ashore; Responsiveness: Able to respond to unplanned RSTA missions (quick set-up, mission programming, and launch process); Retaskable: Able to be retasked while in flight; Communication/Data Link: and Communicate and display imagery to the seabased command post with no ground infrastructure.  Other UAV capability objectives include (but not limited to) the ability to communicate and display imagery to forces ashore simultaneously with the seabased command post, to launch and recover from amphibious ships, to image the targeted area from 10,000 feet AGL or above, to provide convoy overwatch during convoy operations, and to provide target acquisition.   Participation in Sea Viking 2006 could involve six days of 24-hour operations for each of the Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) Limited Technical Assessments (LTAs) and the Limited Objective Experiment (LOE).  The tentative time periods for the LTAs and the LOE are below: UAV LTA, 1 September 2005; UAV LTA, 2 December 2005; and ISR LOE, March 2006.

The UAV system must be capable of conducting its mission without relying on any ground infrastructure.  The Government will use responses from this Sources Sought Synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals nor will a contract follow as a result of this announcement.  Therefore, this synopsis must not be construed as a commitment by the government.

<SUBJECT>12--M119A2 Howitzer Fire Control
<SOLNBR>W52H090400000
<RESPDATE>100704
<ARCHDATE>12062004
<CONTACT>Linda Maes, (309)782-3657
<DESC>TACOM-RI is seeking interested sources for a potential requirement of approximately 212 to 450 each of the following components of the M119A2 Howitzer fire control.  For planning purposes for any resulting requirement, the Government would desire del ivery of a quantity of three of each component Apr 06 with production quantity deliveries to commence Nov 06 at a rate of eight each per month.   M90A3 Telescope:  The M90A3 Telescope is a lightweight, hermetically sealed, 3-power, fixed-focus optical inst rument equipped with a ballistic-type reticle.  The telescope can be quickly inserted and removed from the M186 Telescope Mount, which is mounted on the left side of the M119A2 Howitzer.  A lighting kit provides reticle illumination for night operation.  T he device is approximately one pound in weight, approximately 2 3/4 inches in diameter, 6 1/4 inches in length, 3-power with a 10-degree field of view.  It is comprised of a main casting with assembled machine parts.  Several lenses, windows, a reticle and  two porro-prisms are used in the optical train.  M137A2 Panoramic Telescope:  The M137A2 Panoramic Telescope is the basic instrument used in laying the M119A2 howitzer in azimuth.  The instrument is a 4-power, fixed-focus telescope with a 10-degree field of view.  It is mounted on the left side of the howitzer using the M187A1 Telescope Mount. The device weighs approximately 16-5/8 pounds, is approximately 16 3/4 inches high, 8 1/2 inches wide and 10 inches long. Construction consists primarily of several cast housings with precision machined gears, splines, worm, worm wheel, counters and clutches.  Additionally, lenses, prisms, windows and a reticle are included in the optical train.  The reticle and counters are illuminated for night operation.  Assembly requires expertise in fitting of parts, selective part selection and use of matched parts sets.  M140A1 Alignment Device:  The Alignment Device M140A1 provides on-carriage, mounted, close-in optical reference to provide boresight retention information rega rding the M137A2 Pantel. This device provides an illuminated target reticle at infinity and is mounted by means of a dovetail and clamp.  The device weighs approximately 11/4 pounds, is approximately 11 1/2 high, 4 inches wide and 4 inches long.   Construc tion is from machined metal parts.  Optical elements include windows, lenses and a reticle.  M186 Mount Telescope:  The M186 Mount Telescope provides mounting for the M90A3 Telescope to the left side of the M119A2 Howitzer.  It consists of a housing, 2 wor ms, 2 worm wheels and a dovetail with lock.  The device weighs approximately 2 pounds and is approximately 4 inches long, 5 inches wide and 2 1/2 inches high.  M187A1 Mount Telescope:  The Telescope, Mount M187A1 adapts the M137A2 Pantel to the M119A2 Howi tzer.  The mount provides adjustments in elevation and cant (cross-level) for indirect fire for the weapon.  The mount consists of two subassemblies, one mounted on top of the other and secured by four screws.  It, also, provides elevation readout by means  of the digital counter and flats for using the M1A1 Gunner's Quadrant.  It weighs approximately 38 pounds and is nominally 13 inches high, 9 3/4  inches wide and 14 1/8 inches long.  Elevation travel is -89 to 1333 mils.  Cross-level is  20 degrees. Count ers and level vials are illuminated for night operation.  The device consists of several castings, worms, worm wheels, 2 digital counters and machined parts.  Manufacture of these items will require the ability to perform precision machining, and assembly of instruments whereby all parts are manufactured to tolerance and additional skill and experience is required to assemble a compliant instrument.  Access to precision castings (either in-house or subcontracted items), ability to define, produce and acquir e gages and fixturing is required to assemble, test and accept product.  Familiarity with characteristics and assembly of gears is essential.  Ability to acquir e and assemble optical components, some of a complex nature, is necessary to assure compliance with end item requirements.  This will require translation of performance requirements of the instrument to tolerance definition of machined parts and fixtures/g ages.   A bidder's conference will be conducted 14 Oct 2004 at US Army TACOM, Rock Island, IL, for interested sources to ask questions, view the respective components, and clarify understanding of the technical/manufacturing requirements of the items.  A l ink has been established at http://tri.army.mil/LC/Cf/Cft/Cftl/m119/index.html for purposes of viewing current component drawings.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is issuing a Sources Sought/Pre-Solicitation Synopsis Notice to identify the potential sources capable of developing a SCORM 2004 Run-Time Environment.  This SCORM Run-Time Environment will support courseware hosted on the Marine Corps Distance Learning Network (MarineNet).  Upon review of the responses to this solicitation an RFP will be issued.  

The USMC’s goal is to replace the SCORM functionality provided by the existing Learning Management System (LMS) and incorporate additional functionality to be compliant with the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative’s SCORM 2004 specification.  Although this project will expand on the current capabilities of the MarineNet SCORM relayer software component to launch and track SCORM content, it is a new development effort not relying on reuse of the existing LMS code.  The SCORM 2004 RTE will be based upon a USMC-developed software design specification that will be released as part of the RFP solicitation.  

The software shall enable the delivery of SCORM 1.2 and 2004 content across a distributed cross-domain architecture with content hosted and pre-positioned near large student populations.  The software shall provide the necessary functionality required to track and present SCORM content in a responsive and secure manner taking into consideration the insecurity and high latency characteristics of wide-area IP network links.  The software shall be separated into two components: a centralized component responsible for session-to-session tracking, and a distributed or remote component responsible for in-session tracking.  The centralized component shall be responsible for importing SCORM meta-data, identifying an authenticated user, launching the content, and recording SCORM attempt data passed from the remote RTE component.  The remote RTE component shall be responsible for all SCO and multi-SCO tracking to include a fully conformant SCORM API Adapter and a SCORM 2004 sequencing engine.  

The software shall be compatible with existing and future USMC and NMCI common software baselines and comply with USMC and NMCI network security policies.  The central RTE components shall run on a Windows Server platform and use an Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server database to store data.  The remote RTE component shall run on a Windows Server platform and shall not require a database.  Cross-domain communications between the central and remote RTE components shall utilize only existing HTTP ports (TCP 80 and 443) and shall not rely on timely connections that may unduly hamper the student’s content sessions.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, is seeking qualified sources that can provide improved, digitally operated 2.75-Inch Rocket launchers for use by U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Army attack and special operations aircraft. The launchers will support all interface requirements of the current 2.75-inch guided and unguided family of rockets, and will replace the Navy’s LAU 61/68 rocket launchers and the Army’s M260 and M261 rocket launchers.  Interface requirements for the launchers include compliance with the MIL-STD-1760D Aircraft/Store Electrical Interconnection System (as a carriage store without a Carriage Store Station Interface), the two 23 and 26 pin connectors of the Rocket Management System (RMS), and a backward-compatible 5-pin analog interface through which 28 VDC firing pulses are sent to the launcher to fire rockets in a sequential order.  These launchers must be compatible with current 14-inch weapon suspension and release systems, have compatibility with current and future 2.75-inch rocket types (guided and unguided), and must provide the ability to set current Remote Settable Fuzed Rockets.  The launcher will include a safety switch that disables all firing circuit functions.  The launchers must be capable of upgrades to complement future guided rocket product improvements that may use MILSTD1553 or other digital communications from the launcher to the warhead/guidance systems.  The launchers must comply with the functional, physical, electrical, and messaging interfaces defined in the interface control document (ICD) that is available upon request.  The launchers must provide the launch platform with launcher built-in-test capability/status, individual tube functional status/rocket inventory, and the ability to fire rockets in individually selected tubes. The launcher will support uploading of software revisions to the launcher electronic assembly (LEA) through its MILSTD1760 connector. The launchers must be capable of detecting whether rockets are being ripple or single fired as well as keeping track of the total number of rockets fired over the life of the launcher.  The launcher must be loadable with rocket inventory data using currently available support equipment, as well as directly from the cockpit.   The rocket inventory must be capable of being uploaded to platforms from the launcher.  Electronic systems interfaces must be compatible with CMBRE test equipment. The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps has available an LEA for integration into the launcher that meets the ICD requirements.  The size, weight, and physical configuration of this LEA are available upon request.  

The launchers must be capable of 430 hours of aircraft carriage, with any number of tubes loaded. Each launcher must survive a minimum of 25 firings per tube (50 firings per tube desired) and survive 10 ripple firings.  The launchers must be capable of surviving off-aircraft handling and storage with any number of tubes loaded.  The launchers will provide increased mean-time-between-failure over existing 2.75 rocket launchers.  It is desired that the launchers be repairable at the Army Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) level. The launchers must improve the Insensitive Munitions performance of the rocket/launcher system, to include improved bullet and fragment impact and fast and slow cook-off protection. It is necessary to be able to harmonize the launcher’s aimpoint with the launch platform boresight.  The launchers must be tube loadable when mounted on aircraft.   The launchers must provide a significant weight reduction below currently deployed U.S. Navy/Marine Corps launchers on a per tube basis.  Current U.S. Navy/Marine Corp launchers contain 7 or 19 launch tubes and weigh 84 lbs and 155 lbs respectively.  Launcher weights less than the U.S. Army 2.75-inch 7 and 19 tube Rocket Launchers, which weigh  35 lbs and 85 lbs respectively, are desirable.  The launchers are not restricted to 7 and 19 tubes, but should provide a similar large/small load capability.  The launchers must be capable of operation on AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, and H-60 Series Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft, and the AH-64A, AH-64D, OH-58D, MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) and AH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).   It is desired that the launcher be capable of operation on F/A-18C/D/E/F, AV-8B, and JSF fixed wing aircraft.  Operation on unmanned air vehicles such as the Fire Scout and the Predator is also desired.  A growth capability will be provided for carriage of a variant of the launcher on M299 HELLFIRE missile launch rails, and will provide for interface through the HELLFIRE Missile shotgun connector using a signal set similar to that specified in MIL-STD 1760A.

  
All parties that currently have or will have the capability to provide the above-described launcher should submit the following information: technical material pertaining to your company's current or future capability to supply the specified launcher, past sales and performance information for both Government and Commercial sales; and any other additional information that could be useful in determining your company's ability to meet the requirements.   Information should be submitted no later than 15 September 2004 to the following address: NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, Contracts AIR-2.4.4.4.2, Attn: Michelle Plank, 47123 Buse Road, Building 2272, Suite 256, Patuxent River, MD  20670 or via email to michelle.plank@navy.mil.   Any party desiring to provide a briefing on their information submission should contact Michelle Plank at the above address.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

	This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) from the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Office of Space Launch (OSL), Advanced Programs Division (APD).  It is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contracts awarded as a result of proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the result of competition to the maximum extent practicable.   

	The NRO may contract with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those areas covered in this BAA.  The intent of the Advanced Programs Division is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the NRO to meet future launch needs.  Our goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible launch capabilities for our users when and where needed in the most cost-effective manner.  Specific research interests and objectives covered by this BAA are found in Section 1.  Proposed research should investigate truly new and unique approaches and techniques that lead to, or enable revolutionary and evolutionary improvements in capability, performance, and cost.   

	Offerors may submit proposals on any topic either contained within this BAA or related to a BAA topic.  Prior to submitting a proposal, offerors shall contact the Technical Points of Contact (POC), identified with the description of the corresponding research.  The type of research effort contemplated should be understood and validated by the OSL technical representative prior to a potential Offeror expending extensive time and effort preparing a detailed technical proposal.  Proposals submitted that have not been pre-coordinated with the appropriate technical POC shall not be evaluated or otherwise be considered for contract award.  In addition, Offerors shall identify on the cover page of their proposal which of the three (3) topic areas (by topic number and title) is/are addressed in their proposal.  Offerors are reminded that this exchange of information in no way implies the Government will fund the concept once formally submitted in a proposal.  Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.  

	The period of performance for proposals submitted in response to this BAA may be up to a maximum of one (1) year.  Proposals shall contain a brief summary of the work and a ceiling rough order of magnitude (CROM) price.  It is the Government’s intent to restrict the value of any contract awarded as a result of this BAA to a maximum price of $350K per contract.  The Government anticipates award of contracts not later than 1 Mar 2005.  Offerors shall submit proposals not later than 29 November 2004 with a proposal validity date through 1 April 2005.  Offerors are cautioned that award of any contract(s) pursuant to this BAA is subject to the availability of funds.

	All written communications, including submission of proposals pursuant to this 
BAA, shall be forwarded to the OSL Contracting Office Point of Contact, Ms. Debra Hawkins, Contracting Officer, who can be reached at (310) 416-7453.  Please call Ms. Hawkins only if you have questions of a contractual nature.  Technical questions/comments should be directed to the technical points of contact listed in Section 1 herein.
 
SECTION 1 - RESEARCH INTERESTS: Specific technology areas of interest for this BAA are listed below:

Topic 1:  Parts Certification and Qualification:  The primary goal of this BAA topic area is to seek new, improved and/or innovative methods for providing high confidence that all of the parts, components and flight hardware for launch vehicles (boosters, solid rocket motors, upper stages, etc.) are accurately built to the correct specification and will perform as intended.  This is directly related to OSL’s Mission Assurance process.  Recent NRO experience with both boosters as well as spacecraft programs has demonstrated that problems down to the piece part level are being discovered late in the processing cycle and result in unforeseen program delays.  This, in turn, results in schedule slips, higher program costs, and perturbations to master program schedules.  These parts problems often have the unintended consequence of crossing over to other booster or satellite programs and result in negative impacts.

The root cause for recent parts problems is unknown.  Some speculation points to an aging work force giving way to a younger inexperienced work force.  While determining the root cause with any degree of confidence may be unachievable, the overall focus on parts reliability remains our focus.  Offerors should address the entire parts production process to include, but not limited to, the following:  manufacturing, testing, quality control, screening, certification, qualification, standardization, re-work, configuration control and reliability.  We are also interested in commercially produced parts that have both space and non-space applications and understanding the differences in the production processes but not to the exclusion of satellite vehicle production processes.  Offerors should attempt to identify the potential benefits of their concepts to the launch integration community specifically focusing on the mission assurance process.  Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that require the creation of new software or databases. 

TECHNICAL POC:  Mr. Rob Spicer  (703) 808-3055
Email:  rob.spicer@osl.nro.mil

Topic 2:  Advanced Launch Vehicle Technologies for Operationally Responsive Space Launch:  Several initiatives external to the NRO are underway that focus on a responsive space launch capability.  For example, the Chief of Staff, Air Force (CSAF) has embraced a new concept called Joint Warfighting Space (JWS) to rapidly launch satellites in direct support of a joint force commander.  The AF Scientific Advisory Board is just completing a study on Operationalizing Space Launch.  This study focused on launching a 1000 lb satellite within 48 hours.  Similarly, OSL is interested in a responsive launch capability.  OSL is interested in improvements, innovative methods, technologies, unique ideas, etc. that would render existing launch systems more responsive.  Additionally, OSL is interested in new launch systems that provide a more responsive launch capability.  This new launch system should address smaller satellites (1000 kg) and focus on simplified methods for payload integration, test, checkout and launch.  Each approach should have a payoff in terms of schedule, cost and risk mitigation that is consistent with the established OSL mission assurance process.

The primary purpose of this topic is to focus on launch capabilities for technical demonstration satellites.  The NRO is developing a plan to launch at least one tech demo satellite per year.  The OSL mission includes being able to provide a launch service for each of these tech demo satellites and ensure that the overall mission integration process for each of these satellites can be accomplished in an efficient manner.  Offerors should include enough technical detail on the proposed system to enable OSL to assess its technical maturity and feasibility.  The tech demo satellite program will not be successful if the associated launch services cannot support the annual launch timeline.  Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that require the creation of new software or databases.

TECHNICAL POC:  Mr. Steve Wojcicki  (703) 808-0528
Email:  stephen.wojcicki@osl.nro.mil

Topic 3: New Approaches for Secondary Payloads: OSL is interested in approaches for secondary payloads that will not complicate the integration of the prime satellite with the boost vehicle.  Unique payload adaptors, below the prime satellite, complicate the integration process to an extent that the primes are reluctant to entertain ride sharing.  These special adaptors reduce available payload fairing volume for the prime and complicate loads analyses by moving the prime satellite forward in the payload fairing envelope.  The ideal ride share approach would provide the small satellite to the prime early in the schedule so that it could be included in all systems level tests performed by the prime.  The required analyses would be so benign that no additional effort would have to be performed by the prime.  Typical objections of prime satellites to ride sharing are:  
-	The sub-satellite/adaptor creates a unique loads case, which increases the complexity of the prime’s analyses 
-	The sub-satellite is not available early in the prime’s build schedule and, therefore, cannot be integrated in the systems level tests
-	There is added risk to environments e.g. contamination, thermal, shock, acoustics, vibration, etc.
-	The sub-satellite characteristics (weight, volume, etc.) are not available until late in the schedule
-	The sub-satellites typically are on a very small and tight budget and cannot be flexible enough to support to prime’s schedule changes

Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that provide lengthened adaptors for the purpose of carrying small satellites below the prime satellite.  The offerors are encouraged to provide unique approaches that will not be objectionable to primary missions.  Any approach that encourages the primes to seek sub-satellites as a ride share would be of special interest.

<DESC>1.0	SUBJECT

Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) for an automated shipboard system 
designed to move, store and retrieve ISO containers (20 foot) on a ship underway.  
Responses to this RFI are due by 12:00 PM (Noon) on Friday, October 29, 2004.  See 
section 9.0 for complete point of contact information.

2.0	PURPOSE

ATI seeks sources (technology providers) and information (concepts) for the 
development of an Automated Shipboard ISO Container Movement, Stowage and 
Retrieval System.  ATI plans to use the information provided as a basis for preparing an 
RFP(s) for some or all portions of the systems discussed as part of this RFI.  ATI is not 
seeking a proposal from any supplier.  It is seeking input from all suppliers with reference 
to this proposed project.  Comments as to the viability of proposed systems, any 
advantages or disadvantages of system defined and any recommendations to add or delete 
components, technologies, or requirements to better meet the needs of the project are 
sought.  Ultimately, the information provided would support ATI in preparing a 
meaningful RFP(s) that will receive a favorable response from several providers.

Should ATI elect to release an RFP following the evaluation of RFI responses, 
respondents to the RFI will be invited, but not required to participate in any subsequent 
processes.  Responders are not required to participate in the RFI process as a condition or 
pre-qualification relative to any future response to an RFP.  Should ATI release an RFP, 
respondents to this solicitation will not receive additional evaluation points by virtue of 
submitting a response to the RFI.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely 
voluntary and any and all costs of participation in this process will be the complete 
responsibility of the respondent.

3.0	DESCRIPTION
      
Currently, containers are loaded and unloaded onboard ships in port using cranes and 
container cell guides, then stowed in place until the next port of call without being moved 
while at sea.  To support military operations, the goal of future systems would be to 
receive, transfer, stow and retrieve containers at sea, maximize cargo handling rate 
(throughput), minimize manpower requirements, and provide 100% selectivity.  A fully 
loaded 20-foot ISO container weighs approximately 53,000 pounds.

The concept envisioned is an automated end-to-end container movement and stowage 
solution.  The system should provide the full range of automated warehousing 
capabilities and would also act as the prime mover of containers from the point of 
receipt/transfer on deck, to/from/within stowage locations, and to/from a breakout and 
repackaging station or any combination of the foregoing.
	
The best concepts would include stowage solutions applicable to 3-dimensional 
configurations (stacked) in the case of a dedicated stowage hold; as well as 2-dimensional 
configurations (not stacked) to support convertible employment of available deck space 
(i.e., between RoRo and container stowage). 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

*	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to automated 
movement, stowage and retrieval of 20-foot ISO containers onboard a ship at sea
*	Identification of the primary technical challenges to be addressed
*	Approximate cost information (e.g., rough order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, 
etc.) for alternatives

4.0	ASSUMPTIONS

*	20-foot ISO containers will be delivered to an open deck area
*	In the case of a dedicated stowage hold assume that the hold would be sized for 
six containers wide by four containers long stacked six containers high for 
purposes of this effort.
*	In the case of a convertible stowage space assume that the system would be sized 
for ten containers wide by four containers long, one level high
*	System takes over after the ISO container lands on the ship
*	System may eventually need to meet the requirements of NAVSEA OP 4, 
Ammunition and Explosives Safety Afloat

5.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for this effort.

*	The system should be fully or semi automatic.  Semi-automatic means that one 
operator can operate the system from a fixed location
*	The system(s) would be required to maintain positive control of the load at all 
times while the ship is operating in seas up to and including sea state 5
*	Survivable (held in place) through sea state 9
*	At a minimum, the system should be able to move containers horizontally both 
fore/aft and athwartships from the point of entry to either the breakout location or 
a stowage location (i.e., to/from the point of receipt/transfer on deck, 
to/from/within stowage, and to/from a breakout and repackaging station or any 
combination of the foregoing)
*	Move containers up/down from one deck to another including necessary 
vertical/horizontal transitions
*	Access any (index) position within stowage
*	In the case of a dedicated stowage hold, the system must be able to deliver any 
specified container from any location within stowage to an offload station at the 
top aft end of the stack
*	Rotate containers 90, 180 or 270 degrees as necessary at points in transit on the 
ship to allow efficient vertical and horizontal movement and stowage
*	The actual container throughput rates are not known at this time, however the 
system should be able to move the containers as quickly as possible
*	The system(s) shall be capable of handling ISO containers carrying packaged 
cargo ordnance and ammunition.
*	The systems shall also meet the cargo stowage and handling requirements of 
reference (1), specifically sections 3.2.2 and Appendix I.  Load factors for sea 
state effects shall be in accordance with reference (1)

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated 
above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to 
make and document such assumptions in their responses.

ATI encourages vendor partnering and encourages the participation of any and all 
vendors, suppliers, and/or integrators.  ATI seeks innovative suggestions in regard to an 
automated ISO container movement, stowage and retrieval solution.

3.0	DESCRIPTION
      
Currently, containers are loaded and unloaded using standard forklift trucks or personnel 
carrying items into and out of the container.  This is relatively slow and manpower 
intensive.  The goal of future systems would be to improve the cargo handling rate while 
reducing the required manpower.  

The concept envisioned is a fully or semi-automated system to breakout and repack 20-
foot ISO containers.  Semi-automated means that one operator can operate the system 
from a fixed location, i.e., using some form of human amplification technology/robotics.  
The system should not rely on standardization of container packaging, but be able to 
handle any variety of pallets, cases, packaged ordnance, boxes or other intermediate 
packaging assemblies.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

*	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to the automated cargo 
breakout and repacking of 20-foot ISO containers onboard a ship at sea
*	Identification of the primary technical challenges to be addressed
*	Approximate cost information (e.g., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) 
for alternatives

4.0	ASSUMPTIONS

*	20-foot ISO containers are located on an open deck area (below decks) when they 
are loaded or unloaded
*	Containers can contain a number of different types of material and packaging, 
including stores, ammunition (palletized or packaged) and small weapons
*	System may eventually need to meet the requirements of NAVSEA OP 4, 
Ammunition and Explosives Safety Afloat
	
5.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for this effort.

*	Fully or semi-automated operation.  Semi-automated means that one operator can 
operate the system from a fixed location, i.e., using some form of human 
amplification technology/robotics
*	Unload cargo from container as fast as the container can be brought onboard, 
estimated at 10 minutes
*	The system(s) would be required to maintain positive control of the load at all 
times while the ship is operating in seas up to and including sea state 5
*	Doors are located on container ends
*	The system must be able to handle a wide variety of package sizes and shapes 
including intermediate packaging assemblies (like Army/Marine intermediate 
platforms)
*	Place cargo removed from container onto a specific location (e.g., belt, conveyor, 
truck, ASRS, etc.) to transfer the load elsewhere for stowage or delivery (moving 
the cargo loads is outside the scope of this effort)
*	Breakout throughput must be equal to or better than man/forklift combinations
*	The system must address the disposition of retrograde
*	The system(s) shall be capable of handling ISO containers carrying packaged 
cargo ordnance and ammunition.
*	The systems shall also meet the cargo stowage and handling requirements of 
reference (1), specifically sections 3.2.2 and Appendix I.  Load factors for sea 
state effects shall be in accordance with reference (1)

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated 
above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to 
make and document such assumptions in their responses.

ATI encourages vendor partnering and encourages the participation of any and all 
vendors, suppliers, and/or integrators.  ATI seeks innovative suggestions in regard to an 
automated ISO container breakout and repacking solution.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research Registry for Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five (5) years.  The CHMC was originally awarded a five (5) year contract in September, 1994, for the project entitled “Research Registry for Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.”  The purpose of the contract was to establish a research registry for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).  The Contractor developed, maintains, and systematically updates a disease registry for JRA with the focus on multicase families with affected sib pairs.  In conjunction with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, the CHMC continuously promotes the use of the Registry as a national resource to facilitate research by providing adequate numbers of subjects for study, thus enhancing the national research effort in childhood arthritis.  The purpose of this extension is four fold.  First, the additional time will allow the incumbent to continue to enroll affected sib pairs to meet its enrollment goals and to follow-up the sib pairs.  Second, it will allow for enrollment of multiplex and simplex families to include under-represented JRA subtypes and under-represented ethnicities long-term follow-up of sib pairs with JRA.  Third, to carry out pilot studies exploring the relationships of observed genetic linkage or associations with observed clinical features of disease and disease pathogenesis using novel technologies such as proteomic profiling using mass spectrometry.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The  CHMC is determined to be the only responsible source for the following reasons: (1) the CHMC leads a unique national effort dedicated to the collection and characterization of JRA sib pairs and is in a unique position to enroll simplex and multiplex families; (2) the CHMC has developed and implemented a system for sib pair accrual, based on strict enrollment criteria; and (3) the CHMC has unique invaluable resources at its disposal such as 197 sib pairs from 179 families, DNA from 155 families, 425 simplex families, and 69 Hispanic simplex families and comprehensive clinical data, including quantitative trait data on all patients, including therapeutic history.  Therefore, the CHMC has the unique capability to perform this work.  This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC> Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is planning to issue a short term (not to exceed 90 days) sole-source contract to ensure the continuity of courier services for the Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) and the Center for Retirement and Insurance Services (CRIS) co-located in Boyers, PA and the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The current vendor, VGA Enterprises 14625 Baltimore Ave., Suite 228, Laurel, MD, 20707, is the only responsible source at this time that has personnel qualified to carry out the courier service to the CFIS and CRIS locations due to the background investigation requirements imposed under 5CFR 731 and 736 with a sensitivity designation level of Critical Sensitive. It is not reasonably possible to clear new vendor personnel by the expiration date of the existing contract; the time period it takes to clear personnel with the sensitivity designation of Critical Sensitive is 35 days or longer. It is critical to the CFIS and CRIS missions that the courier service is maintained without delay during the acquisition process to implement a long term courier solution. Therefore, VGA Enterprises is the intended source for this short term requirement. The anticipated contract action for this service is not anticipated to be greater than $100,000. OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 492110, Couriers. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

Questions for subject RFQ,s.
 
1.) Will all refuelers be available at the same time? If not how many?

    We can send only one refueler at a time because we currently have three refuelers deployed. 

2.) Is the military or other designated activity responsible to deliver and pick-up refuelers upon completion?
   
 We would prefer the contractor pick up the refuelers but if this would increase the price significantly, we would drive the refuelers or have LRS transport the refuelers.

3.) Can the awarded contractor accomplish both items on the base? If so where?

  No.
