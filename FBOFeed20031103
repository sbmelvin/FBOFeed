<DESC>A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) RELEVANT TO RAPID INNOVATION ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION, INTEGRATION, AND FIELDING OF JOINT TACTICAL BATTLE MANAGEMENT AND COMMAND AND CONTROL (BMC2) FUNCTIONALITY FOR AEROSPACE WARFARE: Overview: The Joint Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) System Engineering Organization (JSSEO) announces its process for fostering innovation in the development of the SIAP Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM). The IABM is an automated specification, in the form of a computer program written in executable UML®, using the Object Management Group's (OMG®) Model Driven Architecture (MDA®) . The IABM, when integrated in elements of the Department of Defense (DoD) joint tactical integrated air and missile defense portfolio, will improve critical combat capabilities by:  · reducing the risk of fratricide; · opening up the battle space to employ weapons to the ir designed kinematic range; and · supporting the capability to counter emerging threats Application computer programs that develop a mutually consistent distributed database within a distributed, peer-to-peer network will improve tactical battle management and command and control for the aerospace warfare mission area. The Government has determined that the MDA® approach produces a clear description of the behavior of individual peers in the peer-to-peer network, while facilitating effective communications with industry partners. Furthermore, the model-driven design of the IABM:  ·  enables JSSEO to take  adopt innovative concepts and algorithms, facilitated by a modular, open system design; · supports formal  processes to  evaluate the completeness and correctness of the iteratively developed IABM; and, · facilitates  continuous and systematic  testing of the IABM in t he Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) technical framework environment. To be successful, the IABM must take advantage of innovative concepts and algorithms that industry, academia, and government  will share in a collaborative environment. The ability of the Government and industry partners to  share and adapt innovative ideas provides a "best of breed" solution meeting near-term military needs and aligned with longer-term SIAP requirements and objectives. A collaborative approach further serves to enhance modular design, reduce time to field, and encourages early identification and  adoption of the most innovative concepts and algorithms to improve joint warfighting capabilities. Process:  Operational requirements for the SIAP capability are based on the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated Capstone Requirements Documents (i.e., Theater Air and M issile Defense (TAMD), Combat Identification (CID), and Global Information Grid (GIG)).  Additional requirements sources include:  · Operational Requirements Documents (ORD), Capability Development Documents (CDD), and Capability Production Documents (CPD) from the SIAP Partner Program Offices (e.g., AWACS, Patriot, E_2C, AEGIS); · Service Concepts of Link Employment (COLE); · The Operational Views of the TAMD Integrated Architecture; and, · DoD and Joint Staff directives and instructions. The JSSEO is working with the military services to develop operational threads (e.g., Targeting, Passive Defense/Early Warning, Integrated Combat Airspace Command and Control) that give the requirements an operational context within which to identify SIAP-relevant operational nodes, activities and data elements that can be traced back to the top-level operational requirements.  These o perational threads are used to update Operational Views (OV) constructed using the DoD Architecture Framework (DoD AF) as format guidance.  The operational requirements are allocated to operational elements, such as operational nodes, activities, or data exchanges within these views.  The  OV's and the operational requirements trace will continue to be approved incrementally using established DoD processes.    The IABM will be developed at two functional levels: a design for the distributed system and a design for the individual Peer Computing Program (PCP), the computer program that when implemented in Service systems provides the SIAP capability.  System level requirements will be developed for the distributed system, and a correlation will be made between operational requirements and distributed system requirements.  Distributed system requirements will be allocated to va rious system elements or functions. This will yield a requirements-based OV-to-System View (SV) mapping process. System requirements for the PCP will be derived to satisfy the set of distributed system requirements.  There will also be several technical system requirements added to the IABM development process, including: · Joint Technical Architecture (see JTA, Version 5.0 dtd 4 Apr 03, at http://www-jta.itsi.disa.mil/); · Link-16 Single Link Interface Requirements Specification (SLIRS); · IABM functional baseline, functional architecture, and object model; · Global Information Grid (GIG) and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Technical Standards; and, · SIAP Partner system requirements and specifications. The Government will use an automated toolset to maintain traceability between the architecture products and their allocated requirements, thus enabling export of  system level requirements into the IABM computer program development environment for allocation to specific classes. The IABM will be developed using an iterative "spiral" type development process to enable the Government and industry partners to continuously develop and adapt the IABM to meet evolving military operational and system needs. Incorporating lessons learned from the Navy's undersea warfare domain experience, four dominant management principles will guide development of the IABM: q Collaboration. To encourage innovation within a fair and objective framework, the JSSEO opens participation in the IABM development process to all potential contributors (with appropriate national security caveats). The JSSEO will fully disclose the emerging IABM baseline, enabling potential contributors to compare and contrast their ideas in the context of a complete, distr ibuted system.  q Peer Review. The JSSEO will use Government-led peer review groups composed of nationally recognized authorities with the most relevant technical expertise's. These groups actively seek the best algorithms and methods from industry, academia, and Government sources. The peer review groups will objectively evaluate potential contributions, providing information and recommendations to the Government lead to select the best alternatives.  The peer review groups will assess products against near and longer-term SIAP and IABM requirements and development objectives. q Build-Test-Build/Operational Feedback. Warfighter/user review and feedback concerning the IABM is fundamental to development and fielding of an operationally suitable and operationally effective joint BMC2 capability.  Operational feedback is established by  several means, including analysis of J oint warfighter needs (e.g., TAMD CRD, CID CRD, GIG CRD, and Unified Joint Task List (UTJL)/Join Mission Essential Task Lists (JMETL)), after-action reports of military operations, training exercises and evaluations, and lessons-learned knowledge bases.  Additionally, with the use of an operationally realistic test environment and a flexible computer model of the JTAMD Architecture, JSSEO JTAMD system performance can be benchmarked.  To achieve and ensure consistency for each evaluation means, a Joint, community-approved, Defense Planning Guidance (DPG)-based operational context is required.  Common Reference Scenarios (CRS's) provide this common operational environment and establish the baseline of system performance from the engineering level to the military utility level.  The common operational context provides sufficient detail to support integrated air warfare M&S, Hardwa re In the Loops (HWIL) exercises, Operator In The Loop (OITL) exercises, and Live exercises.  CRS development relies upon subject matter experts to represent the interests of individual service and agency initiatives and programs and an active process to authoritatively define operational architectures and requirements from the standpoint of joint operations. q Reduced Implementation Time. After initial deployment, the JSSEO will deliver to integrating system program managers an updated, improved-capability, configuration-controlled IABM every twenty-four (24) months. Rapid delivery of updated versions of the IABM ensures that the IABM will maintain technology currency and disciplined innovation insertion.  Current Schedule:  The current JSSEO schedule calls for design and engineering activities in FY04 to support a September 2005 release of  IABM Configuration 05, with   subsequent IABM releases approximately every 24 months. Key capabilities for Configuration 05  are the Track Management, Combat Identification, and Distributed Resource Management domains.

<SUBJECT>10--CONSOLIDATED UNDERSEA WEAPONS HARDWARE PRODUCTION CONTRACT
<SOLNBR>N0002404R6101
<CONTACT>Renee' Brooks 202-781-2827   Renee' Brooks, Contract Specialist, at 202-781-2827 or William Randolph, Contracting Officer, at 202-781-3918!!
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC, anticipates awarding a sole source, firm fixed-price (FFP) contract to Raytheon Electronic Systems, Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Keyport, WA for the consolidated procurement of following undersea weapons: the MK48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Mod 6 Heavyweight Torpedo, the MK48 CBASS Mod 7 Heavyweight (HWT) Torpedo and the MK54 Mod 0 Lightweight (LWT) Torpedo. The Navy has embarked on this particular acquisition strategy for current undersea weapons hardware requirements based on the need for lower priced assets, the uniqueness of torpedo manufacturing and the current low volumes of production. The Navy envisions a single prime production supplier who can work synergistically with the Navy torpedo enterprise to efficiently and cost effectively produce these hardware assets. The results of the market research performed i n April 2003 confirmed original programmatic expectations that in order to ensure responsiveness to Fleet inventory needs for torpedo assets, sustain a skilled torpedo workforce, achieve significant production process improvements, achieve substantial component commonality across product lines and realize considerable procurement and life cycle costs savings, the consolidation of existing torpedo product lines under one collaborative contract vehicle must be undertaken. The base year of the consolidated undersea weapons contract is anticipated to satisfy the Navy's FY04 undersea weapons requirements and include four one-year options covering anticipated requirements in FY05 through FY08. The consolidated product lines considered under this procurement are described as follows: 1) the MK48 ADCAP Mod 6 is currently the Navy's primary submarine launched conventional ASW and ASUW t orpedo asset. It is anticipated that the resulting solicitation and contract, in concert with current funding streams and Government estimates, will allow the Navy to procure MK48 ADCAP Mod 6 quantities of approximately 76 in FY04  and approximately an additional 80 in FY05. No additional MK48 ADCAP Mod 6 assets are anticipated for production in FY06 through FY08; 2) the MK48 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) is an upgrade to the MK48 Mod 6 (ACOT configured) torpedo. This upgrade is referred to as the MK48 CBASS Mod 7 torpedo.  It is anticipated that the resulting solicitation and contract, in concert with current funding streams and Government estimates, will allow the Navy to procure MK48 CBASS Mod 7 quantities of approximately 14 in FY04 and up to approximately 350 in FY05 through FY08; and 3) the MK54 Mod 0 is a modular upgrade to the U.S. Navy lightweight torp edo inventory, combining existing MK46 Mod 5A(S) hardware with subsystems of the MK50 and MK48 ADCAP torpedoes, and commercial off-the-shelf processor components. It is anticipated that the resulting solicitation and contract, in concert with current funding streams and Government estimates, will allow the Navy to procure MK54 torpedo quantities of approximately 36 in FY04 and up to approximately 830 units in FY05 through FY08. Additional quantities may be authorized or appropriated by Congress for each of the three product lines as needed. Also contemplated in this consolidated procurement will be the purchase of research and development efforts, software, associated unit spares, non-recurring engineering services and support, related program data (technical manuals, reports, training/curriculum aids, etc.) proofing support, test equipment and contingency Engineering Change Pr oposal (ECP) and Government Furnished Equipment and Property (GFE/P) repair line items for all product lines, as required. Furthermore, in terms of the anticipated contract structure, aggressive contract incentives addressing unit cost reductions and quality are anticipated as well as the promotion of increased utilization of small business concerns. In total, this contract is anticipated to provide the Navy with a contract vehicle to efficiently and cost-effectively acquire additional air and surface deliverable torpedoes and support services in order to combat existing and projected submarine threats. Raytheon IDS (Keyport) is currently the producer of the MK48 ADCAP Mod 6 and co-designer, developer and producer of the MK54 Mod 0 torpedo.  It is the only source with the design familiarity, proven vendor base, demonstrated production processes and existing facilities and tooli ng required to meet the Navy's requirements for these two product lines. As for the MK48 CBASS Mod 7 torpedo, Raytheon has extensive experience with the MK48 torpedo platform itself and has proven experience in the design of wideband capable sonar systems and components. Furthermore, the company has in-depth experience in the development of associated advanced signal processing algorithms and hardware and software integration. Firms interested in subcontract or subassembly opportunities should contact Raytheon Electronic Systems, Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) directly. The subcontracting point of contact is Mr. Tony Forrest and can be reached at 360-394-3411 or by e-mail at Tony_E_Forrest@raytheon.com.*****

<CONTACT>Traci Mercer  (202) 781-2931 11. Contracts Specialist, Traci Mercer (202) 781-2931, Contracting Officer, William C. Randolph (202) 781-3918!!
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Washington Navy Yard, DC, intends to issue a firm fixed price (FFP) Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting full and open competition for the manufacture, test, delivery and support of MK30 Mod 2 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Training Targets. The MK 30 Mod 2 ASW Training Target is an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) anti-submarine warfare training target system that supports both helicopter and boat launch and recovery and whose mission is to simulate a submarine for purposes of training sonar operators and testing underwater weapons. This target vehicle provides cost-effective training services for submarine, surface ship and aircraft crews to employ their sensors and weapon systems in realistic and operationally representative situations.  The MK 30 Mod 2 ASW Training Target is a planned upgrade replacement to the current fleet ASW Target Systems (ATS), the MK 30 Mod 1. The MK 30 Mod 1 was introduced into the fleet in 1975 and is currently out of production.  Within the next ten (10) years, the MK30 Mod 1 attrition rates will deplete inventories below the amount needed to support fleet training.  Consequently, production units in the new MK30 Mod 2 system configuration are required to provide the Fleet with a highly reliable, maintainable and, especially, affordable training target system to replace the aging MK 30 Mod 1. Based on existing funding, program profiles and Government estimates, it is anticipated that the resulting competitive contract will provide for the procurement of approximately six (6) targets in FY04 with four one-year options to acquire as many as an additional thirty (30) MK30 Mod 2 production units, or other quantities as may be authorized or appropriated by Congress, to satisfy fleet requ irement over the following four (4) years (FY05 through FY08).  In addition to the hardware units described above, the resulting contract is anticipated to provide for the purchase of research and development efforts, software, associated units spares, non-recurring engineering services and support, related program data (technical manuals, reports, training/curriculum aids, etc), proofing support, workshop test and handling equipment, and contingency Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and Government Furnished Equipment and Property (GFE/P) repair line items, as required. The Government currently anticipates that the evaluation criteria used in this competition will focus strongly on related past performance, price and technical approach and capability. The anticipated competition will most likely be based upon a build-to-print hardware specification and testing executed to an ex isting performance-based specifications. Furthermore, in terms of the resulting contract structure, aggressive contract incentives focusing on substantial unit price reductions and asset quality are anticipated as well as the promotion of increased utilization of small business concerns. In total, this contract is anticipated to provide the Navy with a contract vehicle to efficiently and cost-effectively acquire training targets and support services in order to support fleet readiness needs.

<DESC>The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The Office of Air and Radiation has a requirement for NAS (as set forth in a Congressional Committee Conference Report) to perform an independent review and evaluation of the practices and procedures by which States develop separate mobile source emission standards (both on-highway and nonroad) as compared to the practices and procedures used by EPA under the Clean Air Act. Under the proposed procurement, NAS will provide expert advice by convening a review committee that will perform the following: (A) review the process by which States assess their need to reduce emissions through state mobile source emission standards separate from those established by EPA;  (B) review the federal mechanisms and requirements which allow California to adopt and enforce separate mobile source emission standards and for States other than California to adopt and enforce mobile source emission standards based on California's standards;  (C) shall review how expected emissions reductions, air quality and health benefits are accounted for in the state emissions standards setting process; and, (D) determine how the rationale and methodologies used by California and the States in setting their own mobile source emission standards compare with those used by EPA.    THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above. Documentation must be received by November 19, 2003 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.  See Note 26

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement for the development of efficacious preventative and therapeutic vaccines against HIV/AIDS for worldwide use in stemming the AIDS epidemic.  To augment the vaccine product pipeline, we are seeking opportunities to advance vaccine concepts toward the product stage via a focused, development-based approach.  Specifically, the long-range goal of this solicitation is the development of new safe and immunogenic vaccine candidates that merit further evaluation in larger human trials. The HIV Vaccine Design and Development Teams (HVDDT) solicitation seeks to fund consortia of scientists with development experience from industry and/or academia that have 1) identified a promising vaccine concept, and 2) devised a plan for its targeted development into a vaccine product.  A vaccine product is defined here to be a material and its manner of administration that could reasonably provide protection against AIDS.  Offerors are encouraged, but not required to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with NIAID/DAIDS-supported HIV/AIDS vaccine trials networks.  Support for phase III studies will not be funded under this solicitation. 

It is anticipated that up to four (4) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 30, 2004.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR X-Ray Mirror Metrology Station.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer additional questions from industry. The questions and the answers to those questions are as follows: Questions: The paragraph on "Radius" in Section 2.1 says that "the combination of coarse and fine (radial) motions must allow accurate (to &lt;= 10 nm rms)sensing of either relative ... or absolute radius to this level." Table 1, though, lists 0.01 mm (10 microns) as the "positioning accuracy" for coarse radial motion and 0.01 micron (10 nm) as the "positioning accuracy" for fine radial motion.  Section 2.1 and Table 1 seem to conflict.  Could you confirm that the intent is to measure axial profiles with an accuracy of 10 nm rms, while measuring the absolute radius of the test piece to an accuracy of 10 microns rms? Can you confirm that there is no requirement to build a support mechanism for the test piece, and that the vendor simply needs to allow room for a Government-supplied test piece holder? Answer: The answer to both questions is yes. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 11/12/03.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to pertinent questions.

Part 1 questions regarding the capability of the trainer:

2. For rapid reconfiguration, are we looking at different driver station configurations based on the vehicle configuration, or are we looking at changes in the driver station over time due to evolution?

PEOSTRI response:  Changes to the driver station to be reconfigurable for other vehicle configurations.

7. Who are the other occupants?  The driver station of a driver trainer would typically only provide a view from the driver station and the other vehicle occupants would not be included.

PEOSTRI response:  The driver station will be for one person only (the driver).

12. When you address the embedded diagnostic and trouble-shooting are you talking about the small advisory box installed now, or are we talking about a future capability for diagnostics and trouble-shooting.

PEOSTRI response:  This is for the driver to be able to trouble shoot and diagnose the system from the driver station.  It is not a future capability.

Part 2 questions regarding information to be provided to the government:

1. Are you looking for pictures and a description of our current driver trainer or the device we envision for Stryker?

PEOSTRI response:  This is meant to be for any existing driver training device already available or if there is a concept for what the STRYKER driver trainer would be it would be very good to see what they have.  The idea is to see what is available, what have the contractors worked in the past that is related to this program, and who they have applied whatever technology they want to use in this driver trainer.

2.  Please clarify austere locations on a stand alone configuration.  Is this a trainer in a container on a hard stand in Kuwait or something else?

PEOSTRI response:  It could very well be a system in a container that we can put out in the field and be able to operate with or without an external power supply.

5. Please clarify if this COTS?GFE software and hardware and to what detail you are looking for.

PEOSTRI response:  If there is an existing driving training device similar to what we may want, we will like to know information on the COTS and/or GFE used in this system.  Also, if the contractor has an idea on the concept for the STRYKER driver trainer, we want to know information on the COTS and/or GFE they may want us to provide.

PEOSTRI is seeking industry information regarding the availability of a Driver Trainer device suitable for the STRYKER family of vehicles and possibly the development of a common driver trainer platform for use with non-STRYKER tactical and non-tactical vehicle modules. It can be a combination of new development and already developed hardware and software components that provide effective and efficient training for the driver of the STRYKER crews and potentially other tactical and non-tactical vehicles. 

The STRYKER Driver Trainer shall provide the following capabilities:

1.Train the driver in basic driving skills and tactical maneuver during combat and tactical training, and in support and deploying conditions.

2. Modular to allow the rapid reconfiguration into other variations of the STRYKER vehicle.

3. Replicate the STRYKER drivers compartment, all the driving controls, the vehicle dashboard, lights, indicators, switches, instruments and pedals.

4. Simulate all environmental conditions, to include but not limited to day, night, rain, fog, dusk, dawn, snow, ice, etc.

5. Simulate the driving of the vehicle in different terrains, to include but not limited to mountains, urban, off-road, roads & highways, steep grades and sharp turns, and driving threats (man-made and nature).

6. Simulate the communication system between the driver and other crew members both internal and external.

7. Provide a visual system that creates a realistic representation of the database use to train the driver and simulate all views for driver and other occupants.

8. Simulate the sense of speed, bumps and motions as a minimum.

9. Provide a sound system that creates a high-quality reproduction of continuous and asynchronous vehicle sounds and that correlates to the environmental conditions as well as the visual scene.

10. Provide a motion system that allows realistic representation of the terrain and the actions performed by the driver.

11. Replicate the vehicle performance in accordance with the terrain and the actions taken by the driver, to include vehicle malfunctions.

12. Provide embedded diagnostic and trouble-shooting capability for the driver.

13. Instructor/Operator Station (IOS) that provides control and monitoring of training, data on the drivers performance, scoring, selection of malfunction, gather/record training data, and select environmental conditions.

14. Provide After-Action-Review (AAR) capability.

15. Capability to reuse government provided visual databases, models developed in other programs, and training exercises.

16. Comply with DoDD 8500.1, Information Assurance (IA) and DoDI 8500.2 IA Implementation.

17. Provide documentation and support to the Government for the DoD Information Technology Security Certification & Accreditation Process (DITCAP).

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the requirements stated above.  Firms with an existing driving training device or with the capability to provide a driving training device with those capabilities shall provide the following information, on electronic media compatible with MS Office 2000:

1. A description (and picture if available) of the driving training device.  Include as a minimum the maximum weight, height, lift, packaging and transportability requirements.

2. Describe how the firms driving training device meets the requirements discussed above and propose a delivery schedule.

3. Information on the capability for the system to be deployed and the capability of operating in remote and austere locations on a stand alone configuration. 

4. Information on existing and/or proposed hardware drawings of the device and software block diagrams.  Describe the proposed deliverables for drawings, documentation format and content, to include but no limited to modified COTS, support package, and software source code.

5. Information on the COTS and/or GFE utilized in the training device.

6. Provide information and explain (if applicable) how the training device will be able to reuse existing Government visual databases, training exercises, and models to conduct training.

7. Information on the Governments ability to create, modify or delete any of the developed software and/or database, include the system architecture and how it conforms with the Joint Technical Architecture - Army. 

8. Information on proprietary information and data rights (to include source code).

9. Describe the methodology to safeguard the Driver Trainer's Information system (IS) integrity and outline the process to gain an "approval to operate" (ATO) in compliance with DoDI 8500.1 IA and DoDI 5200.4 DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP).  This approval is required prior to fielding, operating the system in an exercise, or connecting to other ISs.

10. Information on compatibility of the training device with other existing Government training systems.

11. General information on the proposed spare/repair parts.

12. Information on the proposed maintenance plan for this training device to include but not limited to the ability to provide maintenance/supply support, facilities, repairs expected turn around time and any special tools or test equipment required (if any).

13. Information on any training and training support package.

14. Identify the firms history, experience, qualifications, capabilities, and military skill-based knowledge on training systems (to include driver trainers).

15. Identify the Program Management strategy planned to use by the firm for this contract.  Include list of potential sub-contractors and/or team members.

16. State if your firm has a driver trainer that the Government could view.  Identify dates for the government to have a demonstration of the training device.

17. Identify if the training device had been procured by any other Government agency, if so, please provide a contract number and POCs name and phone number.
	
The Governments intention is to determine if any existing driver training devices are already developed or if there is a possibility to (in a short period of time) develop a system that will meet the capabilities listed above.  This information will help the Program Manager determine the acquisition strategy for this program.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks support to perform advanced terrorist threat analysis (TTA) of TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary.  The analysis should be able to confirm an individuals identity using public records data, and use that confirmed identity to provide insight and information as to whether individuals present a potential terrorist threat or possible connections to potential terrorist threats.

This analysis will require little subjectivity: if there is a hit, e.g., someone is found to be on a list, or a connection is shown between a subject and someone on a list, that finding is flagged and analyzed immediately.  This analysis will be enhanced by the ability to confirm an individuals identity through the use of extensive and rich public records data.  This data will also be used as the input for the analysis; such extensive data can be deployed because of the relatively small size of the population to be checked (when compared to the traveling public, for example). Please email your interest to j.thompson@dhs.gov

<CONTACT>Major Orlando Dimalanta, Program Manager, Phone 801-586-0806, Fax null, Email orlando.dimalanta@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis for a safe-fuze for the BLU-97 bomblet used in the CBU-87, CBU-103, and AGM-154A combined-effects munitions.  It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of an interest in this effort by the government.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.

The primary objective of this effort is to provide a safe-fuze design for the BLU-97, which will ensure, with high confidence, any unexploded BLU-97 becomes completely inert after a specified time interval.  Improving BLU-97 reliability and/or incorporating self destruct features will improve the situation regarding UXO, but note that, regarding this effort, the primary objective is to ensure dud ordnance left on the battlefield is always rendered safe with high reliability.  An effective safing mechanism would leave zero lethal bomblets on the battlefield following an engagement.  

Successful solutions will meet the following requirements:  1) Ensure, with high confidence, any unexploded BLU-97 becomes completely inert after a specified time interval; 2) Maintain existing BLU-97 performance against current target sets; 3) Be fully compatible with CBU-87, CBU-103, and AGM-154A weapon systems; 4) Be fully compliant with Navy and Air Force safety requirements for land-based, ship-based, and air-carried systems; 5) Be capable of insertion into existing BLU-97s through a modification program and; 6) Capable of incorporation into BLU-97 production; 7) Have a minimum 20-year shelf life.

Potential solutions will be evaluated for cost, schedule, performance and risk by an integrated technical and management team of government personnel.  Responses should include sufficient technical detail and proposed design validation methodology to permit an independent government assessment of technical risk.  Respondents are encouraged to provide a risk assessment for their proposed solutions.  Proprietary information will be protected by the government.  The POC for this effort is Major Orlando Dimalanta, 801-586-0806.  Send responses to:  Maj Orlando Dimalanta, Bldg 1257, 6034 Dogwood Avenue, Hill AFB, UT 84056.  The requested information is due to the Air Force POC by close of business, December 1, 2003.  All sources, domestic foreign, are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to establish a Clinical Network for the Development of Treatments for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS) which will consist of ten Clinical Care Treatment Groups (CCTGs), which may include international sites, and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC). The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical studies under multiple protocols for the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS. The CCTGs, consisting of one or more participating intensive care units, are expected to enroll a total of 300 subjects per year for five years.  The NHLBI intends to release separate Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the CCTG and the CCC to coordinate all aspects of the research and to manage and analyze the patient and research data.  The CCC will participate in a cooperative effort with the CCTGs and a representative of the NHLBI to form a Steering Committee that serves as the governing body of the Network.  The Principal Investigator (PI) of each CCTG and the CCC will be voting members of the Steering Committee.  The CCC will have a key role in study design, oversight and monitoring, data collection, data integrity, reporting and Network functioning.  The CCC will prepare confidential reports and analyses for NHLBI review committees including a Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). 

Personnel should be knowledgeable and experienced in biostatistics and the conduct of clinical trials in critically ill patients.  The PI(s) of the CCC will provide leadership in statistical issues including the design of study protocols and analysis of study data.  The CCC will be responsible for the design or selection, and management of data collection tools and ensuring quality control. The CCC will include personnel experienced in pulmonary and critical care medicine.  

The CCC will develop plans for randomization of patients, data collection and analysis, monitoring of data, reporting of data to the DSMB, and analysis of manuscripts for peer review.
 
The CCC will coordinate pre-testing of data collection systems and have responsibility for reproduction and dissemination of protocols, manuals and forms.  It will also coordinate training of CCC and CCTG staff in implementing protocols and entering data. The CCC should be experienced in dealing with the Food and Drug Administration in obtaining approvals for new drugs and/or devices.  The CCC will be responsible for arranging for drug blinding and drug distribution as necessary.  The CCC will monitor data for accuracy and completeness, and will establish a mechanism for on-site monitoring of patient records by a clinical nurse in order to validate data entry.  The CCC will be responsible for maintaining confidentiality of data and for monitoring development of informed consent forms.

The CCC will be responsible for coordinating communications among CCTGs and scheduling conference calls and meetings of study committees as needed. The CCC will also organize meetings of the DSMB and PRC, and prepare statistical reports and minutes of these meetings. The PI(s) of the CCC will attend DSMB meetings to present data.

Data collection is expected to involve the most modern techniques available that can be supported in intensive care units.  A central data collection system that allows periodic download of data from remote sites is preferred.  The CCC will need personnel knowledgeable in the design and uses of decision support tools and familiar with bedside data collection systems.  The data collected should be in a format that allows easy uploading of data from CCTGs to the CCC via the internet. The CCC should be familiar with automatic downloading of data from laboratory systems. Although not required at this time, the CCC will be required to develop an automated information systems security plan prior to contract award.  

This announcement is a market survey to assess the availability and technical capability of small businesses as defined by NAICS code 541710 for research and development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences.  The appropriate size standard is 500 employees. Small business firms having demonstrated experience in meeting the requirements described above are invited to submit capability statements in original and two copies.

<DESC>The Combatant Craft Program Office is conducting market research to obtain information concerning a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system for use on military marine Combatant Craft.   Craft lengths are from 28 feet to 50 feet and their operating speeds are from 10-50 knots in up to sea state 4.  Typical shock profiles that the craft experience in all 3 axes are shown in the graph below, repeated every five seconds.  Note: if the graph is not displayed, it can be approximated by the following function:
0(is less than)t(is less than).1s | acceleration data = 110t, .1s(is less than)t(is less than) .7s | acceleration data = 11exp (-9(t-.1)).  The data can be obtained from point of contact listed below.  

-	The primary mission of the FLIR system is to provide craft operators with a day and night, high resolution, infrared imaging capability to augment existing optical and radar sensors.  
  
The government desires a system that meets or is capable of being modified to meet the following requirements.
-	Stabilized Gimbal that provides 360 degrees of continuous track capability starting from any azimuth.
-	Elevation coverage would be -10 degrees to +120 degrees whether gimbal up or down. 
-	All Lowest Replaceable Units (LRUs) should survive -40 degrees to +160 degrees in storage environment and should be able to operate in -40 degrees to +130 degrees air environment.  The high temperature extremes should take into account thermal loading.   
-	Track a single target
-	Operate from 24 VDC unregulated boat power and have low current draw. 
-	Stabilized gimbal weight shall be no more than 35 pounds
-	Total system weight, including cables, shall be a maximum of 60 pounds
-	Integrate on to craft without major modifications
-	Output video and symbols in an SVGA resolution (objective) format with a threshold of NTSC resolution format that will be used to display on the crafts existing hardware and for video capture.  
-	The system will preferably have more than one video output for simultaneous viewing and video capture.  (Threshold 2, Objective 4 video outputs.)    
-	Support individual sensors, or be coupled with multiple sensors.  It is imperative that electronic interfaces are available in a standard commercial format.  (Threshold)   For example, the system can be tied to a GPS and compass so a NMEA interface would be required.  RS422 and /or RS232 interfaces are requirements for interfacing to a weapons system.   
-	At a minimum, be able to operate in a high shock environment with typical acceleration data in all 3 axis as displayed in the graph.  (Threshold)  Peaks of 20gs have been experienced with the same curve characteristics.  
-	FLIR solution should include thermal imaging capability, laser range finder, and day camera (low light TV/CCD) capabilities. The Laser Range Finder (Objective) shall be non-detectable to outside the craft when fired. 
-	Have a system display shall be capable of use with Night Vision Goggles and be direct sunlight readable.  
-	The FLIR systems components exterior surfaces shall have low reflectivity including the optical components.  
-	System shall have no light emissions from backlight controls.   
-	All system Lowest Replaceable Units (LRUs) shall be easily connected and disconnected from each other in less than 10 minutes.
-	The system will be designed not to increase the thermal signature of the craft if not utilizing a heating circuit.  
-	System audible noise shall be no louder than normal speech.
-	The FLIR system shall have a zoom or extender feature.  
-	All cables, connectors and mounting provisions shall have quick disconnects, be environmentally sealed, and non-corrosive in a marine environment.    All system components (particularly the optics)  shall be treated/coated to protect against harsh marine environments (salt fog and occasional saltwater splashing) as well as driven sand.  
-	The system should be designed to offset convergence effects in the maritime environment. 
-	System LRU reliability shall be a minimum of 300 hours Mean Time Between Failures (Threshold) in the intended operating environment. 
-	Control of the system sensors shall be done from a hand controller with the intent to migrate to an integrated bridge controller.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Electronic Mall (DOD EMALL) Team is submitting the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding Custom Pack and Ship (CPAS) services.  The objective of the DOD EMALL evaluation will be to assess proposed services that manage the transportation movement in support of OCONUS customer shipments and consolidation of CONUS orders into single shipments.  The proposal should address the five focus areas:  1) receiving; 2) cross-docking; 3) short term storage; 4) pick and packing; and 5) shipping.  The CPAS should allow the OCONUS and CONUS DOD EMALL customer to receive items purchased in a shopping cart in a single shipment.  Responses should: contain a catalog that describes the services offered; support the customer in requesting a CPAS price for a specified set of services for a specific set of items in a shopping cart; allow collaboratively priced services; report status on the shopping cart once per day after the first item is received at the CPAS suppliers location; and provide in-transit visibility.  Customers will review the proposed shipping costs based on destination and weight and optional special packing requirements and elect to accept or reject the proposed shipping arrangements.  The proposed price will become a line item in the shopping cart in cases where the customer accepts the proposal.  The DOD EMALL is interested in finding Carriers or VENDORS of commercial transportation tools or technologies, who are experienced in the movement of commercial goods to government customers in OCONUS and are willing to consolidate CONUS shipments.  Based upon the responses to this RFI, the DOD EMALL Team will select the appropriate vendors for assessment.  If you or your organization is involved in the area of distribution within OCONUS and consolidation of CONUS shipments, please refer to the procurement and contracts web site listed below.  Further information concerning the details of DOD EMALL can be found on the DOD EMALL website, http://www.emall.dla.mil.  Request interested parties submit a capabilities statement not to exceed 20 pages, single-spaced to Ms. Brenda Geist (Brenda.geist@dla.mil) no later than 2:00 p.m., 8 Dec 2003.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks support to perform advanced terrorist threat analysis (TTA) of TSA job candidates and employees, and other persons as necessary.  The analysis should be able to confirm an individuals identity using public records data, and use that confirmed identity to provide insight and information as to whether individuals present a potential terrorist threat or possible connections to potential terrorist threats.

This analysis will require little subjectivity: if there is a hit, e.g., someone is found to be on a list, or a connection is shown between a subject and someone on a list, that finding is flagged and analyzed immediately.  This analysis will be enhanced by the ability to confirm an individuals identity through the use of extensive and rich public records data.  This data will also be used as the input for the analysis; such extensive data can be deployed because of the relatively small size of the population to be checked (when compared to the traveling public, for example). Please email your interest to j.thompson@dhs.com

Contractors must have the capability to collect airborne hyperspectral sensor imagery with existing assets on a contractor furnished airframe, and have the technical personnel and lab capability to further develop and modify sensors as described below.  The goal of this research and development effort is to test and assess hyperspectral sensor technologies and algorithms which provide phenomenology and signature exploitation for detection of surface-laid and recently-buried metal and plastic antitank landmines from an airborne platform.  The general approach is to perform airborne data collections over multiple government-supplied test sites to develop a landmine signature database, perform analysis on these and other hyperspectral bot h for sensor evaluation and to design optimized algorithms for mine detection and clutter rejection, provide georegistered imagery and detection statistics to the government for analysis and scoring, evaluate and modify sensor designs based on test results .  Ultimately the goal is to provide recommended sensor design specifications and optimized mine/clutter detection algorithms to the follow-on 6.3 effort.  The Government considers this to be a 24-month effort, to start in 2QFY04 (subject to availability o f funds).  Performance Objectives:  Sensor spectral ranges: 400-2300 nm preferred, 400-800 nm necessary for VNIR sensor, 8-11 um for LWIR sensor; capability to add color linescanner boresighted with other sensors; VNIR/SWIR sensor spectral resolution less than or equal to 10 nm; LWIR sensor spectral resolution less than or equal to 75 nm; number of spectral bands greater than or equal to 40; platform altitude greater than or equal to 1,000 feet; pixel resolution on ground less than or equal to 5Ã¢ÂÂ; swat h width on ground greater than 200 feet; georeference image pixel location error less than or equal to 3 meter. Technical Thrusts:  (a) Airborne data collections with currently existing hyperspectral (LWIR, VNIR/SWIR) and active airborne imaging sensors. The system must currently be capable of collecting VNIR hyperspectral data (400-800 nm), with capability to extend to the SWIR (400-2300 nm) (b) Also capable to perform airborne data collections with LWIR hyperspectral (8-12 um) and a VNIR/SWIR active imag ing sensor (c) Signal processing and automatic target detection for landmine signature characterization and phenomenology understanding; must develop capability for sub-pixel target detection, (d) Modifications to existing sensor hardware as government det ermines from results of processing test imagery.  Tests and Demonstrations:  During this 24 month effort the contractor shall pursue the technical objectives listed above.  In this effort the contractor shall demonstrate the specified performance of the ai rborne sensor testbed in the laboratory prior to the field demonstration.  In the field, the testbed shall be capable of collecting the airborne hyperspectral imagery with associated georeference data using a differential Global Positioning System.  The co ntractor shall perform field tests over Government chosen test sites and collect data over Government-furnished foreign and US antitank landmines with fuzes removed.   The first test shall be conducted no later than 6 months after the contract start date.  The contractor must make arrangements for installing the sensor and obtaining airworthiness for the hardware on the airborne platform.  In following years, 1-2  tests shall be performed per year, including Ã¢ÂÂblindÃ¢ÂÂ target areas at each test site.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  Contractors who can satisfy the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs requirements are urged to provide by close of business 21 November 2003,  documentation supporting the claim that the contractor presently has the capabilities to perform the required work.  This documentation should include resumes of the contractorÃ¢ÂÂs relevant technical and management personnel, a detailed description of the contractorÃ¢ÂÂs experience in development of hyperspectral sensor and algorithm technology for landmine detection, and other evidence supporting the claim.  The Government will consider all responses submitted on time.  The contractor shall be respon sible for any costs associated with preparing responses.  A response shall be no longer than twenty (20) pages, excluding resumes.  All responses shall be prepared in MS Word and submitted to the CECOM Acquisition Center-Washington Contracting Officer via email at peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil.Tests and Demonstrations:  During this 24 month effort the contractor shall pursue the technical objectives listed above.

<SUBJECT>22 -- ATIP Industry Day Announcement and RFI
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT and REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is conducting market research that will assist in the development of an acquisition strategy for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of FRAs fleet of Track Geometry cars assigned to FRAs Automated Track Inspection Program (ATIP), as well as two Research and Development (R&D) cars.  This Request for Information (RFI) concerns the FRAs plans for a 7-year contract to include the design and construction of two new Government-owned high-speed track geometry cars (T-19 self-propelled, and an option for T-20 towed) deliverable in 2006 and 2007 respectively, followed by the eventual operation and maintenance of FRAs entire fleet of high-speed, railbound, track geometry cars.  The fleet currently consists of two cars manufactured by Plasser and a refurbished Metroliner car manufactured by Budd.  A general description of the ATIP can be found on the FRA website at http://www.atipsafety.com/real_index.html.  FRA is contemplating a solicitation for the acquisition of two new cars (T-19 and T-20) for the ATIP having the following general specifications:  

T-19  Self-Propelled (1 car consist capable of operating speeds up to 90 mph), Association of American Railroads (AAR) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 49 compliant (including Tier I), Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS), Track Data Management  System (TDMS), Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS).

T-20 (optional) Towed (1 or 2 car consist capable of operating speeds up to 150 mph), Association of American Railroads (AAR) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 49 compliant (including Tier I), Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS), Track Data Management  System (TDMS), Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS).

The solicitation may include the follow-on operation and maintenance services for FRAs current ATIP geometry car, designated T-2000 (T-17) about January 2005, and FRAs existing Research and Development (R&D) cars T-16 (track geometry car) and T-18 (Gage Restraint Measurement System car).    ENSCO, Inc. of Springfield, Virginia is the current contractor providing operation and maintenance for the FRAs T-2000 and T-16 cars.  The current contract requires approximately 32,610 person hours annually on a 13-hour day shift basis.  Historically the acquisition cost of FRAs new cars has been approximately $4 million dollars, with the current operation and maintenance costing approximately $3.2 million per car annually.   

The purpose of this RFI is to request industry comments, expressions of interest, and statements of capabilities applicable to the supply of the two new cars starting in 2004, as well as the continued operation and maintenance of the growing FRA fleet starting in 2005.  FRA anticipates a firm-fixed-price contract for the fabrication/supply of the two new cars, with the subsequent operation and maintenance to be performed on a cost-reimbursement basis during a potential total period of performance of seven (7) years including options.   

Furthermore, FRA will host an Industry Day on Wednesday, December 3, 2003 at FRAs Washington, DC headquarters for interested potential respondents.  Industry sources may meet individually in a session of up to 90 minutes with FRA technical representatives and contracting staff for informal, unclassified information exchanges related to the acquisition strategy being planned for the anticipated Request for Proposal to be issued at a later date.  To register for the Industry Day participation and schedule your discussion session, please e-mail Mr. Robert Carpenter at Robert.Carpenter@fra.dot.gov.   Interested parties must provide by e-mail a written, general statement of capabilities, your company name, the names of planned attendees (up to four), and the name, e-mail address and telephone number of your point of contact for this event for which your participation must be confirmed in advance no later than Wednesday, November 19, 2003.     

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  The Government does not intend to pay for travel costs or any information received in response to this RFI.

<SUBJECT>INTEGRATED ARCHITECTURE BEHAVIOR MODEL (IABM) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION BY  JOINT SINGLE INTEGRATED AIR PICTURE (SIAP) SYSTEM ENGINEERING OFFICE (JSSEO)
<DESC>Document Type:		Request for Information 	Solicitation Number:N00024-04-R-5102 	Posted Date:01 November 2003 	Original Request Date:	01 November 2003 	Original Archive Date:	 	Current Archive Date: 	Classification code:A-Research and Development ************************************************************ Points of Contact JSSEO Technical: CDR James Stein (703) 602-6443; james.stein@siap.pentagon.mil; NAVSEA Contracts: LCDR Kristin Acquavella (202) 781-4175; acquavellak@navsea.navy.mil ************************************************************ A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) RELEVANT TO RAPID INNOVATION ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION, INTEGRATION, AND FIELDING OF JOINT TACTICAL BATTLE MANAGEMENT AND COMMAND AND CONTROL (BMC2) FUNCTIONALITY FOR AEROSPACE WARFARE: Overview: The Joint Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) System Engineering Organization (JSSEO) announces it s process for fostering innovation in the development of the SIAP Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM). The IABM is an automated specification, in the form of a computer program written in executable UML®, using the Object Management Group's (OMG®) Model Driven Architecture (MDA®) . The IABM, when integrated in elements of the Department of Defense (DoD) joint tactical integrated air and missile defense portfolio, will improve critical combat capabilities by:  · reducing the risk of fratricide; · opening up the battle space to employ weapons to their designed kinematic range; and · supporting the capability to counter emerging threats Application computer programs that develop a mutually consistent distributed database within a distributed, peer-to-peer network will improve tactical battle management and command and control for the aerospace warfare mission area.  The Government has determined that the MDA® approach produces a clear description of the behavior of individual peers in the peer-to-peer network, while facilitating effective communications with industry partners. Furthermore, the model-driven design of the IABM:  ·  enables JSSEO to take  adopt innovative concepts and algorithms, facilitated by a modular, open system design; · supports formal  processes to  evaluate the completeness and correctness of the iteratively developed IABM; and, · facilitates  continuous and systematic  testing of the IABM in the Joint Distributed Engineering Plant (JDEP) technical framework environment. To be successful, the IABM must take advantage of innovative concepts and algorithms that industry, academia, and government  will share in a collaborative environment. The ability of the Government and industry partners to  share and adapt in novative ideas provides a "best of breed" solution meeting near-term military needs and aligned with longer-term SIAP requirements and objectives. A collaborative approach further serves to enhance modular design, reduce time to field, and encourages early identification and  adoption of the most innovative concepts and algorithms to improve joint warfighting capabilities. Process:  Operational requirements for the SIAP capability are based on the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated Capstone Requirements Documents (i.e., Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD), Combat Identification (CID), and Global Information Grid (GIG)).  Additional requirements sources include:  · Operational Requirements Documents (ORD), Capability Development Documents (CDD), and Capability Production Documents (CPD) from the SIAP Partner Program Offices (e.g., AWACS, Patriot, E_2C,  AEGIS); · Service Concepts of Link Employment (COLE); · The Operational Views of the TAMD Integrated Architecture; and, · DoD and Joint Staff directives and instructions. The JSSEO is working with the military services to develop operational threads (e.g., Targeting, Passive Defense/Early Warning, Integrated Combat Airspace Command and Control) that give the requirements an operational context within which to identify SIAP-relevant operational nodes, activities and data elements that can be traced back to the top-level operational requirements.  These operational threads are used to update Operational Views (OV) constructed using the DoD Architecture Framework (DoD AF) as format guidance.  The operational requirements are allocated to operational elements, such as operational nodes, activities, or data exchanges within these views.  The  OV's and the operational requireme nts trace will continue to be approved incrementally using established DoD processes.    The IABM will be developed at two functional levels: a design for the distributed system and a design for the individual Peer Computing Program (PCP), the computer program that when implemented in Service systems provides the SIAP capability.  System level requirements will be developed for the distributed system, and a correlation will be made between operational requirements and distributed system requirements.  Distributed system requirements will be allocated to various system elements or functions. This will yield a requirements-based OV-to-System View (SV) mapping process. System requirements for the PCP will be derived to satisfy the set of distributed system requirements.  There will also be several technical system requirements added to the IABM development process, including: · Joint Technical Architecture (see JTA, Version 5.0 dtd 4 Apr 03, at http://www-jta.itsi.disa.mil/); · Link-16 Single Link Interface Requirements Specification (SLIRS); · IABM functional baseline, functional architecture, and object model; · Global Information Grid (GIG) and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Technical Standards; and, · SIAP Partner system requirements and specifications. The Government will use an automated toolset to maintain traceability between the architecture products and their allocated requirements, thus enabling export of system level requirements into the IABM computer program development environment for allocation to specific classes. The IABM will be developed using an iterative "spiral" type development process to enable the Government and industry partners to continuously develop and adapt the IABM to meet evolving military operatio nal and system needs. Incorporating lessons learned from the Navy's undersea warfare domain experience, four dominant management principles will guide development of the IABM: q Collaboration. To encourage innovation within a fair and objective framework, the JSSEO opens participation in the IABM development process to all potential contributors (with appropriate national security caveats). The JSSEO will fully disclose the emerging IABM baseline, enabling potential contributors to compare and contrast their ideas in the context of a complete, distributed system.  q Peer Review. The JSSEO will use Government-led peer review groups composed of nationally recognized authorities with the most relevant technical expertise's. These groups actively seek the best algorithms and methods from industry, academia, and Government sources. The peer review groups will objectivel y evaluate potential contributions, providing information and recommendations to the Government lead to select the best alternatives.  The peer review groups will assess products against near and longer-term SIAP and IABM requirements and development objectives. q Build-Test-Build/Operational Feedback. Warfighter/user review and feedback concerning the IABM is fundamental to development and fielding of an operationally suitable and operationally effective joint BMC2 capability.  Operational feedback is established by  several means, including analysis of Joint warfighter needs (e.g., TAMD CRD, CID CRD, GIG CRD, and Unified Joint Task List (UTJL)/Join Mission Essential Task Lists (JMETL)), after-action reports of military operations, training exercises and evaluations, and lessons-learned knowledge bases.  Additionally, with the use of an operationally realistic test environm ent and a flexible computer model of the JTAMD Architecture, JSSEO JTAMD system performance can be benchmarked.  To achieve and ensure consistency for each evaluation means, a Joint, community-approved, Defense Planning Guidance (DPG)-based operational context is required.  Common Reference Scenarios (CRS's) provide this common operational environment and establish the baseline of system performance from the engineering level to the military utility level.  The common operational context provides sufficient detail to support integrated air warfare M&S, Hardware In the Loops (HWIL) exercises, Operator In The Loop (OITL) exercises, and Live exercises.  CRS development relies upon subject matter experts to represent the interests of individual service and agency initiatives and programs and an active process to authoritatively define operational architectures and requirements from  the standpoint of joint operations. q Reduced Implementation Time. After initial deployment, the JSSEO will deliver to integrating system program managers an updated, improved-capability, configuration-controlled IABM every twenty-four (24) months. Rapid delivery of updated versions of the IABM ensures that the IABM will maintain technology currency and disciplined innovation insertion.  Current Schedule:  The current JSSEO schedule calls for design and engineering activities in FY04 to support a September 2005 release of  IABM Configuration 05, with  subsequent IABM releases approximately every 24 months. Key capabilities for Configuration 05  are the Track Management, Combat Identification, and Distributed Resource Management domains.

<OFFADD>US Army Engineer District, New York, CENAN-CT, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY  10278-0090
<SUBJECT>--The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District has a need for a brand name only equipment for a fire alarm radio transceivers.
<DESC>NA The New York District intends to solicit and award two construction projects for Fort Drum, NY, entitled Wheeler Sack Army Airfield Barracks Complex and First Brigade Barracks Complex. The projects themselves will be solicited competitively under future so licitations.  These projects include a Brand Name Only component.  This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to notify potential offerors of the Armys intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project and (2) to identify  potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the Armys intent to sole source a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monoco system is embedded in the Construction projects, which projects will be i ssued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco system is sole source if no sources are able to provide a compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to  FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.   The synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the governments intent.   SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The project includes Brand Name only equipment for building fire alarm radio transceivers manufactured by Monaco Enterprises.     These projects with their many state-of-the-art building components require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best and the most eco nomical alternative to be compatible with the existing system.  Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-700 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  These projects include multiple buildings with varying requirements.  Since multiple transceivers will be requir ed, two models have been determined to be acceptable, and the appropriate model will be selected per individual building requirements.  The Monaco Enterprises Inc. BT2-7 Building Transceiver, and BT2-8 Building Transceiver are the equipment best suited to meet the needs of Fort Drum. The BT2-7 and BT2-8 Fire Alarm Building Transceivers are functionally designed for specific Government fire department operations.  Monaco Enterprise Inc. provides 24/7 technical support and in-service training of Installation personnel for operation and m aintenance inclusive.  It is paramount that this system be carefully coordinated to maintain overall system integrity and capabilities. The required features of the BT2-7 and BT2-8 Fire Alarm Building Transceivers are as follows: -Integrated Radio transmission of alarms, troubles, and restorations for up to 16 (BT2-7) or 32 (BT2-8) zones -Output RF power 4 watts minimum -Narrowband radio transmission -BT2 address is set by DIP or rotary switches; zone identification numbers only needed to be entered at the D-700. -Communication with the D-700 is supervised and status changes are reported by automatic and manual poll/reply/acknowledge routines. -Battery fault (low or disconnected battery or abnormal charger output), ac fail conditions and restorations reported with the BT2 number; ac fail reporting may be inhibited. -LEDs identify BT2 and zone status; detectable audible alert sounds for alarms and troubles. -Zone inputs may be disabled at the D-700 -Programmed diagnostic tests -Integral battery disconnect circuitry prevents battery damage due to prolonged discharge. -Automatic transmitter disconnect for Ã¢ÂÂstuckÃ¢ÂÂ transmitter -Integral battery backup and charging circuitry for 60 hours continuous operation. -Current status is stored in nonvolatile, transferable Data Module Any vendor wishing to provide a system that is compatible with the existing Monaco system must provide a copy of its brochure and any other data by 18 Nov 03 to Shaukat Syed, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York Distri ct, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, N.Y., New York 10278. This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date.
