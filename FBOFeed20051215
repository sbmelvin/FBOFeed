<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is CT1745-05 and is issued as a Request For Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.   This requirement is a 100% set aside exclusively for small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 333298 and small business size standard is 500.   UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., intends to enter into a firm-fixed price definite delivery/definite quantity type contract for various equipment. The period of performance for this requirement is 120 days.  Delivery is required 60 days after receipt of delivery order.

THE QUANTITY AND LINE ITEM DESCRIPTIONS ARE STATED IN SECTION B OF THE SOLICITATION.  (REFER TO SECTION B OF THE SOLICITATION)


Machines are to be set up, sewn off, and tested prior to shipping.  All machines shall be complete with table, motor & stand.  Packaging of all machines should be, at a minimum, screwed/strapped down to the shipping pallet and shrink wrapped.  Each machine shall include a sew-off sample to be evaluated upon delivery of the machine.

THIS REQUIREMENT MAY RESULT IN A MULTIPLE AWARD.  THIS IS A BRAND NAME OR EQUAL REQUIREMENT.

The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition:

52.204-6, Contractor Identification Number Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS);
	
52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration;

52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal;
     	
52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial;

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, Significant evaluation factors are past performance, ability to conform to the specifications, and price.  Past performance is significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government may make award without discussions - therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain offeror's best pricing.   Tradeoff Process: It may be in the Government's best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal if the perceived benefits of the highest priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.;

52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Representations and certifications by logging onto  http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process.   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

The purpose of the upgrade is to have the hardware EMI/EMC/environmentally tested and qualified, AIMS Certified, and integrated with stand-alone/applique crypto at the "box level".  The upgrade will make the existing AN/APX-103C AWACS Interrogator more "production ready" by building two (2) AN/UPX-40 pre-production units, getting them "qualified" at the "box level", AIMS certified, integrated with CRYPTO devices, and environmentally tested (EMI/EMC, temperature, etc).  There are no test flights or aircraft tests, flight or ground, associated with this effort and the period of performance will be from approximately March 2006 through September 2007.<br> <br>      The Government intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract only to the Telephonics Corporation of Farmingdale, NY under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Under a previous contract, they added a Mode 5/S interrogation and reply processing capability to the IFF Bench Test Simulator, used to run acceptance test procedures, and developed a protype interrogator compatible with the existing AWACS System. <br> <br>      The purpose of this RFI is to identify any interested and qualified sources capable to perform the above efforts.  In order to be considered for this effort, a potential contractor must have familiarity with the AWACS IFF Interrogator System(AN/APX-103C0 and its Mission System interface and specification requirements in the E-3 aircraft, its operation(hardware and software) and the AWACS mission system unique interfaces.  The effort involved is to upgrade this system while maintaining the form, fit, and increased function compatibilities with existing and future E-3(Blocks 30/35 and 40/45)aircraft.  Experience with the NATO AWACS Mode S Interrogator Flight Test Program is highly desirable. <br> <br>      Interested parties who meet the above  criteria and want to be considered, should provide all relevent information on their capability to accomplish this effort.  Please supply this information, electronically, NLT 10JAN2006 to Captain Jorge Manresa at jorge.manresa@hanscom.af.mil. Please indicate if you are US or foreign owned and if you are a large or small business. <br> <br>      The Government will evaluate all responses objectively, however a determination not to compete this effort, based upon responses received, is at the sole discretion of the Government.  The information received will be used to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br> <br>      THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. IT IS NOT A RFP OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL SOLICITATION.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT IS SUBMITTED.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>CONTACT Mike Nicolich, System Engineer, 732-532-7309. The Department of Army is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to provide upgrade kits to modify fielded EHF (Extremely High Frequency) SMART-Ts (Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliabl e Tactical-Terminals) to provide Advanced Extremely High Frequency(AEHF) capability. The Government anticipates requirements for approximately 325 kits that may be procured during FY07 thru FY 09.The upgrade kits must be deployable and implemented at user sites worldwide with no or minimal impact to current operations. The upgraded SMART-T will retain compliance with MIL-STD-1582D (SECRET NOFORN) and MIL-STD-188-136(SECRET NOFORN) and must be compliant with all AEHF terminal specifications including MIL-STD -3015 (SECRET NOFORN). The Government does not have full disclosure rights to the SMART-T terminal drawing package, therefore, the prospective contractor will need to obtain rights to the SMART-T drawing package from Raytheon Company, 1001 Boston Post Rd, Marlborough, Ma, the developer and manufacturer of the SMART-T. We request that sources capable of meeting the Government's technical requirements provide information about its products and their ability to produce the AEHF SMART-T upgrade kits. Interested  sources should submit a white paper detailing how they can obtain or built a baseline SMART-T terminal and how the upgrade kit will be designed and implemented. All information should be submitted no later than 13 January 2006.  We request that all inform ation be sent to PM WIN-T, ATTN:  SFAE-C3T-WIN-ESS (Mike Nicolich), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5508, telephone 732-532-7309 or via email to Michael.Nicolich@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) has a requirement for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate and award a purchase order to an organization to host, plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program.  The materials developed and example set by the first annual Community Genetics Forum (see http://www.genome.gov/14514654) held in the spring of 2005, in conjunction with the University of Washington,  should be used to learn from the experience.  It is expected that the public forum will be held in the Spring or early Fall of 2006.  The overall goal of the project is to improve upon the existing model and make it community specific.   It is a further goal to develop and evaluate supportive materials for the community that can be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genetics forum with community engagement in their respective communities.  NIH is contributing with the International Human Genome Project.  This project was successfully completed in April 2003 and now the NHGRI has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease.  To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health.  A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.  The Statement of Work for this service is as follows: Background of the Project: In the spring of 2005, the Education and Community Involvement Branch (ECIB) at NIH, in conjunction with the University of Washington, held the first annual Community Genetics Forum.  The goals of this Forum were: 1) to engage the Northwest communities in dialogue about genetics and the ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research (ELSI); 2) to create a forum and environment for future dialogue independent of federal sponsorship; and 3) to create a model program and supportive materials that would be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genetics forum with community outreach in their respective communities. ECIB plans to use this model to support the development of future annual Community Genetics Forums.  Geographic Region:  In an effort to reach different geographic areas of the country NHGRI has selected DHHS regions IV and VI as appropriate locations for the next Forum.  An objective of the Forum is to extend beyond the immediate geographic reach of the NIH. This region is defined to include  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.   Objectives for project:  The objectives of the public genetics forum with community outreach include: 1) To increase awareness, interest and understanding of the field of genetics, genomics, and the ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research.  2) To increase awareness of the current research and scientific advances. 3) To increase awareness of the career options in genomics, genetics and ELSI research.  4) To increase awareness and understanding of the implications of genomic science on medicine and society.  5) To engage community groups to facilitate a dialogue to identify questions, concerns and education needs related to genomics.  6) To facilitate a reciprocal relationship between the community and the specified organization.  7)  To involve a target audience inclusive of minorities and special populations.  8) To facilitate the establishment of ongoing community relationships that continue beyond the forum itself.  9)  To collaborate with NHGRI in the final Forum program development.  Scope of Project:  The selected organization will host, plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a genetics public forum with community outreach.  In doing such, a product will be created that can be reproduced and distributed to assist other individuals in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of other genetics public symposia with community outreach in their respective communities.  This product will build upon a previously existing model, created after the first Community Genetics Forum held in 2005. 
Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the selected organization (referred to as Contractor) will furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the specific tasks delineated below.  Tasks Required of Project:  Task 1: Planning  The Contractor will prepare a document that will be based on the Contractor’s proposal and this Statement of Work (SOW) and will include activity timeliness, as appropriate, and the following information: 1) Proposed objectives, goals, and topics for the public forum.  2) Proposed draft agenda for the public forum. 3)  Description of community outreach goals and objectives.  4) Description of the proposed community outreach activities. 5)  Description of the target audience(s) for the public forum.  6)  Potential project partners and the role(s) of each partner.  7)  Potential locations for the public forum and maximum audience capacity. 8) Description of target community(ies).  9)  Description of the proposed advertising or marketing activities for the public forum.  10)  Description of an evaluation plan for the community outreach activities and the forum, including the goals and objectives to be measured, how they will be measured, and data collection, compilation, analyses and reporting activities to be conducted.  11)  Description and outline of the product to be developed that will describe the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of the public forum with community outreach.  12)  Description of the plan to continue community engagement and collaboration beyond the Forum.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has a requirement to accelerate neuroprotective therapeutics development for Parkinson’s Disease (PD).  PD is the second most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disease, hallmarked by the gradual loss of dopaminergic and other neurons, as well as the accumulation of insoluble aggregates.  Therefore, a primary goal is to find rational treatments which can prevent progression of the disease once diagnosed or prevent neurons from dying in individuals at risk for developing  the disease.  In 2001, the NINDS established the Committee to Identify Neuroprotective Agents for Parkinson’s (CINAPS). CINAPS is the process whereby neuroprotective drugs and doses are selected for the Neuroprotection Exploratory Trials in Parkinson’s disease (NET-PD), which are ongoing. CINAPS has developed an evidence-based approach, which uses the published literature to select promising drugs for Parkinson’s clinical trials. This process was well received and the CINAPS results were published (Neurology 60(8):1234-40, 2003). The approach has been adopted for use by the HD and ALS research communities, at their request. While the CINAPS process is sound, the main limitation is the quality and thoroughness of the preclinical animal testing data found in the literature. When planning trials, there is often insufficient information in the published preclinical literature. The models chosen, route of administration, dose and other features may not fully answer some of the questions needed for bringing drugs into clinical trials, or there may simply be no replication of the study results demonstrating efficacy in a particular model.  Therefore, NINDS has identified a need to establish a contract facility that would provide resources and capabilities to help select the most promising drugs for PD clinical trials.  Some of the tasks involved in this project are:  1) efficacy studies; 2) toxicity studies; 3) PD Animal Model standardization; 4) CINAPS research logistics; and 5) quality control.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years beginning September, 2006.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-06-02 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26.*****

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a mobile Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) capability against potential Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats currently facing the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. These systems will emit a signal designed to block remote initiation of RCIED devices (jamming activity).

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use basic (one step/one envelope) bidding procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this RFQ will be that bid which is compliant with the technical requirements and is the lowest price offered.

The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA procedure with the additional opportunity for the Nations in response to this Notification of Intent (NOI) to nominate bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 9.3 million Euros ($11 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-11856-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The Minimum Military Requirements are to fight the threat from RC-IED establishing and maintaining a mobile ECM capability against potential RCIED threats. These systems emit a signal designed to block remote initiation of RCIED devices (jamming activity). To provide these capabilities to NATO, the following ECM systems are required:

1. VEHICULAR (Mobile): Powerful jammers that could protect an area of at least 200 m of radius. Those jammers must be installable without major refurbishments on available vehicles prepared for this purpose. They could be applied to protect convoys (20-25 vehicles), VVIPs and official ceremonies area of at least 800m x600m (simultaneous use of more than one system), without interfering with own or protected communications.

2. MAN PORTABLE: Short range very mobile jammers to be used whenever the situation does not allow for the more powerful jammers. Interference with own communications is not desirable, but of less importance that with the more powerful jammers.

The devices should be able to operate in compliance with Spectrum Management regulations, Allocation Tables and other specific documents such as the Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL) as set forth by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as well as the ISAF Theatre Frequency Management Cell (ISAF TFMC) and the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) FM organization.

For both ECM systems there should be a provision of maintenance, training, and repair by civil contractor. In case of breakdown, repair is to be accomplished by the contractor within two weeks from receipt of the unserviceable item.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET.  

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 6 January 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: January 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: 1st Quarter of 2006

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) to jointly sponsor a three day colloquium of scientific specialist entitled "Clean Water and Food: What is Acceptable Microbial Risk". The AAM has convened colloquia on issues of critical importance in microbiology for 14 years.    Each AAM colloquium brings together an invited group of scientific experts for several days of structured, directed deliberations on a specific topic.  This  colloquium will involve 25-30 scientific specialist in the areas of microbiology, biometrics, risk assessment, epidemiology, and microbial ecology, to survey the landscape of existing microbial risk assessment and, based on sound scientific principles and data, develop a direction for integrated  microbial risk assessments.  Published reports synthesize conclusions reached during these important meetings, providing analysis of the scientific issues and practical suggestions for future research.  The EPA has a strong need for objective, credible analyses, assessments, and recommendations  that will be of benefit toward improving the Agency's quantitative microbial risk assessment.  Only AAM's unique critical issue colloquium provides the environment for such comprehensive expert analysis of the state of microbial risk assessment research needs. The AAM is the honorific leadership  component of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), the world's largest single life science organization.  The AAM is composed of leading scientists in all subspecialties of microbiology elected on the basis of scientific excellence.  ASM's broad presence throughout the scientific community  and AAM's reputation for excellence, as well as their 14 year history of sponsoring significant colloquia events, give the information distributed in the published colloquia reports immediate credibility and acceptance as unbiased statements of the issues and practical recommendations for the  future.  The reports generated from this colloquium will be of interest to a diverse audience and will be disseminated widely throughout the scientific community, Federal Agencies, and educators.  The prestige of AAM's special interest colloquia and their reputation for eliciting sound and accepted  conclusions on their focused subject matter make the AAM's colloquia the sole effective forum for achieving the objectives of this proposed project. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition  Procedures. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond.  Documentation must be received by January 1, 2006 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice  is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail  growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-08-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 06 should be submitted by 12 Jan 06; FY 07 by 01 Sep 06; FY 08 by 01 Sep 07; and FY 09 by 01 Sep 08.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative solutions to address current and future Air Force net-centric interoperability requirements for maximizing the effectiveness of joint and combined military operations.

Semantic interoperability is becoming an increasingly important problem as user communities seek to interoperate within and between information spaces such as those that ride on the Global Information Grid (GIG).  Semantic interoperability is the ability of two (or more) systems (services) to exchange data on the basis of an agreed vocabulary (ontology) that guarantees the same interpretation (semantics or meaning) of notions (concepts and their interrelationships) for the users of the interoperating systems.  An ontology is a specific vocabulary and relationships used to describe certain aspects of reality, and a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of the vocabulary of words.  Ontologies are often viewed as allowing more complete and precise domain models, and the support and use of multiple, independently-developed ontologies is important for developing scalable information services which are required to support multiple Communities of Interest (COIs) and multiple producers and consumers of information.  Each year of this solicitation is focused on a specific technical area: 

FY06:  Semantic Interoperability Studies.  Information transformation is the processing of elementary forms of information into rich interoperable decision making knowledge structures for human, enterprise, and machine learning and growth.  Semantic interoperability is considered an important foundation for increasingly effective information transformation capabilities that accommodate cross-domain information sharing and understanding.  This solicitation is seeking studies of the current state of the art in semantic interoperability technologies and how these technologies might best be applied to solving military interoperability problems, where current technologies fall short in this regard, and where research investments in this area are most prudent; particularly as they apply to developing scalable information services in support of multiple Communities of Interest (COIs) with multiple producers and consumers of information.  These studies will serve as input to the semantic interoperability research and development roadmap for future years (FY07, FY08, and FY09) under this BAA.  Current speculation for out-year research in semantic interoperability is as follows, but is not cast in stone and in most likelihood will change based on the studies being sought in FY06 and the results of future research and development conducted under the auspices of this solicitation and elsewhere.

FY07:  Ontological Interoperability.  Important to information transformation is gaining an understanding of the context of an information request (e.g., so that an information system can distinguish between whether the term "Predator" refers to an unmanned aerial vehicle, an animal, or a movie).  A context contains metadata relating to its meaning, properties (such as its source, quality, and precision), and organization.  Modeling and representing context can lead to several benefits in dealing with information overload by transforming information from its source context into the context of another user or system domain.  This in turn promotes interoperability at the semantic level.  Several approaches for representing context can be found in the literature.  One suggests bringing together metadata, user profiles, information modeling abstractions, and ontologies to construct a model of the application domain and user needs.  Another proposes emergent semantics where the meaning of information is extracted from the manner in which they are used.  Many suggest using agent technology to gather context information and negotiate contexts, as well as rule-based, classification-based, pattern-based and heuristics-based methods to perform context transformation.  The primary goal is not to develop new reasoning methods and techniques, but rather to apply known approaches from the fields of knowledge representation and reasoning to provide context modeling and transformation solutions.  In FY07, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for achieving ontological mediation between different domains, vocabularies, information sources, and services.

FY08:  Dynamic Semantic Maps.  Processing an information request represented in the terms of a specific ontology in an environment with information resources that subscribe to different (but related and relevant) ontologies may involve inter-ontological relationships, such as synonym, hypernym, homonym, and other possible domain-specific relationships.  One challenge in this mediation (or reconciliation) process is how to avoid the loss of information.  Another is how to dynamically support the updating of ontologies as the semantics of data sources change.  In fact, data sources and information services may come, go and evolve over time.  Ontologies used in semantic mapping should be adequately abstracted from physically available resources to ensure that new information sources can map to the same ontology.  While ontologies are useful in semantic reconciliation and are indeed necessary for practical and performance considerations, they do not guarantee in and of themselves correct classification of semantic conflicts, nor do they provide the capability to handle evolving semantics or a mechanism to support a dynamic reconciliation process.  A challenge here is how to dynamically support the updating of inter-ontological relationships as the semantics of data sources change and/or the definition of ontologies change.  In FY08, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for dynamic transformation of semantic mappings when ontological changes are detected.

FY09:  Machine-to-Machine Interoperability.  To support machine-to-machine (M2M) interoperability, distributed access to metadata must be as seamless as access to the data itself.  To facilitate the use of distributed data sources, metadata and ontological frameworks will need to provide transparent access to all the metadata fields, including those required to operate on the data in a semantically meaningful way.  The underlying infrastructure to this framework should be modular and flexible for net-centric systems for which the technology, software and hardware change rapidly.  Data will ultimately be stored in a variety of formats.  Coupled with a flexible framework and programmatic access, semantic metadata can provide the foundation to extend the capabilities of existing distributed systems in a number of unique and powerful ways.  In FY09, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for achieving machine-to-machine interoperability with semantic meaning and information interoperability adaptors for translation between different representations of information.  While not required, of particular interest are technologies of direct applicability to tactical military operations.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the problem solution to address current and future Air Force net-centric interoperability requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which open architecture standards and technologies are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:  a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

<DESC>As authorized in 49 U.S.C. § 30168, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U. S. Department of Transportation is authorized to procure motor vehicles for research and testing purposes.  NHTSA’s Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), located in East Liberty, Ohio will competitively procure vehicles from commercial motor vehicle dealers located in reasonable proximity to the VRTC to reduce transportation/delivery charges and to expedite delivery.  Reasonable proximity will be determined on an individual requirement basis in order to  facilitate the  vehicle research and testing conducted by the VRTC.  Passenger motor vehicles through large heavy truck motor vehicles may be required and will cover VRTC’s needs through the end of FY 2006.  Because competitive procedures will be used to meet these requirements, no further synopsis for vehicles purchases over $25,000.00 will be issued.  This announcement is for information purposes only.   Commercial motor vehicle dealers wishing to be notified when a specific requirement is identified should contact Robin Esser, Contracting Officer at (937) 666-4511, ext. 213 or robin.esser@nhtsa.dot.gov.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the mission needs of the Air Force in particular the:  National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) [Produce Integrated, Predictive Air and Space Intelligence to Enable Military Operations, Force Modernization and Policymaking] and the Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC) [Information Superiority, Offensive and Defensive Counter-Information, Information Operations].  

Some general areas of interest are: modeling cognitive processes, real-time decision making, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, M&S for war-gaming/"pre-planning"/exercise rehearsal support, and specific Air and Space Systems Intelligence Mission Applications (IMA). 

Emphasis is placed on immediate technology transfer/technology insertion of “mature” (transitional) technologies (capable of being directly implemented with minimal R&D enhancement rework) into Air Force operational environments which directly support the war fighter.

THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. 

Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution. 

All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEB, ATTN: Donald J. Gondek (Reference BAA 03-12-IFKA) 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. 

The white paper will be formatted as follows: 
SECTION A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B: Task Objective; and SECTION C: Technical Summary. 

White papers must reference BAA 03-12-IFKA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria: 

(1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); 
(2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; 
(3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and 
(4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. 

Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. 

Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Selected offerors may be required to review (and store) classified material at the SECRET and SCI (Special Compartmented Intelligence) level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to SECRET and/or SCI information. 

In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA. Individual awards will not exceed 36 months in duration; total dollar amounts for all awards is approximately $4.9M.  

The estimated funding to be obligated is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.3M; FY 07 - $1.3M; FY 08 - $1.4M.   

Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. 

The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. An informational briefing is not planned.  

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

A page is defined as 8 ½ x 11 inches, single-spaced, with one-inch margins, and type not smaller than 12 points.  A smaller font is allowed for tables and figures.  Each page of the technical volume shall be counted except the following:”
 

3)  Section VII. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL PROPOSALS, A. Supplemental Proposal and Contract/Agreement Documentation, is revised to add Paragraph 9. Statement of Work as follows:

	“10.  Statement of Work.

Provide a SOW approximately 3-5 pages in length that is a separate and distinct document suitable for incorporation into the procurement instrument. Do not put proprietary data or markings in the SOW.  Format shall be as follows:

	1.0  Objective
	2.0  Scope
	3.0  Background
	4.0  Tasks/Technical Requirements    
	1st sub-level 4.1 Task
                            2nd sub-level 4.1.1 Sub-task
                            3rd sub-level 4.1.1.1 second level sub-task 
	5.0  Other to include Contract Data Requirement Lists (CDRLs) and other deliverables 
    
To assist the Government in the preparation of the contractual SOW, the offeror is required to submit a proposed SOW which accurately describes the work to be performed. The proposed SOW must contain a summary description of the technical methodology as well as the task description, but not in so much detail as to make the SOW inflexible.  

The following is offered as the format for the SOW.  

          (1)  1.0  -   Objective:  This section is intended to give a brief overview of the specialty area and should describe why it is being pursued, and what you are trying to accomplish.

          (2)  2.0  -  Scope:  This section includes a statement of what the SOW covers.  This should include the technology area to be investigated, objectives/goals, and major milestones for the effort. 

          (3)  3.0  -  Background:  The offeror shall identify appropriate documents that are applicable to the effort to be performed.  This section includes any information, explanations, or constraints that are necessary in order to understand the requirements.  It may include relationship to previous, current and future operations.  It may also include techniques previously tried and found ineffective.

          (4)  4.0  -  Tasks/Technical Requirements:

               (a)  This section contains the detailed description of tasks which represent the work to be performed which are contractually binding.  Thus, this portion of SOW should be developed in an orderly progression and in enough detail to establish the feasibility of accomplishing the overall program goals.  The work effort should be segregated into major tasks and identified in separately numbered paragraphs according to the decimal system above.  Each numbered major task should delineate, by subtask, the work to be performed.  The SOW must contain every task to be accomplished to include a schedule. 

                (b)  The tasks must be definite, realistic, and clearly stated.  Use “shall” whenever the work statement expresses a provision that is binding.  Use “should” or “may” whenever it is necessary to express a declaration of purpose.  Use “will” in cases where no offeror requirement is involved; e.g., power will be supplied by the Government.  Use active voice in describing work to be performed.

               (c)  Do not use acronyms or abbreviations without spelling-out acronyms and abbreviations at the first use; place the abbreviation in parenthesis immediately following a spelled-out phrase. 

               (d)  If presentations/meetings are identified in your schedule, include the following paragraph in your SOW:

		“Conduct presentations/meetings at times and
		 places specified in the contract schedule.”

	(5)  5.0  -  CDRLs/Other Deliverables:
		
		(a)  The CDRL serves as the contractual definition of the data item deliverables the contractor is required to generate under a contract.  The CDRL spells out the information to be contained in the data and the frequency of submission of the data.  Data requirements are not necessarily limited to technical information; they may be periodic reports such as monthly progress reports or cost reports; project or test results reports; manuals; briefings; etc.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION
Interim Capability aircraft

PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION

        The purpose of this sources sought research is to analyze industry capabilities to convert seven existing C-130H2 aircraft into an Interim Configuration (IC) of an MC-130H Combat Talon II as defined in the attached file below.  The IC capability will be similar to that of the MC-130P.  In general terms, the program’s intent is the installation of one integrated Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) which incorporates approximately twenty-five (25) smaller TCTOs.    The Government estimates this IC conversion to be an approximately 40,000 hour installation labor effort which doesn’t include Group A manufacturing labor.  The intent is to be a build to print acquisition and a data/work package will be provided for installation.  A subcontractor for engineering support services may be directed.  Equipment/systems/support equipment needed may be provided GFE.  The government will be pursuing a firm, fixed price contract for this effort.  Further clarification of the individual TCTOs and other modifications that comprise the data package will be put out on PIXIS very shortly.  Please check for updates and amendments.

----------NEW INFORMATION (12/15/05):  Due to the Pre-award Information Exchange System (PIXS) being down, we are making the additional TCTO and modification data available through email.  Please send your request to both Mr. Philip Bourgoine and Lt Victor Lewis at Philip.bourgoine@wpafb.af.mil and victor.lewis@wpafb.af.mil.----------

<DESC>14 Dec 05 UPDATE – Final RFP Released 7 Dec 05 via e-mail with 14 Dec 05 index to FBO

NOTE: The Solicitation upload on 14 Dec 05 did not show the uploaded document links, this 15 Dec upload corrects that.

1. Since approximately 26 Nov 05, the Aeronautical Systems Center PIXS server has been off-line and we have been unable to index any RFPs or other announcements to Fed Biz Opps (FBO) , the government-wide point of entry (GPE). The PIXS Server has not yet been restored and this upload is to provide the final RFP access thru FBO, the GPE.  The final RFP for the subject acquisition is available via request to the buyer or PCO below, FBO download, or PIXS download (when restored). NOTE: The XR-SIMAF draft RFP has been available to industry since early Oct 05 and we have identified thru early industry involvement over 24 potential sources. This 07 Dec RFP replaces the 23 Nov version of the draft RFP (which was loaded to PIXS/FBO on 23 Nov 05 and forwarded to all known interested sources via a PCO e-mail sent on 30 Nov 05). Now that FBO can be accessed the 07 Dec 05 RFP release is complete since the GPE transaction is now complete. Dates for proposal submission are: Past Performance volume requested on 10 Jan 06 with the Technical/Mission Capability, Cost/Price and Administrative/Contract volumes required 23 Jan 06, as specified in paragraph 3.2) below.

2. Several significant changes are reflected in the final RFP, dated 07 Dec 05. Perhaps the most significant is the deletion of all initial tasks with the exception of the $5,000 transition task. Deletion of the initial tasks has been precipitated by: a) complexities of the Sources Selection integrated assessment;  and b) the reality that the initial D Facilities O&M task was only a partial task not reflective of the entire PWS requirements for D; and c) the CWSD and Multi-Level Security initial tasks have fluid requirements that may change prior to any Apr 06 award. These three initial tasks and other possible initial tasks have been placed in the XR-SIMAF library and the AF plans to solicit many of these tasks immediately upon contract award.

3. Other important changes to the Final RFP from the 10 Nov and 23 Nov draft RFP versions are contained in the SUMMARY_RFP Changes_7 dec 05 document loaded to the library. Please NOTE that this SUMMARY of the RFP changes is not a complete list but is provided as an insight for industry in highlighting the most important RFP changes. The 7 Dec 05 RFP MUST be read in totality for the most accurate understanding of all RFP changes that have been made.
 Four of the most important RFP changes other than the deletion of the Initial Tasks discussed above are listed below:
1)	Sections L and M have been revised for clarity in many of the sub-factors to be consistent with these RFP changes (i.e. deletion of Initial tasks and solicitation of many customer funded tasks at contract award) and to require the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan. 
2)	The due dates for the Past Performance and Mission Capability/Technical and other proposal volumes have been extended nearly a week due to the PIXS server being off-line. The Past Performance volume is requested to be provided on Tuesday, 10 Jan 2006 and the Mission Capability/Technical and other proposal volumes are due on 23 Jan 2006.
3)	Transition timeline has been extended to 60 Days After Contract (DAC) since initial tasks will be solicited upon award of the new contract(s).
4)	Page counts have been revised to allow 20 pages Mission Capability per function proposed and 15 pages for Executive Summary, etc.

4. For ease of “fill-in” in any RFP proposal industry must use the separately provided Sec J Atch 7A (On-Site Burdened Labor) and 7B (Off-Site Burdened Labor) excel spreadsheets and the other Sec L attachments. The Sec J attachments which have been included in the assembled RFP to maintain the RFP structure (the ADOBE format of the RFP precludes using them as “fill-in” forms). The L-1 to L-8 documents must be downloaded from the PIXS library:
	L-1 the XR-SIMAF Teaming List
	L-2 the Past Performance Information Sheet (PPIS)
	L-3 the Performance Questionnaire Cover Letter
	l-4 the Present and Past Performance Questionnaire
	L-5 the Example Format for the Past Performance Consent Letter
	L-6 Example Format for Client Authorization Letter
	L-7 Correlation Matrix
	L-8 On-Site and Off-Site Labor Rates (See Atchs 7A and 7B in Section J of resulting contracts)

Any difficulties in accessing the final RFP must be immediately highlighted to the buyer (Theresa Hay, at 937-255-7210 ext 3006) or CO (Pat Krabacher, at 937-765-0483), respectively.

The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three, four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols; and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities, analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality, mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support; Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support, and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware, Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems, Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings, the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets, architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be tasked thru task order might include participating in project System Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop simulations!  , etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 55,000 labor hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a total three year CORE effort of approximately 180,000 labor hours. The two option years have an estimated 65,000 labor hours each. Customer events will be supported using task orders.   Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award, foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition, exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to perform one or more functions A - D (or E with one of the above) are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned!  , or Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.	What is your experience in this functional area (as described in this  announcement and in the Appendix)?  Please include detailed examples, duration and scope of relevant past work, including names and phone numbers of POCs.   2.	List whatever standard business practices (ISO 9000, CMMI, etc.) to  which you adhere.  Include certification date, method, and level.  3.	Indicate your business size and category and if responding as a  potential prime contractor or sub-contractor. Provide specific examples of your firms capabilities to meet facility/personnel security, ITAR requirements, and to comply with the OCI and ACA restrictions. Sample study scenario may be provided at a later date for your consideration.   Please check the PIXS site for updates. All interested firms are requested to submit their SOC plus any sample study scenarios responses (original plus 2 copies) by 17 Jun 2005, substantiating each qualification described above.  The SOC shall be limited to a maximum of five pages per function. Pages allowed for any sample study scenario responses will be specified when posted to PIXS. Font size for the SOC is no smaller than 10 pt Times New Roman. Submit SOC to ASC/XRS, Attn:  Ms. Patricia Krabacher, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433-7224.  Any responses received not clearly indicating which of the five function support areas the respondent is a potential source for (or which fail to meet the page limitation) may not be considered.  Submit only unclassified information for consideration and evaluation. Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  An organizational conflict of interest clause AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002(Tailored), Organizational Conflict of Interest (Aug 2002)is anticipated in any resultant contract which is likely to restrict OEMs from providing proposals for follow-on efforts.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice for commercial off-the-shelf software to perform Readiness, Reliability and Cost Analyses by the Propulsion and Power community, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland.  This IS NOT a Request for Proposal. No solicitation exists at this time, and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No reimbursement will be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement. This notice is being used as a market research tool to determine potential sources, capabilities and purchase costs for the subject software and tools (described below), and for determining acquisition strategy.  All responsible sources may submit a capability package, which will be considered by this agency. BACKGROUND: The AIR 4.4 department of the Naval Air Systems Command is the lead activity for research and development, systems engineering and integration, engineering analysis and evaluation, test and evaluation, and in-service engineering support of Naval aircraft propulsion systems. These include air breathing engines and manned and unmanned aircraft and missiles; helicopter transmissions and drive systems; aircraft and engine fuel systems, and ground refueling systems; turbine engine fuel; gearbox, propeller and transmission oils and greases and propulsion systems performance. This is a team effort with representatives from the Cost and Logistics/Industrial competencies participating in the review process.
TECHNICAL: The software/analysis tool should project Naval Aviation Fleet reliability, readiness and cost with changes in propulsion system/component reliability, repairability, and spares as well as other inputs that represent total operations, maintenance and support structures. The robust tool should be functional for engines as well as propellers, helicopter drive systems, electrical systems, fuel systems, secondary power systems and any of the subcomponents.  Outputs of the analysis tool should show cost, readiness, reliability and risk trade-offs and sensitivities.
Inputs and variables to the tool should include but not be limited to inventories, acquisitions and retirements, flying rates, reliability by failure mode, component aging, reliability and age relationships, repair scenarios (repair versus replace), repair effectiveness, production capacity and constraints, degrees of maintenance (three levels of maintenance: organizations, Intermediate and depot as well as ship based maintenance), turn-around-times (transportation, in-work, awaiting parts, awaiting maintenance, etc.), spares, spares pool sizes and locations, parts availability, asset location, labor hours, labor classification, part costs, and scrap rates as a minimum.   
Input parameters can be distributions rather than a fixed values where appropriate allowing for a more realistic representation of the environment.  Tools that accept input files from MS-Excel spreadsheets are preferred.  The same is true for outputting results to MS –Excel or MS-Powerpoint for presentations.
Outputs of the model should provide for reliability, readiness and cost trade studies by month or year.  More specifically, illustrate fleet reliability improvements, readiness levels and cost savings or increases as a reliability fix is incorporated over a multiyear implementation plan. Other scenarios to analyze include readiness impacts (available aircraft and engines) with reductions in production capacity while surging flight operations and resulting reduction in reliability.
The tools shall function on a DELL desktop computer with the following minimum specifications: Pentium III Processor, 600 Mhz, 256 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive space using operating system of Windows 2000, and MS-Office.  Ultimately, the software will need to be NMCI certified to run on the Navy Marine Corp Network as well as receive DOD FAM approval.
RESPONSE DEADLINE: Interested sources should submit a capability package by 15 JAN 2006. The package should include general company information such as name and address, and relevant points of contact (including e-mail address and phone number). Respondents should include a list of candidate software products currently available for purchase, and which could potentially meet some or all of the capabilities listed. Company brochures, test results, marketing materials, and any other product information that would show capability should be included.  Commercial pricing sheets/catalogs and any tiered-pricing discount structure should be specified. Products available on Federal Supply Schedule (GSA) contracts which may meet some or all of the requirments should be listed. A list of Government and/or commercial customers can be submitted to show past performance. Electronic responses are encouraged. Email responses shall be sent to Paul.J.Zimmerman@Navy.Mil  and rebecca.barnard@navy.mil with SS# N0042106PR12152005 in the subject line of the email.  Capability packages should be included as attachments to Email (preferred).

That unique capability allows the Department to anticipate responses to state-level economic, regulatory, and legislative trends, rather than merely responding to them retroactively.  It also allows the Department to devise informed longitudinal approaches to those developments.  While other vendors solicited offered limited services, none were able to meet the overall customized needs of the Department.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks information as to potential qualified small businesses and other sources with specific experience and expertise to provide construction, maintenance, ground truth data collection and reporting and support services for optical (photographic and video), infrared line-scanning and synthetic aperture radar calibration targets which are used during missions within the framework of the Treaty on Open Skies.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

The Open Skies Division of DTRA (headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia) is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Treaty on Open Skies.  Signatory states conduct unrestricted aerial observation flights over the territories of other member nations.  Imagery gathered during these aerial observation flights is obtained from four categories of sensors:  optical photographic, optical video, infrared line-scanning and synthetic aperture radar devices.  The treaty limits the best resolution of each type of sensor and establishes a minimum flight altitude at which each sensor configuration might be used.  The process of establishing minimum flight altitudes involves the visual analysis of aerial images of ground-based calibration targets applicable to the type of sensor involved.  The sensor systems, aircraft, and calibration targets must pass a process of international review, inspection and performance verification/certification.  DTRA’s requirement involves the contractor supporting these missions. 

 	Precise specifications for the desired characteristics of an infrared calibration target are under review by the international Open Skies community, once approved, the CONTRACTOR WILL BE REQUIRED TO build, characterize, maintain, and support portable infrared calibration targets.  Such a target must be able to establish the best resolution of an infrared sensor (which the treaty limits to, ‘no better than 50 cm’).  Current design ideas for such infrared calibration targets include the use of multiple, painted, aluminum-coated, marine-grade plywood boards of varying lengths placed on the ground in separate groups of three.  The aluminum must be applied to the wood in such a way as to avoid any uneven thermal coupling resulting from the formation of air pockets between the surface of the wood and the aluminum laminate.  High-quality paints in a variety of grey levels must be applied in such a way as to make a uniform pigment along the entire surface of the board.  The treaty task here is to make the infrared target as homogeneous in its thermal characteristics as possible.  Other efforts required of the contractor would include, but are not limited to, storing, shipping, and maintaining the infrared calibration target.

Similarly, when efforts (such as data collection events, certifications, demonstration flights, annual baseline evaluations, etc.) involve sensors and targets from the other categories, the contractor SHALL support such endeavors with the appropriate, existing calibration targets.  Certified optical and synthetic aperture radar calibration targets are located at Travis AFB, CA and Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  The optical calibration target is a series of black-and-white bars of progressively diminishing length and width painted on airfield concrete with a black, painted background.  Site work may be required to repair, upgrade, or maintain the non-portable calibration targets.  Support for these targets will require the contractor to travel to the target locations.  Support and maintenance of all calibration targets and reporting their characterization data is required.  

Maintenance and support for optical and synthetic aperture radar calibration targets includes, but is not limited to: periodic soft-cleaning, non-destructive snow removal, target deployment, periodic repainting, collecting annual baseline measurement data, collecting ground truth data (as specified in the Treaty on Open Skies and its Annexes) and forwarding those reports to DTRA at the completion of an effort.  Characterization data and other reports shall be provided to DTRA in written and electronic forms.

The contractor shall collect ground truth data at the end of each pass by the Open Skies aircraft over the calibration target.  Target and background reflectivity data will be collected with a spectral photometer and/or spectral radiometer.  A digital camera with 180 degree field of view (FOV) Fish-Eye Lens shall be utilized to document cloud cover over the target.  In addition to the spectral photometer/radiometer and digital camera, the Contractor shall provide the following equipment:
-Global Positioning System (GPS) Inclinometer
-Measuring Tape (5 meter)
-Compass
-Equipment Calibration Certificates (With manufacturers’ specifications)

Mandatory Requirements:

The infrared calibration target must be:
 
•	Portable (the contractor shall be responsible for crating and transporting/shipping the targets to mission locations).
•	Able to establish a range of “delta-T’s” the lowest of which being 3 degrees Celsius relative to the ground or a neighboring component of the calibration target.
•	Able to establish the resolution of a sensor configuration, whose best resolution may not exceed 50 centimeters.
•	Painted according to specified uniformity standards.
•	Rapidly measured by external instrumentation for their radiometric characteristics in the bands from either 3 to 5 or 8 to 12 micrometers.
•	Placed in storage containers that protect the calibration targets’ components during storage, shipping and transportation.
•	Contractor shall provide indoor storage for the duration of the contract.

	DTRA’s intent is to award a single award time and materials, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract categorized under NAICS Code 541330 Engineering Services.  Any prospective small business awardee must perform 51% of the required effort.  The performance period is anticipated to be from 1 September 2006 through 31 August 2007, with four one-year options.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP); it is a market research tool being used to determine the availability, business size and existing contractual vehicles of qualified experienced sources prior to issuing an RFP.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  The amount of information available for publication at this time is limited.  Interested sources are requested to provide clear and convincing evidence of their capability to perform these services.   Interested sources may submit company literature and/or provide a capability summary not to exceed eight (8) pages in length describing their relevant corporate experience providing these types of services as identified above.

<OFFADD>DHS - Border and Transportation Security, Transportation Security Administration, Headquarters TSA, 601 S. 12th Street TSA-25, 10th Floor, Arlington, VA, 22202
<SUBJECT>B -- TSA Registered Traveler Program Request for Information
<DESC>1. General Information
Document:  Request for Information (RFI)

2. Contracting Office Address
Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 701 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 22202 

3. Background
The mission of the Registered Traveler (RT) Program is to expedite screening procedures for qualified individuals at selected U.S. airports.  The RT Program will be a voluntary program in which individuals who provide biometric and biographic data, undergo a TSA security threat assessment, pay a user fee, and are deemed eligible by TSA, will be allowed to use designated or dedicated security lines at participating airports and may receive additional screening benefits correlated to the security threat assessment performed.

The goal of the RT program is to increase the efficiency of the Transportation Security Officers and security resources.  Airline passengers who have successfully completed a security threat assessment by TSA may be expedited through security checkpoint processing and allow security resources to focus on unknown travelers.  TSA anticipates the enhancement of overall aviation security and the likelihood of maintaining or improving non-RT security checkpoint wait times. 

4. Purpose
The TSA Registered Traveler Program (RT) is seeking information to assist in the development of a Business Model to govern the nationwide implementation of the RT program. Specifically, TSA seeks alternative methodologies for implementing each component of the Business Model as well as the technologies or services available to support implementation.

TSA desires innovative and creative ideas for the RT Business Model.  After reviewing the responses, TSA may incorporate into the final model any or all of the information provided.  

5. Critical Functions
Listed below are the critical functions inherent to the RT Program and are mandatory elements for a comprehensive business plan. Other than noting the mandatory nature of these critical functions, TSA does not define how these critical functions are met, and what, if any enhancements or desirables are to be included in the Business Model.   

•	Enrollment and biometric capture
•	Identity/document validation at enrollment
•	Card issuance and revocation
•	Data transfer and storage throughout the system
•	Interface technology for the smart card and verification system
•	Audit processes and procedures
•	Compensation for participating entities
•	Identification verification at the security checkpoint
•	Membership renewal

6.  Program Guidelines
Minimally, the completed Business Model for the national RT program implementation will:
•	Utilize a public-private partnership with clear delineation of roles and responsibilities, including revenue allocation;  
•	Require interoperability of all participating RT program sites from the onset of operations (interoperability is defined as a valid card issued to any eligible participant and is operational at all authorized RT program sites without regard to where the card was issued);
