<DESC>The 118-K-1 Burial Ground has been described as a ¡§general content burial ground¡¨ and is representative of the type of burial ground at Hanford reactor areas that operated from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s.  Attributes of the 118-K-1 Burial Ground include the following:

„h The burial ground is approximately 366 m (1200 ft) x 183 m (600 ft) and consists of numerous trenches and pits of various sizes that contain the waste materials.
„h Six underground vertical silos, each 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and 7.6 m (25 ft) deep, were used to hold reactor hardware that had high dose rates.
„h Three underground vertical silos, each 9.1 m (30 ft) long and 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter contain ashes from an incinerator built in 1968 that was dismantled and buried at the site.
„h Two underground vertical silos, each 9.8 m (32 ft) long and 1.4 m (4.5 ft) in diameter contain irradiated nickel-plated boron steel balls from the reactor emergency 3X system. 

In addition, a wide range of above cleanup level material such as soil, ash, miscellaneous debris, intact containers, buried equipment, soft waste, and structural materials may be encountered during remedial action activities. Individual high dose elements and removable or smearable contamination  may be encountered during remediation, in which case work could be performed in High Radiation Areas (HRAs) and/or Airborne Radiation Areas (ARAs).   Additionally, waste transportation off-site may require specialty packaging or handing due to radiological conditions.                                                          

On-site work shall consider constraints inherent to working in a chemical and/or radiological environment when planning and executing work.  The Offeror shall be familiar with, anticipate and be prepared to perform work operations using different levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) (D, C, and B) as described in 29 CFR 1910.120 Appendix B.

This work scope includes performing remedial design and construction activities as well as furnishing necessary facilities, management, supervision, equipment, labor, materials, supplies, and tools.  It also includes professional engineering and civil survey services to support the Subcontractor preparation and submittal of work plans, ¡§Issued For Construction¡¨ drawings prior to commencement of work, and ¡§as-built¡¨ drawings upon completion of specific work activities.  These services will detail the waste site and structures in the footprint of the waste site, proposed support areas (e.g. lay-down areas, support facilities), and engineering support during field activities.

This work scope also includes performance of operations necessary to excavate, sort, size reduce, stage, containerize/package, load, weigh, maintain and transport above cleanup level materials from the 118-K-1 Burial Ground to the container transfer area in accordance with the Subcontract Documents.  In addition, this work scope includes waste transport container tarping and maintenance, specialty packaging and maintenance, stockpiling of below cleanup level materials, on-site access control, and housekeeping in accordance with the Subcontract Documents.


Potential bidders will be required to be pre-qualified by BHI.  A Pre-Qualification Questionnaire is also available on BHI's website at http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm.  A job site walk-down will be required for potential bidders.  Participants must be able to meet applicable DOE requirements for site access.

The estimated subcontract value for this work is between 4 and 6 million dollars.

<DESC>This project is sponsored jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hereafter referred to as the Government.  The purpose of this project as required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NVCIA), P.L. 99-660, is to provide a single nationwide mechanism by which vaccine adverse events (VAEs) occurring after receipt of vaccines as specified in the NCVIA are collected and analyzed.  It is additionally intended to provide the same reporting mechanism for all other VAEs not specified by the NCVIA.  For all reports, the impetus for reporting is not a presumed causal relationship between the vaccination and the event, but may be based simply on factors such as the occurrence of the event temporally following vaccination and the lack of other obvious causes.  In addition, beginning in 1994, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) participates in the VAERS system by forwarding information to VAERS based on claims filed under the NCVIA.  Clinical experts with the VICP also review selected VAERS reports at the request of the Government, after personal identifying information has been removed from the VAERS reports.  The Contractor will be responsible for all the day-to-day aspects of VAERS operations, including 1) promoting reporting, 2) data collection and entry into a database using standard quality control and quality assurance measures, 3) follow-up of serious and selected other reports, 4) data security, integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality, 5) providing support for CDC and FDA researchers in conducting epidemiologic and other scientific studies of VAERS data, and 6) complete detailed up-to-date documentation for all business processes and IT systems.

It is anticipated that a cost-plus-award-fee contract will be made.  The performance period for the contract will be seven years.  This will be a full and open competition requirement.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about March 19, 2004.

<DESC>This is a follow-up to the market survey announcement that was issued on this web page on August 10, 2004.  That announcement indicated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had a need for specialized technical services to support activities in support of the modernization of the Traffic Flow Management (TFM) system. The announcement also indicated that the FAA was aware of one company - Flatirons Solutions, Inc (a small business) - that could perform these services.  Other small businesses that believed that they had the necessary knowledge, experience, and other skill sets necessary to perform these services as outlined in the August 10 announcement were directed to submit capabilities statements to the FAA for consideration no later than August 16. The FAA received multiple capabilities statements from various companies by the August 16 deadline.  These capabilities statements were evaluated compared to the knowledge, experience, and other skill sets needed for this requirement as indicated in the August 10 announcement.  It was determined that none of the firms submitting capabilities statements in response to this market survey possessed the necessary knowledge, experience, and other skill sets needed for this requirement.  Therefore, in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) Section 3.2.2.4, the FAA has determined to contract for these services with Flatirons Solutions, Inc.  The period of performance will be for one year plus a one-year option, with a total estimated value of $4 million per year.  Questions about this announcement may be directed to the Contracting Officer at the phone number or email address indicated in this announcement.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  GSA will acquire the services of a Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) for the modernization of the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building, Seattle, Washington, under a multi-step advisory and best value source selection process.  A firm fixed price contract is contemplated comprised of a Pre-Construction Base item along with Optional Construction line items.  

CMc RESPONSIBILITIES:  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-Construction Services, all Construction, including relocation and protection of building occupants and cooperation in support of building operation; and Construction Phase Project Management and Administrative Services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design support and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  The CMc must maintain a team with experience and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly construction of the proposed project.  

BUILDING DESCRIPTION:  The Jackson Federal Building (JFB) opened in 1974.  It is an office building, housing multiple agencies.  All agencies are equipped with sensitive IT systems requiring absolute security.  Normal operation of all occupant systems and all building systems, including emergency-mode operation of emergency systems, must be maintained throughout the project.  The CMc shall provide full cooperation with GSA building operations staff to assure that occupants and operations are sustained without lapse during extended business operation hours.  The building occupies the hillside block between 1st and 2nd Avenues, and Madison and Marion Streets.  It is 36 stories plus basement and penthouse.  The 32+ story steel frame tower stands on a 5-story reinforce concrete base structure.  The steel frame is fire-protected, with asbestos containing material used for floors 5 through floor 30.  There are 22 elevators.  The HVAC system is predominantly dual-duct variable volume, with fully programmable electronic controls.  Return air is conducted through the ceiling space.  The building is fully sprinklered.  The fire alarm system provides emergency notification to the occupants, and automatic shutdown of the forced air systems.  Emergency mode operation includes limited service by activation of an emergency generator, and manual operation of a partial smoke management by the Fire Department.  Access to the building is carefully controlled for security purposes, and all project personnel must receive security clearance.  There will be no contractor parking on site and projects storage space on site is severely limited.  There may be simultaneous, separate construction contracts within the building. 

PROJECT SUMMARY:  Project will provide improvements to building infrastructure along with renovations to various areas within the building.  Project work consists of multiple Project Packages (PP); some interrelated with each other, some independent.  Three Prime Design teams were engaged to accomplish the design work for one or more Project Package (PP).  The PP numbering reflects this as follows: PP/11 – Building frame seismic structural work.  PP/12 – Elevator control systems, some elevator hardware, and structural work in the shafts – plus an elevator maintenance agreement.  PP/13 – ADA improvements for restrooms.  PP/14 – Repair or replace membrane and masonry of the exterior multilevel plaza.  PP/21 and PP/21A – Heating system conversion to Natural Gas.  PP/22 - Smoke management systems improvements.  PP/23 – Miscellaneous mechanical work.  PP/31 and PP/31A – Cafeteria kitchen, servery, and dining room modernization.  Project management details, including pricing, tracking, payment, and closeout will be conducted, as much as possible, by PP.  The maximum ECC (Estimated Construction Cost) is between $30-$40 Million.  As a potential price control measure GSA may opt to acquire the heat system conversion as an individual contract.   

CMc SELECTION PROCESS:  A negotiated, best value, fixed price contract under FAR15.101-1, will be used for selection of the CMc.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-Step (FAR15.202) and Source Selection Procedures (FAR15.3).  

STEP 1 Request for Qualifications (RFQ):  This step invites potential offerors to submit information based on criteria that allows GSA to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors.  GSA will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in future postings, and shall advise each respondent either that it will be invited to participate in the resulting acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor for this acquisition.  GSA will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  The Offerors are reminded that in accordance with FAR 15.202, notwithstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resulting acquisition.  Firms that do not submit a response to Step 1 will not be eligible to compete in the resulting acquisition (step 2).  The RFQ, selection criteria and submission date for Step 1 will be issued in a forthcoming posting. 

STEP 2:  The offerors who are invited to participate in the resulting acquisition will be issued a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will include additional selection criteria along with detail construction documents.

SB-SDB Participation:  Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged o participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities.

INTERESTED FIRMS:  Are requested to provide a response of interest to this posting to wayne.benjamin@gsa.gov, request only that prime contractors provide a notice of interest.  ******Future postings will detail the response date and criteria elements for STEP1, Pre-Solicitation site visit and networking session.******

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with 4 floors of tenant fit-out (approximately 170,000 sf) for the U.S. District Court and systems upgrade of the Everett McKinley Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and the preparation of design documents are required for this modernization project. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the 30 story Dirksen Courthouse, located at 219 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, was completed in 1964. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.


This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project and be providing project management. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the overall concept development and preservation plan.  


The project scope of work consists of tenant alterations, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) upgrades (renovation/replacement of the entire perimeter induction unit system), restroom renovation, fire-alarm replacement, and asbestos/lead based paint abatement. The tenant alterations will consist of building out of approximately 170,000 square feet of vacant space (4 full floors, 1 of which is partially occupied) to provide for increasing space requirements for court-related federal agencies.


The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and backfill as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and PCCS (Post Construction Contract Start Services).  Scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Dirksen Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide. 
 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and the Lead Designer experienced in the preservation of significant mid-twentieth century buildings.  From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic modernist high-rise structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II), modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:


(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past fifteen years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings and the solemn client functions as are found within the U.S. Federal Courts. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    


(2)      LEAD DESIGNER AND ENGINEER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall each submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designers. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings.  The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution. 


(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy and their approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of historic buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office buildings may affect their approach and design process.  Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.


(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage. During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed Stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer/Mechanical Engineer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area, which is the State of Illinois.  Any business arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.


This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses.

<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, MD. (NSWCIH) intends to award a Sole Source Purchase Order to Dynasen Incorporated. The procurement will consist of producing and supplying gauges and ionization pins.  The requested gauges will be used to measure pressures in explosives during gun experiments, during which a projectile impacts a piece of explosive and produces a shock wave, which then increases the pressure in the explosive. The ionization pins are electrical pins that are inserted into explosive charges where the pin will electrically short and produce a signal. Specifications of the gauges and ionization pin are as follows: Item 1.  Low Impedance Manganin Pressure Gauges - 0.050 Ohm Nominal Resistance - Encapsulation must be 0.005” thick FEP Teflon.  Gauges must be encapsulated in Sheets so that “gauge paddle” assemblies can be made that are 3” in diameter and that leads extend 1.25” from the 3” diameter paddle sections.  Gauges must be constructed with a hot!  laminating process.  Gauge leads other than active area must be copper plated.  Gauges must have two current leads and two signal leads.  Gauges must be made of etched Teflon to facilitate gluing to target.  Gauges must measure pressure to 400 kbar.  Government will have the choice to make gauges out of 0.001” manganin foil supplied by NSWC IH or use 0.001” foil supplied by the manufacturer. Item 2.  50 Ohm Manganin Pressure Gauges - 50 Ohm Nominal Resistance - Encapsulation must be 0.001” thick FEP Teflon.  Gauges must be encapsulated in Sheets so that “gauge paddle” assemblies can be made that are 3” in diameter and that leads extend 1.25” from the 3” diameter paddle sections.  Gauges must be made of etched Teflon to facilitate gluing to target.  Gauges must measure pressure to 100 kbar. Item 3.  Ionization pins of 0.32” in diameter to measure detonation velocity in explosives. Center pin must be centered at pin face. Connector must be furnished to connect to 50 ohm imped! ance coax cable. Cable will be stripped to provide a 1” pig tail. Pin length will be 1.5 inches.  Approximate issue date of this Purchase Order is 17 Sept 04.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis an Vanguard 355 nm 350 mW mode-locked solid state laser with Spectra-Physics, 1335 Terra Bella Ave, PO Box 7013, Mountain View California,94039. The services and supplies will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The NCI Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory, provides essential optical biology services to the Branch and to other investigators in the NCI and NIH.  The core is committed to maintaining an up-to-date array of instrumentation for its investigators.  Our BD Biosciences FACSVantage DiVa flow cytometer currently relies on a Coherent I-302C krypton-ion laser as our sole course of ultraviolet excitation for cell sorting.  This laser is necessary for a number of flow cytometry techniques, including Hoechst side population analysis of stem cells, and measurement of calcium flux in immune and tumor cells.  This laser is very maintenance and utility-intensive, requiring a high-voltage AC line (208 volt , 3 phase power line with 60 amps per phase of current), a continuous source of chilled building water, and a recirculating heat exchanger to maintain proper laser temperature.  This laser is still functional but is reaching the end of its useful service life (5 years).  The NCI ETIB Flow Core is planning to move to the new Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) in October 2004.  Unfortunately, the space reserved for the core does not have the necessary high voltage electrical and chilled water lines necessary to operate the Coherent I-302C laser.  Unlike the current Coherent unit, the Vanguard laser requires only normal 110V electrical service and needs no water cooling, eliminating the need for a chilled water source and a recirculator.  This unit represents the state-of-the-art in solid state laser technology and has far fewer maintenance requirements than the krypton source, which requires frequent alignments to maintain its power level.  The Vanguard laser will operate at a much lower per-hour cost and is expected to have a 10,000 hour lifetime, well in excess of our current krypton unit.  Spectra-Physics is the only source known to the NCI that is currently the only manufacturer to produce a mode-locked solid state UV laser with sufficient pulse frequency (>10 MHz)  and duration to function as a source for flow cytometry.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40165-NG.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cellular Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis services for Validation of methylation in a promising panel of genes in cervical cancer, precancer, and normal cervix tissues and cells with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, Texas 75390.  The services and supplies will be procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.   In 2004, NCI/DCEG performed methylation profiling of cervical cancer study using NotI-based restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS).  RLGS was used to scan the human genome for methylated CpG islands, thus identifying methylated CpG islands that may reflect inactivation of TSGs.  This effort identified several markers of possible utility in understanding the progression of HPV infection to neoplasia and in early detection of cervical precursors.  Based on this work, we are currently working with investigators at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, New York) to develop target-specific, optimized real-time PCR assays for three of the most promising markers (found methylated in the highest frequency among cervical cancers compared to controls).  Validation by diagnosis and by specimen type will be conducted for these three markers in the following: (a) cervical cancers (n=15 archived frozen tissues), (b) CIN3 (n=20 liquid-based cytology specimens, (c) human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cytology specimens (n=50).  Recently, researchers at UT Southwestern have published data using conventional methylation specific PCR assays indicating that the tumor necrosis factor decoy receptor DcR1 was methylated in 50 of 50 cervical cancers tested.  Unpublished pilot data from this group has further demonstrated markers detectable in liquid-based clinical cervical cytology specimens and present in precursor lesions.  In addition to the decoy receptor, four promising methylation markers have also been identified for identifying early cervical neoplasia (82-100%) by this group.  Of particular interest are genes that are not typically methylated in low grade lesions that have been found to be methylated in precancer.  However, optimized real-time PCR (RT PCR) assays for this panel developed at UT Southwestern have not been developed.  The goal of the present work is to therefore, develop optimized RT PCR assays for the two decoy receptors as well as the additional promising markers and to subsequently use these assays to test the same set cervix tissues/cells (cancer, precancer, and normal) that will be tested in our on-going validation work based on RLGS results.  The laboratory of Dr. Adi Gazdar at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center is the only source known to the NCI that can develop the assays and further validate these unpublished markers in cervix specimens.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to compete a requirement currently being performed by Family Health International (FHI) under Contract No. N01-AI-05403.  This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  DMID supports extramural research to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases caused by virtually all human infectious agents except HIV.  DMID supports projects spanning the entire spectrum of biomedical research from early basic research through phase III clinical trials.  Through the contemplated contract, DMID intends to establish and maintain an International Clinical Studies Support Center (ICSSC).  The primary goal of the ICSSC is to enhance the capacity of international clinical sites to perform clinical research in accordance with international standards, such as the International Conference on Harmonization’s (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and to facilitate the planning and conduct of clinical evaluations of interventions against infectious disease.  Studies that require support include epidemiologic studies and clinical trials that range from small, early phase trials to large multi-center efficacy trials. These studies are conducted throughout the world, primarily in Africa, South and Central America, and Asia.  The primary focus of this solicitation is assistance and site development activities rather than regulatory compliance or monitoring activities as these services are provided under other DMID-funded contracts.  The activities of all concerned contractors will be coordinated by DMID staff.  Work to be performed will include: assessment of the readiness of sites to conduct clinical studies; development and design of clinical protocols; training in clinical research design and conduct, including GCP and ethical issues, data management, statistical analysis, and safety monitoring and; logistical/operational aspects of managing the DMID international clinical research portfolio.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about July 20, 2005, and require an estimated 4 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity. This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 15, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<CONTACT>Sharon Osborne, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-1219, Fax 202/344-1254, Email sharon.osborne@dhs.gov
<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is initiating competitive procurement action for a five year, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for Personal Radiation Detectors (PRD).  This action was formerly designated as RFP HSBP1004R0088.  Two types of detectors will be acquired, those that detect gamma rays and those that detect both gamma rays and neutrons.  Annual order quantities will vary from a minimum of 300 to a maximum of 5,000 for each type.   A contract may be awarded for one or both types.

This procurement is being conducted in two steps.  The first step will be product testing.  Vendors who wish to participate in this procurement must submit two samples of their product or products for testing, two samples of each type proposed. The items will be tested for conformity with CBP’s specifications.  A copy of the specifications is available by email only.  Please submit requests  to Dean.Titcomb @associates.dhs.gov or to the contracting officer, Sharon Osborne, at Sharon.Osborne@dhs.gov.

The testing is free to vendors.  Items offered for testing must be provided at no expense to the Government.  The Government assumes no liability for damage to items during testing.  Items will be returned, as is, in post-testing condition.

Testing will be conducted at a Government laboratory.  Testing will evaluate each unit’s technical performance, physical characteristics and ease of operation against CBP’s performance specifications.  Generally, each PRD device (gamma detector units and gamma/neutron detector units) shall be approximately the size of a typical pager and alert the wearer to above background levels of ambient gamma rays only or (ii) ambient gamma rays and neutron radiation.  The PRD must be maintenance free, of rugged construction (able to withstand concrete drop test), weather resistant, and battery operated.  The PRD shall produce a visual (light), audible (tone), and (tactile) vibratory alarm when the radiation intensity, due to gamma rays and/or neutrons, exceeds a preset level.  

Offerors whose products pass this testing will be invited to participate in the contract negotiations conducted in step 2.  If determined that two small businesses (domestic products manufactured by a small business) pass step 1 testing, step 2 of the procurement will then be issued, in whole or in part, as a small business set-aside. 

Detectors offered for testing must arrive at the Procurement Office address given above, addressed to the contacting officer. Each offeror must include a signed cover letter to the contracting officer offering its commercial item(s) for testing at no expense or liability to the Government.  The offer must indicate its business size, include unit operating instructions, identify the model number, manufacturer, manufacturer’s address and business size, percentage of domestic content per item, and points of contact for technical and contracting matters.

Step 1 submittals are due in the Procurement Office listed above not later than 2:00 PM, local time, September 24, 2004.

This requirement is being procured in accordance with Title XII, Trauma Care, Section 1201, P.L. 101-590, authorized by P.L. 105-392.  The purpose of this procurement is to (1) Collect and report to the Federal Program information on the public’s attitudes, level of awareness, and general understanding of trauma care and trauma systems availability in their communities; (2) Develop recommendations for the public information and education component of the Federal Program’s strategic plan; and (3) Share findings and recommendations with the Federal Program, trauma stakeholders/partners and State trauma system managers through a variety of written, web, and meeting formats.

This requirement will be awarded under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated period of performance is for eight (8) months.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The U. S. Navy intends to procure, on a sole source basis, nineteen interim message processing systems for E-6B aircraft from Rockwell Collins.  The hardware and software of the current message processing system, the Mission Computer Set (MCS), are expected to become unsupportable by 2007.  An interim message processing system is required by 2007 to bridge the gap between MCS obsolescence and final fielding of the Mission Avionics Processing System (MAPS) as part of the Block I Modification (Block I) program in 2014.  MAPS will perform all of the message processing functions required by the E-6B mission.  The interim message processing system hardware and software will be highly common with the Block I MAPS to avoid duplicative development, operations and maintenance costs of an interim message processing solution separate from MAPS.  Interim message processing system installations in E-6B aircraft must begin no later than 2007.  Rockwell Collins is the sole designer and developer of E-6B Block I modifications including MAPS. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a modification under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Rockwell Collins (Richardson, TX) for this procurement on a sole source basis.  This award is based on FAR 6.302-1, whereby the supplies and services required are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  No additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation documents regarding this announcement is currently available.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  GENERAL INFORMATION: Any further inquires should be directed in writing by October 4, 2004 to Jeffrey L. O’Neil, AIR-2.3.1.4.2, Numbered notes 22 and 26 apply.

1.0 GENERAL

1.1 Background 

The Federal Supply Service (FSS) is one of the four major components of the General Services Administration (GSA).  Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act in 1949 establishing GSA’s FSS as a central organization to “provide an economic and efficient system for the procurement, supply and disposal of surplus property and performance of related functions.”  With a projected business volume of over $30 billion a year, FSS offers more services and products than any commercial enterprise in the world.
For many years, State and local officials have expressed their interest in using the U. S. General Services Administration’s (GSA’s) information technology (IT) schedule contracts.  Recent passage of the E-Government Act of 2002 in December 2002 has turned that interest into a reality.   However, it took nearly five months before an interim rule was published revising GSA’s General Services Administration Acquisition Regulations (GSAR) to implement Section 211 of the E-Government Act of 2002 to permit use of the GSA Schedule 70, IT contracts to State and local governments.
The goal of the new rule is make “government” (considering all levels) more efficient by reducing duplication of effort and using volume purchasing techniques for the acquisition of IT products and services.  The 50 states, 3139 counties, 19,365 incorporated municipalities, 30,386 minor subdivisions, 3,200 public housing authorities, 14,178 school districts, 1,625 public educational institutions of higher learning, and 550 Indian tribal governments are among the potential new users of the IT Schedule 70 contracts

Fifteen states have written commitments in cooperative purchasing with the Federal Government, with the expectation that more states will follow suit.  The state market for IT initiatives requires GSA to be pro-active in finding the solutions to assist each state in their procurement process.  This requires GSA to become more knowledgeable in the best means to support state cooperative purchasing agreements.

GSA’s Federal Supply Service (FSS) is conducting research to become better educated on state and local markets and how to best reach and assist this customer 


2.0 SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Service (FSS), Office of Marketing (FM), is seeking a contractor subscription service to assist GSA in gaining and maintaining current and accurate data and information for each of the 50 States and top counties and cities, and thereby supporting, State Cooperative Purchasing initiatives. Our goal is to establish a long term partnership with each individual state by becoming a value-added, necessary partner in each state’s Information Technology (IT) acquisition process.  

The contractor will provide unlimited access or licenses for ALL GSA Associates and GSA will pay the agreed yearly rate.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, water and wastewater distribution systems at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:
Installation: Yuma Proving Ground 
Location: Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona is located 25 miles north of the city of Yuma, Arizona.  
Installation Description:  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) is located adjacent to the Colorado River in the Sonora Desert, 25 miles north of the city of Yuma, Arizona. It is approximately 180 miles east of San Diego, California and approximately 185 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona. YPG is generally “U-shaped” and covers over 1,300 square miles, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. YPG’s boundaries extend 58 miles north and south and 52 miles east and west. YPG also has limited access rights over and in the KOFA Game Refuge, located in the center of the “U”.
YPG’s history dates back to 1943 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the Yuma Test Branch (the Test Branch) along the Colorado River below the Imperial Dam to test new bridge designs, boats, vehicles and well-drilling equipment. After the war, the work at the Test Branch declined until the Installation, in January 1950, was temporarily turned over to the Corps of Engineers. Yuma Test Station (the Station) was reactivated a year later and placed under the control of the Sixth Army. The primary mission of the Station was expanded to conduct desert environmental testing of military equipment. In 1962, control of the Station was reassigned to the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and placed under the immediate control of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The Installation’s name was changed to Yuma Proving Ground in 1963. In 1974, YPG was designated as a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) by the Department of Defense (DoD).
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.  Electrical Distribution System Description
Yuma Proving Ground receives electrical power at three delivery points from three suppliers. The majority of the Installation’s electrical requirements are delivered at 161 kV from Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) at Substation H (KOFA Substation). Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District (Wellton-Mohawk) provides 12.5 kV delivery points along Martinez Lake Road. The new owner will share an easement with Wellton-Mohawk to allow Wellton-Mohawk access to their Martinez Lake line. Arizona Public Service Company (APS) provides a 12.5 kV delivery point at Cibola Lake Road. In addition to the primary WAPA delivery point at Substation H, WAPA provides an alternate 69 kV supply point at Senator Wash Tap. This alternate supply point is only used as a contingency. Additionally, Wellton-Mohawk must have access to the 69 kV Senator Wash Tap line, which serves Hidden Shores.
Yuma Proving Ground owns and operates an electrical utility system consisting of:
•	10 substations;
•	approximately 189.3 circuit-miles of 69 kV, 34.5 kV, and 12.5 kV pole-line;
•	approximately 27.6 circuit-miles of 12.5 kV underground distribution line; and
•	two photo-voltaic generating stations.

B.  Water System Description
The water utility system at YPG actually consists of nine potable water (PW) and five non-potable water (NPW) systems. The nine PW systems serve the MAA, YTC, LAAF, KFFS, KFFN, CDH/CDA, WETA, CIB and NFF areas. Two of the five non-potable systems serve the MAA and DYNO areas and the remaining three systems serve outlying areas within the KFRE area. The water utility systems components include 18 active water wells, two water treatment plants (WTP), seven booster pump stations (BPS), 13 ground storage tanks, five elevated storage tanks and approximately 276,510 linear feet of pipe ranging in size from less than 2-inch to 14-inch in diameter. The drinking water systems are regulated by the state of Arizona. Six (6) systems are recognized, of which five (5) of those six (6) systems are regulated by the State of Arizona. Water rights are not included in the privatization of the system and are not in any way, shape, or form to be considered as part of, or within the scope of this solicitation.

C.  Wastewater Utility System Description
The wastewater utility systems at the Proving Ground consist of five separate collection and treatment systems. The five wastewater utility systems include systems which serve the MAA, YTC, LAAF, KFFS and CDH/CDA areas. Although the MAA wastewater utility system includes the sewage lift stations (SLS) and force mains, the other four systems are primarily gravity systems. The wastewater utility systems components include approximately 87,105 linear feet of pipe ranging in size from less than 4-inch to 12-inch in diameter, 179 manholes, four SLSs and five sewage lagoons. (The wastewater utility component quantities were “taken-off” of the utility system drawings provided by Installation personnel.) Several outlying areas have septic tank systems with perforated pipe drain fields. These systems are not included in this privatization action. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Christine Bond Jawish at 703-767-3298 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after September 17, 2004.

For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:
Installation: Fort Sam Houston 
Location: Fort Sam Houston, Texas is located in San Antonio, Texas.
	Installation Description:  Fort Sam Houston consists of three major areas: Fort Sam Houston Main Cantonment, Camp Bullis, and the Canyon Lake Recreation Area (CLRA).  Fort Sam Houston and its sub-installations, Camp Bullis and CLRA occupy approximately 31,000 acres in south-central Texas, in Bexar and Comal counties. Fort Sam Houston (approximately 3,150 acres) is located within the city limits of San Antonio, in Bexar County, Texas, 2.5 miles northeast of downtown San Antonio. Camp Bullis (approximately 28,000 acres) is located approximately 18 miles northwest of Fort Sam Houston, on a site about 10 miles long (north to south) and 4 miles wide, in Bexar County. The CLRA (110 acres) is an outdoor recreation area located in rural Comal County, 48 miles northeast of Fort Sam Houston, within Jacob’s Creek Park in the Canyon Lake Reserve.
	Fort Sam Houston is unique among Army posts.  It is a major, active military installation which plays a vital role in the defense of the United States and it contains some of the oldest structures on any of the Army’s installations dating back almost a century and a half. The Post first occupied rented land in 1845 and grew into a major garrison by the late 1800s.  Since then, it has developed into a large modern military installation.  Its mission began to shift toward a medical emphasis after World War II as a result of the presence of Brooke General Hospital and relocations of other medical missions to Fort Sam Houston.  Much of the Fort Sam Houston surrounding area is established, with only minor growth likely to occur in the future. The City’s John James Park and the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery (owned and administered by the U.S. Veterans Administration) are contiguous with the Fort Sam Houston property on the northeast end of the post. 

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.	Water Distribution System Description
The Fort Sam Houston potable water distribution system consists of the network and all associated appurtenances physically connected to the system as defined by the points of demarcation beginning at the production of well water and ending at each end use facility. The system may include, but is not limited to wells, well pumps, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, pumps, and meters.  
The Fort Sam Houston water distribution system is physically separated into three distribution systems. One system serves Fort Sam Houston Cantonment Area, the second serves Camp Bullis, and the third serves Canyon Lake Recreation Area (CLRA).
The potable water distribution system at Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis, and CLRA supplies water for residential, commercial, industrial, and fire fighting purposes. The independent systems serve approximately 1,280; 280; and 40 facilities respectively.
The potable water distribution piping system consists of approximately 76 miles of buried piping ranging in size from 0.75-inch service lines to 16-inch main lines. Other components include wells, pumps, treatment facilities, elevated tanks, fire hydrants, valves, and meters.  Quantities of specific sizes will be available in the actual RFP.   

B.	Wastewater Utility System Description 
The Fort Sam Houston wastewater collection and treatment systems are physically separated into three separate systems. One system serves the Fort Sam Houston Main Cantonment, the second serves Camp Bullis, and the third serves the Canyon Lake Recreation Area (CLRA). The wastewater collection system at Fort Sam Houston collects wastewater from administrative, industrial, and residential facilities for off-installation treatment by the San Antonio Water System. The system serves approximately 1,280 facilities on the Main Cantonment area. Camp Bullis collects and treats wastewater from approximately 250 facilities and is a permitted zero discharge Installation. CLRA collects and treats wastewater from approximately 40 facilities, discharging the treated effluent into Canyon Lake.
Fort Sam Houston Wastewater
The system that serves the Main Cantonment area does not include any treatment facilities. Wastewater is collected and discharged to the San Antonio Water System collection network at 21 locations on the Post. The wastewater collection system consists of gravity sewer laterals and mains, force mains, manholes, clean-outs, and lift stations. Construction of the wastewater collection system infrastructure began in the early 1940s and continues today as the installation missions change and new facilities are constructed. Since 1990, approximately 50 percent of the collection mains and laterals have been slip lined or replaced with PVC pipe. Most of, but not all of the new PVC pipe was installed with marking tape. Manholes in these areas have been refurbished with concrete lining or replaced. The older infrastructure is primarily vitrified clay with brick manholes but does include other pipe materials such as terra cotta, concrete, cast iron, and asbestos-cement pipe. The non-metallic pipe was not installed with marking tape to locate the lines. The pipe ranges from 6 to 48 inches in diameter, with the majority of the mains between 15 and 24 inches in diameter. The collection piping is between 4 and greater than 15 feet below grade with the average approximately 8 feet below grade. Approximately 8 percent is beneath paved surfaces. The prevailing subsurface at Fort Sam Houston is dry sandy clay.
Camp Bullis Wastewater
On-site wastewater treatment at Camp Bullis consists of a 69,000 gpd activated sludge package plant and a facultative lagoon and chlorine contact basin. The plant was designed to handle a 2-hour peak load of 2.3 MGD and was installed in 1997. The treatment facility consists of a comminutor, activated sludge reactor, secondary clarifier, aerobic digestor, and three lagoons, connected in series, with a total surface area of approximately 6.6 acres. The first lagoon is approximately 110 feet by 120, the second is approximately 350 feet by 317 feet, and the third is approximately 290 feet by 570 feet.  All lagoons are approximately 6 feet deep, and the combined volume of the lagoons is approximately 12.9 million gallons, or 64,000 cubic yards. Trash collected on the treatment plant bar screens is bagged in plastic bags and placed in a specially constructed dumpster. Off-site disposal of this trash as well as the sludge is Contracted out. 
The treatment system includes an irrigation system that uses the treated effluent to irrigate the grass on the ranges. Up to 190 acres can be irrigated with the system; however, only approximately 80 acres are currently irrigated. Two 150-Hp pumps feed the irrigation system. The Camp Bullis system is a permitted, zero-discharge system.
There are 5 lift stations on Camp Bullis. Each has submersible grinder pumps. Since 1990, approximately 50 percent of the collection system has been replaced with PVC pipe or slip lined. Most of, but not all of the new PVC pipe was installed with marking tape. The older portions that have not been replaced are primarily vitrified clay. The vitrified clay pipe was not installed with marking tape to locate the lines. All manholes have been upgraded to concrete; none are brick. The majority of the piping is between 4 and 8 feet below grade, but there is an area where the depth reaches 20 feet. The pipe ranges from 2 to 14 inches in diameter. Approximately 8 percent of the buried infrastructure is beneath paved surfaces. The prevailing subsurface at Camp Bullis is rock.
CLRA Wastewater
A 60,000-gallon-per-day (gpd) aeration package plant treats sanitary wastewater from the recreation area and discharges treated wastewater into Canyon Lake. The point of demarcation is the end of the outfall pipe. The plant is permitted to discharge 10,000 gpd. Wastewater is discharged IAW TPDES permit TX12074-001.  
The treatment plant consists of a bar screen, two aeration tanks in series, two primary clarifiers in parallel, a holding tank, and a chlorine contact chamber. In 1983, a 55,000 gallon holding tank was added to the system. The original design was to use one clarifier as a secondary clarifier. Due to peak loading during holidays, both clarifiers are operated in parallel. There is no cathodic protection on the treatment facilities at CLRA.
Trash collected off the bar screen is placed in plastic bags that are placed into a special-built dumpster. The trash and sludge generated from the treatment facility are disposed of off-site by contract. 
The collection system at CLRA is a gravity system. The collection system consists of 6-inch vitrified clay pipe. Approximately 8 percent is beneath paved surfaces. The burial depth ranges from 18-inches to 6-feet, with an average of about 4-feet. The prevailing subsurface at CLRA is rock.
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security intends to negotiate/award a sole source, Cost-Plus-No-Fee Contract for the study of Water Treatment Utility Conversion from Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection to the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, 1816 Jefferson Place, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20036. AMSA represents the interests of the country’s wastewater treatment agencies, true environmental practitioners that serve the majority of the sewered population in the United States and collectively treats and reclaims more than 18 billion gallons of wastewater each day.  AMSA proposes to develop a decision tree document for distribution to water and wastewater treatment plants currently utilizing gaseous chlorine for disinfection.  AMSA will also develop a report template for these plants to document their evaluation in a consistent form that the Department of Homeland Services may wish to utilize should federal funds be available to support public utilities in their desire to eliminate the use of gaseous chlorine at their facilities.  The decision tree will facilitate the evaluation of the costs and the benefits of conversion to alternate forms of disinfection.   The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of 41 United States Code 253 (c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.    See Numbered Notes 22 and 26. For contractual questions, contact Glenna J. Paulson @ (202) 357-8323.

<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed a small-scale, pressure let down liquefaction system for use with natural gas pipelines.  This novel system has the features of being low cost, scalable, and flexible in relation to different gas compositions it can liquefy.   The pressure let down liquefaction process includes proprietary technology for removing CO2 and other pipeline gas contaminants. 
  
INEEL is presently seeking interest from qualified industrial firms to undertake a new research and development project that will focus on the design and fabrication of a small-scale prototype system capable of liquefying and/or using 100% of the gas feed stream produced from stranded gas wells, coal bed methane production, landfills or renewable biogas.   A system will be designed to optimize energy energy and to cost effectively remove undesirable constituents such as CO2, Water and H2S.  

The phase-gate project will also identify the minimum requirements to meet the needs of stranded gas applications and would make incorporate existing technologies and components, where possible to reduce development costs.  The three-year development project will culminate with deployment and demonstration of a prototype system.  The INEEL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in this project.  It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding and “in-kind” support being provided by the participant(s).  Interested parties should respond on or before 9/30/2004.  Questions relating to the proposed project may be directed to the contacts listed below:

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify the difference between two solicitation numbers F11626-03-R0017 and F11626-03-R-0017.  Both of these solicitations pertain to the same Worldwide Express Small Package Service opportunity and the only difference between the two numbers is a missing dash (-) after the R in the solicitation number.  The correct solicitation number should read:  F11626-03-R-0017.  Because of the missing dash (-), the Federal Business Opportunity website treats them as two separate solicitations, when in fact, they are the same solicitation.  Therefore, the three postings listed under F11626-03-R0017 (solicitation number without dash):  Synopsis posted 26 Feb 04, Vendor Questions posted 17 Mar 04, and Amendment 01 posted 22 Apr 04 are applicable to 
F11626-03-R-0017 (solicitation number with dash).  Based on the above situation, Amendment 01 posted on 26 Apr 04 to F11626-03-R-0017 (solicitation number with dash) is incorrectly labeled Amendment 01 and should read Amendment 02.

<CONTACT>Mark Snell, Contract Specialist, Phone (360396-0239, Fax (360)396-0853, Email mark.snell@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.  Note, an additional Large 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.  The only plan-holder list available is via the ESOL website under this solicitation number.  Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on or about October 5, 2004.  The estimated period of proposal preparation will be 30 days.  The e-mail address for inquiries is: mark.snell@navy.mil.

<DESC>This amendment deletes Mark Stiles as the secondary point of contact and provides answers to questions in response to the RFI.  The questions and responses are as follows: ·	Does NASA view “commercial capabilities” as including any fixed price contracting mechanism, or does it mean FAR Part 12 arrangements with significant private capital at risk?   This RFI does not assume contract types as it is simply a method of seeking information. ·	Would NASA prefer that companies offer such “hybrid” services in response to this RFI, or to the transportation services RFI, or both?   NASA has no preferences on which RFI “hybrid” services should respond to. ·	Is providing microgravity research time on orbit separate from ISS (eg. a free flyer) a microgravity research service or a transportation service?  What about via a suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicle?  Because some activities, such as microgravity research, may blur the line between operations and transportation service, we suggest companies respond to any RFI they feel is suited to their capabilities. ·	Is the goal of the RFI simply to determine how NASA might change how it works with contractors to meet an internal NASA contractor percentage objective, or is the goal to privatize NASA functions and bring in private companies that NASA has not been able to work with effectively to date? The purpose of the RFI is to gather comments and innovative ideas on space operational activities. It also provides an opportunity for the private sector to communicate its ideas and interests to NASA. ·	Assuming NASA creates a separate RFP to acquire “non-transportation” applications form commercial providers: ·	Which part of NASA is expected to the lead the procurement?   ·	What is the anticipated budget?   ·	When might such an RFP be released?  The RFI is seeking information and ideas; no RFP is currently planned.  ·	Are there more instructions regarding the 20 page white paper?	 ·	For example is there a specific size and font to be used?   ·	Should lines be single or double spaces?   ·	Can graphics be included?   ·	Would it be permissible to include Appendix in addition to the 20 page paper?   There are no restrictions on size, font or spacing. Graphics may be included. The RFI is limited to 20 pages total. ·	It is responsive to discuss services for NASA where the provided service is not transportation, but where the service may include a transportation element?  Yes. The due date for responses is not extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for any further amendments to this RFI.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.     
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available software database applications.     Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     

The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:     

Currently, United States Air Force aircraft maintenance stands are made of metal materials. Extensive amounts of manpower, equipment and time are expended for corrosion treating and repairing these maintenance stands. Transporting these stands also requires a substantial amount of airlift and sealift capacity for deployments. Conventional metal stands require periodic cleaning, repairs and refinishing due to the re-occurrence of corrosion. The AEFB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

       These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.       A platform height range adjustable from 36? to 144?
2.       A platform with a working area of approx. 46? x 78?
3.       36? wide steps facilitating ease of climbing with tools
4.       1200 lb load capacity on raised platform
5.       1100 lb total unit weight
6.       A simple elevation mechanism
7.       Able to withstand the rigors of towing and using in an all weather flight line environment

       These attributes are considered beneficial by the USAF:

1.       72? width (eliminates need for outriggers)
2.       Stackable in the stowed position (two high)
3.       No more than 1500 lbs total unit weight

The AEFB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.       The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.       The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.       The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.       Your interest to demonstrate your product using dummy data the AEFB provides.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 24 Sep 04 to TSgt Ron Newpher, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.     TSgt Ron Newpher can be reached at (208) 828-3522, newpherrb@mountainhome.af.mil.       A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.     Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.     The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (AFRL Rome) is seeking capable sources to perform research and development in the area of Joint AirSpace Management And Deconfliction (JASMAD).  

Anticipated deliverables include software, technical documentation and user manuals.  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a period of performance of 60 months is anticipated.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from Small Businesses and will be used for market research purposes and a possible set-aside determination.    

Responses should demonstrate the capability to perform the majority of the scope of work described below; special emphasis should be placed on demonstrating knowledge, expertise and previous experience in the operational and technical areas required for successful completion of the program.  Should the determination be made to restrict this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.     

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.     

Large businesses are encouraged to submit emails of intent to Kelly Conniff, conniffk@rl.af.mil, should this effort not be selected as a set-aside.     

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (AFRL Rome) is seeking sources for research and development in multiple technology areas. The scope of this effort is to develop, demonstrate and transition technology that can be used to create, deconflict and manage airspace during Air Tasking Order (ATO) and Airspace Control Order (ACO) planning and execution for current and advanced platforms. Close collaboration with Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) planners will support an effective defensive counter air mission and contribute to preventing fratricide. Critical emphasis will be placed on dynamic allocation/reallocation of airspace during execution and dissemination of tailored airspace information products to all effected participants in near real time as changes occur. Anticipated prime contractor activities include studies, analyses, specification and requirements generation, design, development, integration, engineering, simulation, demonstration, exercise support, test and evaluation, quality assurance, risk management, acquisition, production, operation, installation, documentation, familiarization, and maintenance, associated with inserting JASMAD into the evolving capabilities of the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (AOC WS) and/or the JC2/GIG architectures. 

This software development effort supports the Department of Defense (DoD), Allies and Coalition Partners. It also takes the form of an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) and an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration(s) (ACTDs).    JASMAD will be designed and implemented as an information service to enhance interoperability and facilitate integration/interoperation with other AOC WS and/or JC2/GIG components.  Dependencies on other Components/Services/Agencies (C/S/A) and Allies’ systems will be minimized by emphasizing standard data, standard Airspace Control Plan (ACP) and Air Defense Plan (ADP) formats, machine-to-machine (m2m) communications, expanded ATO/ACO United States Message Text Format (USMTF) message formats, data link message formats and standards, eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) standards, new standard Geographic Information Systems (GIS), etc. JASMAD will minimize conflicts, via collaborative, distributed, airspace management (coordination) among the service components. JASMAD will enhance automated assistance to create and visualize Battle Management Areas, e.g., C2 sectors and regions; Airspace Control Measures (ACMs) and combine approved ACMs into ACOs singly or in selectable aggregates.  The necessary capability will be developed to provide solutions for real time airspace deconfliction, to include kill boxes, for all components during mission execution.  Automation support will be provided to create, and/or import, modify and implement the ACP.  Emphasis will be placed on the capability to support positive and procedural Air Traffic Control in combat, international and national civil airspace. The intended users are the Airspace Management and Planning Team and the Liaison Officers (LNOs) in the Air Operations Center (AOC) who contribute to the final airspace products and, within the UK, to the Joint Force Air Component Headquarters (JFACHQ) airspace managers.  JASMAD will assist operational level planning and will interact with the LNOs detailed planning capabilities to assimilate all pertinent airspace information for tailorable display and distribution.  JASMAD will apply advanced technology and follow spiral development and evolutionary acquisition processes to derive system capabilities and incremental releases that refine the JASMAD functional capabilities to achieve the desired end result. JASMAD will provide rapid technology advancement, insertion and integration to meet a wide variety of joint user needs.  

JASMAD will be based on approved Joint Service/USAF Doctrine, the requirements outlined in the AOC WS Command and Control Requirements Identification Database (C2RID) and the AOC WS Block 10.2 Upgrade Requirements Document: Section Airspace Management (Deconfliction).  Lessons learned from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation TELIC will be applied.  

A Joint Users Group (JUG), potentially including United Kingdom (UK) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members, will be established.  The JUG will interact with the contractor and will act as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  Liaison with the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and European Control (EUROCONTROL) will be pursued as appropriate.

For all work to be performed, the contractor shall provide flexible technical, managerial, contracting/subcontracting and business processes, compatible with the volatile nature of the defense industry and the political and operating environment.  The contractor shall accomplish the following as required in accordance with the Statement of Scope (SOS) and the requirements identified in the Annexes.

The effort will include: participating in planning and conducting the infusion and integration of software into technology experiments, demonstrations, evaluation programs and field exercises; develop test plan documentation; analyze, evaluate, and document technical data;  provide software development, maintenance, and upgrades;  provide technical project planning and coordination;  prepare and present formal and informal briefings;  attend technical meetings for the purpose of providing technical expertise.    

If ACTD(s) are approved, some overseas travel may be required. For planning purposes the duration of each trip would be up to a month. The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract.  Therefore, prospective offerors will be required at a later date to provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL.  The successful offeror must have a completed and approved DD Form 2345 prior to award.   For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Information Service at 1-888-352-9333 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to upgrade an existing Polytec Scanning Laser Vibrometer PSV-300 to the new PSV-400 system.  Researchers in the Structural Dynamics Branch are involved in measuring the vibration of a wide variety of structures.  A scanning laser vibrometer system offers the capability of measuring vibrations with zero mass loading, rapid data collection from a large array of measurement points, and insensitivity to environmental conditions.  Because the laser system acquires data at multiple points sequentially, it is imperative that the system does so very rapidly to minimize the overall measurement time, particularly for large structures.  This requires very precise and repeatable geometry control of the laser beam.  The upgrade to the PSV-400 will expand our test capability, but still be backwardly compatible with our existing software algorithms.  The new PSV-400 will significantly expand and improve our test capabilities by providing improved laser optical performance via auto focusing of the beam at each measurement location, improved signal conditioning, and most significantly by providing a geometry scan engine that is used to measure the test measurement geometry with an accuracy of better than ~1 mm at over 30 meters distance. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  Responses shall include a description that clearly explains and details how the vendor proposes to upgrade the Polytec Scanning Laser Vibrometer (PSV-300)to the new PSV-400 system. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to:  Mr. Jim Gaspar James.L.Gaspar@nasa.gov  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Mr. Lionel Nadeau Lionel.E.Nadeau@nasa.gov Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.   THERE IS NO SOLLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  I. INTRODUCTION:   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government  WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the Government.  Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  It is requested that information in response to paragraphs I-IV of this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN October 15, 2004 to Ms. Alice Tornquist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25222B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst NJ 08733 or by email at alice.tornquist@navy.mil . Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. The RFI process will be conducted as follows: (a) The information received in response to this RFI will be used for market research purposes; (b) Also, the Government will host two Industry Days on November 16-17, 2004 as detailed in Paragraph (V) below. 

II. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information on available and emerging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental test and measurement products/technologies that may potentially enable the objectives stated in paragraph (4) below.  Those responding to this request may categorize responses by identifying candidate products/technologies that currently exist, those currently under development, and those that can be planned and scheduled.  Interested parties may provide any information (specifications, brochures, product application papers, etc) on current or emerging products that address the stated objectives to the above address. The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs.

III.  BACKGROUND: Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) are working collectively to demonstrate the potential implementation of a suite of virtual and/or synthetic test instruments, currently referred to collectively as an Advanced Virtual Instrument Test System (AVITS) to provide a common Navy and Marine Corps platform for emulating General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) needed to satisfy a variety of electronic test applications at the Organizational Level (O-Level) of maintenance. It is envisioned that AVITS would provide a common hardware and software architecture that could be easily reconfigured into multiple packaging schemes to support specific O-Level maintenance test applications or to provide a required suite of GPETE.  Initial demonstration applications may include the following: (1) a GPETE emulator for use at organizational maintenance levels across the Navy and Marine Corps (Digital Multimeter, 100 MHz Oscilloscope, Frequency Counter, Signal Generator, & RF Power Meter, as a minimum), (2) the potential for automation of NAVSEA periodic maintenance procedures that traditionally require multiple manual measurements at various test points with conventional GPETE, and (3) an O-Level radio test application for support of the Navy Surface Fleet and Marine Corps Ground Forces.

IV. OBJECTIVES: The principal objectives of the AVITS concept of operations are to provide the Navy and USMC maintainer with the following:  (1) the capability to configure multiple, programmable virtual/synthetic instruments into a portable, light weight, single-standard, multiple protocol packaging scheme for use at O-Level, (2) a capability that provides an interface to distance support assistance and training applications, and (3) a system that reduces total ownership costs within the Navy and the USMC.  To further these objectives, AVITS should provide (a) “plug-and-play” instrument functionality along with self-test and self-system verification (calibration), one control/display with multiple virtual control/display panels,  (b) an integrated test executive engine that allows for automated Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) applications, and (c) the ability to collect/transmit test data in a format and language compatible with legacy maintenance data management software currently in use.  In addition, AVITS should be software upgradeable to support the emerging Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and the Automated Test Mark-up Language (ATML), based on the eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML).  These are emerging industry standards used to facilitate closed loop diagnostics by providing an interface control/data transfer standard between maintenance systems.   ATML will provide the standard software interfaces for emerging knowledge based maintenance data systems to enable integrated diagnostics.    Finally, AVITS should provide for reduced costs to outfit new construction ships sufficiently inherent configuration flexibility to allow for management of specific subsystem obsolescence, reduced personnel training costs on both the GPETE and the Prime Systems it services, reduced maintenance and calibration costs compared to the previously utilized discrete GPETE, and improved operational capability and system readiness.

V. INDUSTRY DAYS: The Government will host two industry days on November 16-17, 2004 at the Embassy Suites LAX South, 1440 E. Imperial Avenue, El Segundo, California, US, 90245.  (a) The purpose of these Industry Days is to provide interested parties a face-to-face opportunity to make the Navy and Marine Corps aware of their commercial products/technologies that they believe can potentially satisfy the objectives described in Paragraph (4) above. (b) One-hour meetings may be scheduled from 9:00 am – 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm – 4:00 pm each day.  Meetings will be held in a closed door, boardroom setting and government team members will sign non-disclosure agreements as required.  (c) Standard power, presentation boards, and a LCD projector will be provided.  Two rooms have been reserved, allowing presenters one-half hour each for set-up and tear-down.  (d) Hotel reservations may be made at the Embassy Suites by calling (310) 640-3600 and using the “AVT” reservation code. (e) Requests for participation should be emailed to alice.tornquist@navy.mil.  Requests are to include the following:  the name of the organization, perferred meeting day and time,  the technology that will briefed, point of contact, and list of  prospective attendees.  Any power or other special requirements to support a demonstration should also be identified in the request. Meeting times will be assigned on a first come, first served basis. Requests for participation must be received no later than one week prior to the date of the meeting.  (Fax number for Alice Tornquist below is corrected to read 732-323-2359.)

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Administrative Support Center has a requirement to acquire services for the expansion of an interactive website database to meet the needs of the ichthyoplankton research community for NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). This work is pursuant to the Environmental Services Data and Information Management Program (ESDIM) grant National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS-03-03): International Database for Early Life Stages of Northwestern Atlantic Fishes by Dr. Larry Massey and Dr. Bill Richards stationed at Norfolk State University. The work order is to be accomplished by the Office of Information Technology at Norfolk State University in support of the above ESDIM grant. In 1999 the SEFSC developed a website that archives basic research data and information on the early life stages of marine fishes from the western central North Atlantic Ocean. Information for the website is contributed by cooperating ichthyologists located at about twenty institutions in the United States, Mexico, England, Austrialia, and South Africa. The website in its present form is static while the cooperating research community is dynamic with new data and revisions to existing data occurring almost daily as scientists continue to apply their research. In 2002 a proposal was submitted by Dr. Larry Massey and Dr. Bill Richards and accepted by ESDIM in 2003 to overhaul the website to create an interactive website database to meet the needs of the ichtyoplankton research community. In 2003 work was conducted with partial funding from ESDIM that aimed at building a hardware and software infrastructure for the revision of existing Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file architecture into a web-compatible, searchable information database. The follow-on work for 2004 will build upon the 2003 work and will accomplish four milestones and deliverables as defined by the original ESDIM proposal. ESDIM proposal NMFS -03-03 was submitted to NOAA specifically stating that a historically minority-serving institution (HMSI) would complete the work. Norfolk State University is the seventh largest historically black college or university in the nation. The proposal also competed against other proposals submitted within NOAA and was selected on the basis of it merits and specifics. NOAA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Norfolk State University, under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any responsible firm interested in this requirement may submit its qualifications via fax to 816-426-7530, Attention: Sharon Walker. Information should reference number NFFN7020-4-00163. The DOC requires that all contractors doing business with the Government are registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all bidders must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun and Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/produc/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE REAL-TIME GAMMA-RAY SIGNATURE IDENTIFIER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's real-time gamma-ray signature identifier. 

Identification of nuclides measured by gamma-ray spectrometry is traditionally done by identifying the peaks in the unknown spectrum.  This identification usually starts with some sort of peak curve fitting.  Compton scattering of some gamma-rays causes count data to spread beyond the peak locations to the continuum. This Compton scattered part of the gamma-ray spectrum contains information about the radioactive source and the gamma-ray detector.  Shielded sources frequently contain more counts in the continuum than in the peaks, making identification difficult.  Ideally, we want to use all available information to best conclude what an unknown source was without requiring knowledge of any shielding.

Analyzing both the peaks and continuum is a full spectrum analysis.  Automating this process to run unattended on a computer is challenging because of a limited ability to model all the relevant physics for all possible sources and shields.  

LLNL has developed an approach for full spectrum analysis that uses little computer time, analyzes the full gamma-ray spectrum and can be adjusted to address numerous identification objectives.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's real-time gamma-ray signature identifier should provide a written statement of interest that includes:
1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	P.O. Box 808, L-795

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE A OPTICAL PROBE FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE A OPTICAL PROBE FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license its technology pertaining to Medical Optical Probes.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a new, minimally invasive diagnostic Optical Probe that can instantly identify abnormal tissue, including cancerous tissue. The Optical Probe removes no tissue and is expected to achieve accuracy levels comparable to surgical biopsies in detecting cancerous cells.

The optical probe assembly consists of control unit containing a laser unit, detectors, and control circuitry.  Optical fibers emerge from the unit and these optical fibers transmit light to and from the tissue thru a needle probe.   This needle probe is smaller than the needle used in routine blood tests.  The optical probe assembly also includes a reference optical fiber as part of the fiber optics, which improves the accuracy of the unit by accounting for optical source variations and changes in the fiber optic transmission efficiencies.  

The successful deployment of this optical probe could provide new, minimally invasive diagnostic tool that could instantly detect cancerous tissue, which would result in a reduction in the amount of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries.  Medical professionals estimate this would have the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system over $2 billion annually.

This device is protected by one U.S. Patent (#6647285).

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Medical Optical Probes technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD SILICON MONOLITHIC MICROCHANNEL (SiMM) LASER DIODES PACKAGES
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD SILICON MONOLITHIC MICROCHANNEL (SiMM) LASER DIODES PACKAGES

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build Silicon Monolithic Microchannel (SiMM) high average power Laser Diode Packages.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a water cooled, high average power laser diode packaging technology.   The packages use microchannels etched in silicon in close proximity to the laser bars to provide aggressive cooling (LLNL has demonstrated over 500 W/cm2 thermal dissipation capability).   The silicon platforms also permit efficient lens mounting over the laser diodes by using lens frames precisely mounted on the silicon platforms.    LLNL has these SiMM laser diode packages in production and in use on several laser systems.  The current SiMM laser diodes packages include 10 individual laser bars and are capable of handling 1.2 kilowatts of power (optical and heat).

LLNL researchers use a novel combination of technologies to fabricate the microchannel packages.   These technologies include anisotropic etching of silicon and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding.  The net result is a simple and flexible fabrication technology used to build microchannel structures.

The key to the aggressive cooling provided by the SiMM packages lies in the use of microchannels in extremely close proximity to the laser diode bar.   In particular, the use of microchannels minimizes the thermal temperature rise across the stagnant boundry layer at the silicon wall-to-water interface.  This stagnant boundary layer exists because of the ‘no slip’ boundary condition at the microchannel wall-to-water interface, which is the same physical phenomenon that allows dust to settle on rapidly turning fan blades without being blown off.  The combination of the microchannel geometry combined with smooth laminar coolant flow (promoted by the silicon channel) minimizes the thermal rise across this stagnant boundary layer.

 LLNL has three patents which pertain directly to the SiMM laser diode packages.   These patents are as follows:  Patent #5,548,605, Patent #5,828,683, and Patent #5,828,683.  These patents are available for non-exclusive licensing.



Taking advantage of the large differential etch rates between the various crystallographic directions in silicon, it is straightforward to fabricate the very high aspect ratio channels that are the key to achieving aggressive heat removal with only moderated temperature rises.  Because silicon can be conveniently bonded to glass using an anodic bonding technique, it is possible to fabricate feed plenums in one layer of silicon and microchannels in another and to join the two with a thin sheet of glass.  The cooler in Fig 1 illustrates this feature, having silicon outer layers bonded to a glass central layer.  This combination of technologies, anisotropic etching of silicon and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding, combine to give a very simple and flexible technology base from which microchannel based structures are simply fabricated.

To understand in detail how microchannels function to give unsurpassed thermal performance, it is useful to use a very simplified picture of the heat flow in a liquid flow silicon based microchannel cooling circuit, and break down the temperature rise between the heat generating component and the cold inlet cooling fluid into three different components.  The first component corresponds to the temperature rise associated with heat flowing through the solid silicon material, from the electronic component that generates heat down into the regions between the water flow channels.  The next component corresponds to the temperature rise associated with heat flowing across the stagnant boundary layer of water and into the moving fluid.  This stagnant boundary layer exists because of the ‘no slip’ boundary condition at the microchannel wall-to-water interface – this is the same physical phenomenon that allows dust to settle on rapidly turning fan blades without being blown off.  The last component corresponds to the temperature rise associated with the heat absorbed by the flowing water as it goes from the cold inlet side of the microchannels to the hot outlet side of the channels.  It turns out that the temperature rise associated with the heat flowing across the stagnant water boundary layer at the solid-to-water interface is generally the largest temperature rise in flowing water heatsink structures.  To understand this one need only consider that the thermal conductivity of a typical cooling fluid such as water at 0.0061 °C/Wth-cm, which is approximately 250 times smaller than that of silicon at room temperature.  Thus, in compact flowing water heatsink structures the biggest leverage in controlling the overall temperature rise is generally associated with minimizing the thickness of the stagnant boundary layer.  Because boundary layer thickness scales with the channel width for laminar flow through microchannels, the solid material used to construct the cooler should be one that permits easy fabrication of narrow channels.   This result explains the apparently paradoxical choice of silicon with its well developed anisotropic etching technologies as the preferred material for microchannel heatsinks over other more obvious materials with higher thermal conductivities such as copper.  More thermal performance is to be had by using a material that permits tiny microchannel fabrication rather than materials having higher thermally conductivity but that are restricted to larger channel widths due to fabrication issues.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MULTILAYER DIELECTRIC DIFFRACTION GRATINGS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR MULTILAYER DIELECTRIC DIFFRACTION GRATINGS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build Multilayer Dielectric Diffraction Gratings.

Researchers at LLNL have developed Multilayer Dielectric Diffraction Gratings for the compression and stretching of broadband laser pulses. The researchers designed the Multilayer Dielectric Diffraction Gratings to solve the need for high efficiency gratings used in reflection or transmission which could withstand the optical intensity present with high power laser systems. They are an enabling technology for the compression of high energy (>3 Joule) pulses on short pulse (<10 nanosecond) lasers.

The forming a multilayer structure of alternating index dielectric materials and placing a grating structure on top of the multilayer structure permits the fabrication of a diffraction grating of adjustable efficiency and variable optical bandwidth.  Researchers have achieved diffraction efficiencies into the first order in reflection varying between 0.1 and 98 percent by controlling the design of the multilayer and the depth, shape, and material comprising the grooves of the grating structure. Any dielectric material which exhibits low absorption at the wavelength of interest can be used to comprise the dielectric layers.   An important feature of the invention is that high diffraction efficiency can be achieved in reflection without the need for metallic coatings either overcoating the grating structure or underneath the dielectric stack.   The bandwidth selectivity, ability to control the amplitude of the light scattered into different orders and high damage threshold extends the use of these gratings to applications far beyond the pulse compression use for which the gratings were initially conceived.

This technology is covered by U.S. patent # 5907436 and is available for non-exclusive licensing.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS 
TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A HIGH POWER HEAT CAPACITY LASER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license the technology for a high power Heat Capacity Laser.  In addition, LLNL would welcome the opportunity to engage in cooperative research (CRADA) with commercial partner(s) interested in developing the technology.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a successful pulsed high energy solid state laser that produces high average output power by operating in a mode that separates the operation (heating) and cooling cycles (i.e. in a heat capacity limited regime).  Instead of employing continuous cooling, the laser operates until the active amplifier medium heats up to some maximum acceptable temperature.  This approach eliminates much of the wavefront distortion normally associated with the thermal gradients created by the cooling process.  The waste heat is temporarily accumulated in the active amplifier medium itself.  Therefore, the amount of energy the laser can put out with minimal optical wavefront distortion is proportional to its mass, the heat capacity of the active medium, and the temperature difference over which it is being operated.  Cooling takes place when the laser is not operating.

In addition, researchers at LLNL have invented a normal incidence stack architecture.  The laser design uses this architecture with diode array pumping to achieve increased power/energy per disk, a reduction in beam distortions by orders of magnitude, improved beam propagation, and improved packaging

Finally the laser technology employs a wavefront control system that operates within the laser optical cavity.  The unstable resonator design includes a deformable mirror and other control elements to optimize far field beam quality while the laser operates.  

LLNL has a tabletop laser demonstrating high average power and high beam quality.  The laser is already reaching 10-kilowatts of average power.  The ultimate goal is to produce 100-kilowatt prototypes in 2006-07.  The laser is capable of firing bursts of 500-microsecond long pulses, at a 200 Hertz repetition rate, with a 2000 to 4000 shot magazine and fast gain media exchange for reload capability.  The system is compact in design enabling  mounting on a truck (e.g. Humvee).   The system is intended for field deployment primarily against rockets, artillery and mortars but has other uses such as remote land mine uncovering and deflagration.

LLNL has one issued U.S. patent (#5526372) and several patent applications relating to this technology.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's high power Heat Capacity Laser should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

<SUBJECT>--Charrette Report/Customer Concept Document, Common Ground Systems Operation Facility Beale AFB, CA
<DESC>1.	This is not an Announcement for Solicitation.  This is a Notice of Intent to contract with CH2M Hill, an A-E firm in Sacramento, CA, on a Sole Source basis for a follow-on programming effort on the Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Operatio ns Facility at Beale AFB, CA for the following reasons. a.	CH2M Hill was previously contracted to prepare a Facility Needs Assessment for the DCGS Facility at Beale AFB.  This Needs Assessment was completed in April 2004.  It was accomplished through extensive interviews with both End Users and Base personnel, field investigations of existing conditions, review of as-built documents, preliminary load calculations, and utility surveys.  The document presents findings of the data gathering and analysis phase, evaluates alternative conceptual approaches developed t o address deficiencies and future requirements, provides the Air Force with preferred alternatives in terms of findings and recommendations for future programming.   b.	To award to a firm other than CH2M Hill for this follow-on effort would cause substantial loss of time, cost, and manpower to the Government due to unfamiliarity of the already approved Needs Assessment.  In addition, a new firm would not have the benef it of knowledge gained by past User/Base interviews and would not be able to take advantage of already established relationships with the project stakeholders.   Field investigations, utility surveys, and interviews with all User/Base personnel would have to be performed again. 2.  Specialized experience and technical competence required: (1) past experience in producing Programming Documents for Air Force projects; (2) past experience in intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance operations facilities; (3) past experience with  the design of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF). The evaluation will consider education, certifications, training, registration, awards, overall and relevant experience, knowledge of Corps of Engineers military criteria, and familiari zation with all features of the proposed project, past performance with respect to quality of work and compliance with performance schedules, knowledge of SCIF criteria, and the experience of the firm on similar projects.   3. Submission Requirements:  Firms may provide qualification information for consideration in allowing the Contracting Officer to determine alternate sources for this specialized work.  The Contracting Officer has sole discretion in making a determination to solicit other sources based on the information provided as a result of this Notice of Intent.  Submittals, in the form of an SF 330 must discuss the qualifications of your firm in relation to each of the qualifications listed above.  Limit the submissio n of the SF330 to not more than 20 pages.  A separate announcement and request for qualifications may be issued should this Notice of Intent result in responses that would reveal a more qualified source. 4.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training  Instrumentation (PEO STRI) intends to issue a solicitation for Battlefield Effect Simulators.  The U.S. Army uses pyrotechnic type Battlefield Effects Simulators (BES) within the training environment to simulate the flash and bang of weapon projectile’s discharge and impact. There are two major components in a BES: the launcher device and the cartridges used in the launcher.  The Army currently has two sets of BES requirements: one for Force-on-Force (FOF) training and the other for Live Fire Range Training, or Force-on-Target (FOT).  This requirement will be for the acquisition of FOT BES.  The  successfol FOT BES contractor(s) will be responsible for providing equipment (launcher and/or cartridges) that shall replace existing devices without degrading current capabilities and provide an expansion capability for FOT BES throughout training. Also, the resulting contract(s) will facilitate the streamline acquisition of a family of BES to include, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), and Urban Operations (UOs) applications as changing threats dictate.


The BES competition will be conducted on a unrestricted full and open competitive basis with the utilization of best value trade off procedures.  This solicitation will result in the award of an ID/IQC capable of procuring the entire family of BES products, thereby providing for a wide variety of Department of Army and other users.  The BES ID/IQC would allow for placement of individual procurement actions for BES training devices and cartridges.  The Government will reserve the right to make separate awards for the cartridge and the launcher, provided that the launcher and the cartridge are compatible. Contractors will be given flexibility to propose or not propose on individual (cartridge or launcher) aspects of contract requirements.  The North American Industry Classifiation system (NAICS) Class Code is 333319.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  The  draft RFP N61339-04-R-0055 will be available electronically at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=stricom&men=OPA on or about 1 September 2004.

The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for any  Bid & Proposals (B&P) costs for offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP. Please direct all correspondence to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Barbara Y. Ladd at (407)380-4099 or email: Barbara.Ladd@peostri.army.mil and Contract Specialist, Ms. Nikia Jelks at (407)380-4945 or email: Nikia.S.Jelks@peostri.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-04-324, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 Employees.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has a requirement to purchase a Subscription Service to facilitate and consolidate the purchase, delivery, and management of journals, books, trade magazines, and other periodicals as may be required by all on-campus laboratories of the NIDDK.  This service will be used mainly to facilitate tracking, canceling, and ordering of current, expiring, and new upcoming requirements for journals and other periodicals.  This service will be for a total of up to five years, consisting of a base year with four sequential option years.  

Detailed technical specifications are as follows:


I. Background

Scientific journals and other serial subscriptions are required by The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Division of Intramural Research (subsequently cited as NIDDK) in order to provide a means of communicating and widely distributing new scientific theories, experiments, and technologies, as well as communicating general and field specific discussions on advanced scientific issues. Scientific journals, magazines, proceeding publications and other written serial subscriptions are the widely accepted tool for publishing scientific achievements or results. 

It is intended that a serial subscription provider (subsequently cited as the Vendor) be awarded a purchase order to provide all required full serial subscription services for one serial subscription delivery year, beginning January 1, 2006, with an option of four additional delivery years. In order to provide a reasonable amount of time to contact publishers and to provide the government its quote, the period of performance will begin each August 1 prior to the start of each serial subscription delivery year. NIDDK defines the serial subscription delivery year to begin the first day of January and end the last day of December. NIDDK may request new subscriptions, title cancellations, and address changes at any time during the performance period or the serial subscription delivery year but all subscriptions should expire December 31 of any year ordered, excluding titles that have been canceled prior to December 31.  NIDDK currently has serial subscription services provided by EBCSO. Any vendor awarded this requirement must be able to renew or reorder all current NIDDK serials, as well as any new titles with no delay or break in the current delivery service, and be able to begin serial subscription delivery for all titles on January 1, 2006. 

II. Technical Requirements for Submission of RFQ and Evaluation

Initial Government Responsibilities:

•	NIDDK guarantees a total of 300 delivered journals as a minimum requirement for each serial subscription delivery year and a maximum quantity requirement of 1200. 
•	NIDDK will provide any vendor the master list of currently ordered serial titles with the quantity required and sorted by delivery address in order for each vendor to prepare price quotes.
•	A purchase order will be awarded to the vendor that can renew all of NIDDK’s currently ordered subscription titles at the lowest overall price, taking past performance, ability to provide all needed subscription services, and all other technical factors into account. 

 Government Responsibilities After Award:

•	After award of the purchase order, NIDDK will revise the master list to include any title additions or deletions, as well as any delivery address changes and submit it to the vendor by November 1, 2005.

Initial Vendor Responsibilities:

•	Each vendor must prepare and submit a separate quote for each NIDDK delivery address that clearly states the title of each subscription, the cost of each subscription, the delivery time-frame of each title (quarterly, monthly, etc.), the cumulative service charge for each designated delivery address, and whether the publisher allows for refunds of early cancellations.
•	A one-page cover sheet must be included on top of the package of delivery address quotes that clearly states the total cost for subscriptions and the total cost of service charges.  
•	Any vendor that submits the initial price quote that does not include all current NIDDK serial subscription titles must clearly state which titles have been omitted on a separate list and sort the omitted title list by delivery address. A quote submitted that does not include every current NIDDK serial subscription title will be deemed non-compliant. 
•	A statement must be included with each vendor’s quote that clearly describes the vendor’s capability of meeting all requirements as discussed in the Statement of Work.





Initial Vendor Responsibilities After Award:

•	After award, the vendor will await the revised delivery address list from NIDDK prior to placing final orders with publishers.
•	The vendor will receive the revised subscription list from NIDDK by November 1, 2005. 
•	The vendor will use this revised list as the final master subscription list for the delivery year. The Vendor must perform all required tasks needed to order and guarantee that all subscriptions begin delivery to the correct delivery addresses on January 1, 2006, with no delay or break in service from the previous delivery year subscriptions.
•	The vendor will prepare and submit to NIDDK an amended confirmation report for each NIDDK delivery address that clearly states the title of each subscription, the cost of each subscription, the delivery time-frame of each title (quarterly, monthly, etc.), the cumulative service charge for each designated delivery address and whether the publisher allows for refunds of early cancellations. A one-page cover sheet must be included on top of the package of delivery address reports that clearly states the total cost for subscriptions and the total cost of service charges. This amended final confirmation report must be returned to NIDDK by December 1, 2005. This report will act as confirmation that all titles have been ordered and that all subscriptions will begin January 1, 2006, with no delay or break in service from previous subscriptions.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Geospiza, Inc. for a Finch Software and Hardware Upgrade, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-40019.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 dated 6/18/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511 and the small business size is $21.0.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Contributing to this goal is the performance of DNA sequence analysis for clonal constructs up to pathogen genome sequencing projects. The RML contains high throughput DNA sequencers that can generate 100,000s of sequenced bases per day. Approximately seventy-six(76) researchers at RML and Bethesda, MD, use the current RML Finch Suite of Programs to manage, track and analyze their DNA sequence information.  Thirty-four(34) of these seventy-six(76) researchers are new in the last year.  It is critical that the current software and hardware components of the Finch data tracking system be upgraded to meet current and future needs.  This statement of work deals specifically with the software upgrades and hardware installations of this effort. SCHEDULE: The contractor shall provide to NIAID RML services to provide the following: 1) Provide software upgrades that will include a whole genome grid system with automated assemblies plus back-up and archival support, 2) Provide expertise in software configuration and set-up, along with data transfer and data processing, 3) Provide backup and archival solutions for backing up data for archival storage and retrieval, 4) Provide management of the entire installation of hardware and software for this upgrade process, 5) Provide on-site training, installation and integration of the software and hardware upgrades pursuant to this effort.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; propo sals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  The TRADOC Analysis Command- White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR) is a large analytic organization supporting the Armys major transformation efforts.  TRAC-WSMR has developed ad-hoc m ethods to handle the data from simulation models which evaluate the performance of Army and Joint systems including but not limited to weapons systems, sensors, vehicles, and command-and-control systems.  As the Army Transformation Roadmap is implemented, the mission of WSMR will increasingly include analyzing components of complex multi-component systems, including components and subsystems of the Future Combat System (FCS).  The increasing complexity of the networked force and systems of systems approach is resulting in increasingly large output data files, exceeding 32GB. The challenges of analyzing these large amounts of data requires TRAC-WSMR to look towards industry for more efficient enterprise-wide solutions which combine database engine, large stor age capability and analytical software which enables analysis of data in micro or macro level details. This Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) capability will need to create and manage multidimensional data sets for analysis and viewing by the user who se eks an understanding of what the data is really saying.  Any enterprise solution will need to incorporate advanced tools, e.g. data mining to help discover relationships, make choices and predictions, and improve user defined processes from the large data sets. We have a requirement for efficient enterprise-wide solutions, which combine database engine, large storage capability and analytical software, which enables analysis of data in micro or macro level details.  This Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) capabi lity will need to create and manage multidimensional data sets for analysis and viewing by the user who seeks an understanding of what the data is really saying.  Any enterprise solution will need to incorporate advanced tools, e.g., data mining to help di scover relationships, make choices and predictions, and improve user defined processes from the large data sets.

The Government will evaluate your submissions and select the systems that appear to be viable for our needs.  The vendors whose systems are selected will be required go demonstrate their system during the week of 20 Sep 2004.  You will be no tified NLT 3:00 pm MDT on 14 September 2004 if you have been selected to continue in the competition, date and time of your demonstration, the evaluation criteria for final selection and provided a form for your final prices.

Introduction
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the lead administrative natural resource trustee for natural resource restoration arising out of the  April 7, 2000 pipeline rupture at Pepco’s Chalk Point Generating Facility in Aquasco, Maryland.  The spill released about 140,000 gallons of oil into the Patuxent River and associated shoreline areas.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 authorizes designated Natural Resource Trustees (Trustees) to collect damages from the responsible parties in order to restore the injured natural resources. Along with NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Trustees.
Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree settling the claims of the United States and state of Maryland for natural resource damages, monies were provided to the Trustees to undertake specific restoration projects. (United States v. Potomac Electric Power Co.) One of those projects entailed creation of a five acre oyster sanctuary known as the Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project. The oyster sanctuary is intended to partially compensate for lost ecological services to fish, shellfish, benthic communities, and birds. An entity within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Restoration Center (RC), has been designated as the lead implementing trustee for this project on behalf of the Trustees 
The project consists of using a site named Kitt’s Marsh on historical oyster bottom within the Patuxent River in the area between Broomes Island and Sheridan Point.  Final site selection was determined by NOAA and Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) staff, using available scientific information, collaboration with scientists and local watermen, and a public meeting process before the site was formally designated as a sanctuary. 
The project consists of different individual sequential components.  Suitability of the site was documented and analyzed through the use of bottom mapping and profiling technologies.  The site was planted with about a 4-inch layer of dredged oyster shell and fines to prepare it to receive spat-on-shell oyster seed.  Eyed larvae were set on clean oyster shell and planted on the bottom throughout the 5-acre site.  Post-planting monitoring, to include both bathymetric mapping and biological sampling, will be conducted to evaluate project success and determine the need for potential corrective actions.
This Statement of Work is limited to that portion of the work-plan requiring biological monitoring of the site for oyster survival, growth, density, biomass, disease, and related water quality parameters. 
Background
The goal of the restoration project is to create a functional oyster reef sanctuary, and there are strict monitoring requirements to ensure a minimum density of live oysters on the reef throughout the life of the project.  The project has the potential to benefit from natural spatset in subsequent years if it is located in high enough salinity, but higher salinities in downriver locations could also leave the project more vulnerable to either Dermo and/or MSX disease.
Requirements
The contractor shall provide monitoring services according to the following schedule.  Actual tasks within each scheduled sampling event are defined in detail below
Event 1	Year 0- 2004	(Fall)		Biological, Disease, and Water Quality 
Event 2a	Year 1- 2005	(Spring)	Biological and Water Quality sampling
Event 2b	Year 1- 2005	(Summer)	Disease and Water Quality sampling
Event 3	Year 1- 2005	(Fall)		Biological, Disease, and Water Quality
Event 4a	Year 2- 2006	(Spring)	Biological and Water Quality sampling
Event 4b	Year 2- 2006	(Summer)	Disease and Water Quality sampling		
Event 5	Year 2- 2006	(Fall)		Biological, Disease, and Water Quality
Event 6a	Year 3- 2007	(Spring)	Biological and Water Quality sampling
Event 6b	Year 3- 2007	(Summer)	Disease and Water Quality sampling
Event 7	Year 3- 2007	(Fall)		Biological, Disease, and Water Quality
Event 8	Year 4- 2008	(Fall)		Biological, Disease, and Water Quality
Fall is defined as October-November, Spring is defined as late April-May, and Summer is defined as July-early August.
This SOW consists of a total of 8 complete sampling events (noting that the spring and summer events are separated into two phases to document distinct monitoring criteria)
The sampling schedule under the initial restoration plan would continue outward through the lifespan of the project to include the following sampling events (noted for planning purposes only, not a portion of this contract).  

Requirements of Each sampling event:
Water Quality
Water Quality sampling shall consist of bottom sampling dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature during each site visit (a minimum of 5 replicate readings from within the project site shall be taken).  The Contractor shall analyze the temperature and salinity data in relation to data from nearby long-term monitoring stations in place in the Patuxent River to determine any causative factors due to water quality (if such stations remain in place through adequate funding).
Biological sampling shall consist of:

Abundance 
At the time the oysters were planted, accurate DGPS marks were made on the corners of the ground so that future sampling efforts will be conducted in the right area. These marks will be provided to the Contractor. The contractor will then provide divers to collect samples to monitor oyster abundance according to the schedule.   At least 10 and up to 20 random points will be sampled widely over the 5-acre planted area during the first sampling period using .33-m2 quadrats, and a minimum of ten  random points will be sampled within the project area during each subsequent sampling period. 
Divers will remove all materials from within each quadrat including oysters, cultch, boxes and any other material found in the quadrat, and place them in a mesh catch bag.  If abundance is low (mean <5 oysters or spat/quadrat ) then additional grabs may be  collected.  The bags will be brought to the surface for examination. All oysters, including boxes and scars will be counted and recorded.  Data reported will be number/m2  -based on size classes, including live, and boxes, and scars for spat.  Up to 100 live oysters and 100 boxes or scars will be measured and recorded, with no more than 25 from each quadrat.
Size and Mortality
The Contractor will measure the length from the bill to the umbo of up to 50 oysters from each sample to determine size. (See previous paragraph.) The difference in mean length between sampling periods will provide an estimate of growth, and the difference in mean density between sampling periods will estimate mortality. Mortality can also be derived by the increase in box counts, but since boxes eventually disarticulate, the change in density is a more accurate estimate of mortality.
Disease 
During summer and fall sampling events, the Contractor will collect a minimum of 5  oysters from each quadrat sample to be analyzed for the prevalence of Perkinsus marinus (Dermo) and intensity on a modified Mackin scale of 0 to 7. Regardless of the number of quadrats sampled during any sampling period, a total of 30 oysters will be randomly selected for analysis.   Samples will be tested with the RFTM method (Ray, 1966). When very small, this will be almost whole-body analysis. As the oysters grow larger (>1 inch), the standard rectal tissue assay will be used. 
Biomass
The contractor will also provide a biomass (regression estimate) for the project site, using the site-specific size-class and abundance data and the regression curve established for Patuxent River oysters, in order to evaluate reef biomass over the life of the project. This will be based on lengths and whole weights of sampled oysters.
Reef Structure
During each site visit, the Contractor shall make and record qualitative visual observations as to the overall contiguous structure of the project site.  This evaluation is intended to analyze general characteristics including site fouling by epibethic organism communities, sedimentation and shell embeddedness, vertical accretion of reef height from shell formation, etc.  The Contractor shall present these results as part of the reports following each site visit.
Deliverables and Schedule
The contract total deliverable consists of 8 complete sampling events (note three events have two components each for a total of 11 site visits) according to the dates specified within the monitoring schedule.  The contractor shall provide a complete trip report, including summary water quality parameters, size-classed abundance/density analysis, and disease results within 60 days of each site visit. These reports are envisioned to be summary (2-3 pages) in nature, with detailed numerical data available upon request if project success is compromised or contingency benchmarks are reached.

Para 2.11, Replication and Packaging:  What are the packaging  requirements? A.

Section C: Volunteers-In-Parks (VIP) Recognition Items Specifications/Statement of Work Purpose The purpose of this contract is to provide the National Park Service's Volunteers-In-Parks (VIP) with newly designed insignia including patches, pins, and stickers. These items usually serve as part of the uniform for the Volunteers-In-Parks program. There are currently 121,000 volunteers servicewide who provide 4.5 million hours per year of service to the parks and the public. These items provide uniformity within the program and are recognizable to the public. Background: The National Park Service VIP program was enacted by Congress in 1970. For over 30 years, one patch design has been used. To bring the program into the new millennium and to keep it fresh, a new logo/insignia incorporating a newly updated NPS arrowhead logo has been designed. This new design will be used for all VIP items such as patches, pins, stickers, and printed materials for the foreseeable future. There are 387 sites in the National Park System, 350 of which have active VIP programs. With increased attention to the program and general interest in volunteerism, volunteer numbers and hours have been increasing. Providing volunteers with the proper uniform acknowledges the volunteer's participation in the program and serves as recognition for the public. Patches, pins, and stickers are used on a variety of clothing/accessory items as uniforms to outfit volunteers throughout the National Park Service. Uniform clothing items vary from park to park depending on factors such as climate and type of work. The uniform items that represent the Volunteers-In-Parks program servicewide are the patch and pin and should be of the highest quality.   Specifications: Patch: There are two distinct designs that represent the National Park Service Volunteers-In-Parks program. The first is the general VIP patch pictured below that is given to all volunteers. This patch is required in two different sizes: 3 1/4" shoulder size and 2 ¼" cap size. These are sewn onto garments and should have a thread count of 7,000-10,000 stitches per shoulder patch and 4,000-7,000 per cap patch (this is an approximation). All patches are 100% stitched with a stitched gold border as shown. Thread colors should match PMS colors shown below as closely as possible as thread colors are not normally referred to in PMS standards. All patches must be finished with sizing and no loose or hanging threads. Thickness should be reflective of maximum quality.  (Picture of patch is not available through FBO.  Please e-mail to: cheryl_a_drake@nps.gov for picture and additional specifications.) The second patch is the Master Volunteer Ranger patch pictured below that is given to those who commit to 500 hours of service per year and/or provide specialized skills to the Service with regards to specific projects. This patch is required only in the shoulder size. These are sewn onto garments and should have a thread count of 7000-10,000 stitches per patch (this is an approximation). All patches are 100% stitched with a stitched gold border as shown. Thread colors should match PMS colors shown below as closely as possible as thread colors are not normally referred to in PMS standards. All patches must be finished with sizing and no loose or hanging threads. Thickness should be reflective of maximum quality.  (Picture of patch is not available through FBO.  Please e-mail to: cheryl_a_drake@nps.gov for picture and additional specifications.) Take Pride in America rocker: The Take Pride in America rocker is meant to be displayed below the VIP shoulder patch to reflect the agency participation in this Presidential Initiative. This rocker will be sewn on below the VIP patch with a thread count of 4,000-7,000 stitches per patch. All patches are 100% stitched with a stitched gold border as shown. Thread colors should match PMS colors shown below as closely as possible as thread colors are not normally referred to in PMS standards. All patches must be finished with sizing and no loose or hanging threads. Thickness should be reflective of maximum quality.  Picture of patch is not available through FBO.  Please e-mail to: cheryl_a_drake@nps.gov for picture and additional specifications.) Lapel Pin: The lapel pin resembles the general VIP patch and is required in one size shown below. This is a two-dimensional metal pin (gold-tone.) with a pinch-back military fastener. Areas shown below in white will be raised and gold-toned metal. Picture of pin is not available through FBO.  Please e-mail to: cheryl_a_drake@nps.gov for picture and additional specifications.) Sticker:   The sticker resembles the general VIP patch and is required in one size shown below. It is made of standard white vinyl with 5 colors. This decal should have an adhesive backing with a life of at least 5 years. Stickers can be produced in sheets of peel-off stickers. 12 stickers per 8 ½ x 11 sheet. Picture of sticker is not available through FBO.  Please e-mail to: cheryl_a_drake@nps.gov for picture and additional specifications.) Statutory and Regulatory Protection: The Service's authority to protect the arrowhead symbol is found in section 701 of title 18 of the United States Code. This law prohibits the unauthorized manufacture, sale or possession of "any badge, identification card, or other insignia" of any department or agency of the United States, and forbids the manufacture of any "engraving, photograph, print or impression of any such badge, identification card, or other insignia." In addition, the arrowhead is protected by the trademark laws of the United States as a service mark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and by 36 CFR 11, which prohibits commercial use of the symbol unless permitted by the Director. Copied from Director's Order #52. Packaging and Marking Items are to be shrink-wrapped or bagged in sleeves of 50 and boxed together. Stickers are printed in sheets of 12 and may ship as individual sheets or in packs of 10. Sticker sheets should be packaged and/or shipped with a protective cardboard backing to prevent bending or folding. There are an estimated 30 parks that will be receiving quantities less than 50 of some or all items. Shipment is to be made all at once. No backorders. Boxes will be shipped to the park/region VIP Coordinator. This will be noted on the shipping label. All items will be delivered to each NPS site on a drop-ship basis. Addresses willl be provided upon award.  Inspection and Acceptance: Twenty (20) business days after award, the vendor shall submit a first article sample of each item prior to full manufacturing and delivery of the items. The government shall have 15 business days to inspect the items.  Upon written acceptance by the Contracting Officer, the vendor shall commence full manufacturing of the items and delivery will be in accordance with the delivery schedule below. Ten random samples from different package lots will be sent to the Washington office for inspection. Items will be inspected by the Washington office prior to shipment to the field. The government will contact the vendor within 5 business days if there are rejected lot samples. The vendor and the government will determine the best course of action depending on the extent of the problem. Confirmation of fixes agreed to by both the vendor and the Washington office will be confirmed in writing via fax or phone call to keep the process moving. There is a two-step process for inspection: 1) initial order of entire lot, and 2) drop-shipment reviewed at parks. The government shall have 15 business days to inspect all items delivered by the contractor. The government shall return rejected items within 15 days of receipt of items, through regular mail. The vendor shall have 15 business days from receipt of rejected items to replace items. Replaced items will be shipped overnight to the park site at vendor expense.   Minor defects such as 1 or 2 loose threads on the front of patches or minor scratches on the front of pins may be accepted at a 15% discount.  Rejection of items during inspection of initial order is due to: 1)	Manufacturer defect 2)	Pulled threads on front or back 3)	Die cuts off center 4)	Product is not a match of sample 5)	Substitution of thread weight, color, and/or design without consent 6)	Missing pin or pin back or bent, scratched materials. Rejection of items inspected by park on receipt of drop shipment 1)	Incorrect (too many) quantity 2)	Torn or damaged item 3)	Incorrect item 4)	Major defect, such as gashes and/or scratches, dents, or bent materials. Delivery Schedule: Initial delivery shall be 60 days after award of contract. Delivery will be made once.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 002 - The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is soliciting quotations from vendors for Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) Solution in 330 gallon totes, in accordance with BEP specification C: SLS-1, dated June 30, 2004.  DISPOSABLE TOTE CONTAINERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The 330 gallon tote containers are to be returned to the vendor.  Arrangements for the return of the tote containers shall be on a basis of a minimum of 3 tote containers per return shipment.  Return costs for the empty tote containers must be quoted as a separate item.  The solicitation number is RFQ-04-0731 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 24.  This acquisition is total small business set-aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325188.  In accordance with FAR Part 19.102(f), any concern submitting a bid or offer in its own name, that proposes to furnish an end product it did not manufacture (a nonmanufacturer), is a small business if it has no more than 500 employees, and (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(4) through (f)(7) of this section, in the case of Government acquisitions set-aside for small businesses, furnishes in the performance of the contract, the product of a small business manufacturer or producer. The end product furnished must be manufactured or produced in the United States or its outlying areas. The term nonmanufacturer includes a concern that can, but elects not to, manufacture or produce the end product for the specific acquisition. For size determination purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end product being acquired. The manufacturer of the end product being acquired is the concern that, with its own forces, transforms inorganic or organic substances including raw materials and/or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product. However, see the limitations on subcontracting at 52.219-14 that apply to any small business offeror other than a nonmanufacturer for purposes of set-asides and 8(a) awards. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.     Therefore, all interested small business manufacturers and small business distributors/resellers that meet the requirement herein are requested to submit a written quotation, which will be considered by the agency.  This notice constitutes the only solicitation; a written request for quotation will not be issued.  Delivery terms are F.O.B. Destination to the BEP Landover Warehouse, 3201 Pennsy Drive, Landover, Maryland 20785-1603.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0003 is to respond to vendor questions received to date on Solicitation SP4700-04-R-0029.   QUESTION #7:   This statement:  Only Sun iForce Partners will be considered.  This is a restraint of trade.  SUN systems products and support can be acquired on the open market.  Please revise your specifications on the opportunity to reflect such.  ANSWER:  Unauthorized Sun resellers can not meet the requirements of this bid---to provide a valid Solaris license, standard warranty of Sun gear by Sun personnel, and the legal transfer of Sun intellectual property.  Sun requires the government to purchase from a "Sun Government System Provider."  This is the only way to properly transfer Solaris licenses, Warranty, and other intellectual property associated with the hardware is to buy this way. A Government Systems Provider (GSP) contract is executed between Sun and the VAR.  There are significant terms and conditions (as well as indemnifications clauses) that protect the investment as a customer that these VARs sign up to. Any company can get on the list.  If you have not purchased products through one of Suns GSPs you are not properly acquiring the Solaris license, Warranty, and other intellectual property associated with the hardware.  The Sun GSP contract only allows for ONE tier of transfer (directly to a government customer).  The government will not be licensed properly for Sun software and would incur an additional charge; the standard warranty would also be void.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

During Country Manager Hardy’s July 2004 business development trip to China, he had the opportunity to meet with the Chairman of the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association about potential support for a number of development petrochemical/energy projects that range from coal bed methane extraction and power production to coal liquefaction and oxidation.  During that meeting, the Chairman committed to identifying specific projects, hosting the DM consultant and providing a team of experts to accompany the consultant into the field.
	
As background, China's chemical industry includes chemical extraction, and production of fertilizers, pesticides, basic inorganic raw materials, and basic organic raw materials among others.  China is a world leader in the output of more than 10 varieties of chemicals, such as synthetic ammonia, chemical fertilizers, sulphuric acid, and soda ash.  Significantly, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian and Shenyang are China's most important chemical industry bases with China exporting such products to more than 100 countries and regions.  Further, China's energy industry, including thermal, hydro and nuclear power, has developed rapidly over the past 15 years.  In the 1990s, China's installed capacity increased from 100 million kw to 200 million kw, and its generated energy and installed capacity both ranked second in the world.  This type of expansion provides a number of opportunities for U.S. companies to engage China in the development of future projects.

China has placed a high priority on developing its electric power sector ever since the unification of the country in 1949.  Planners in China recognized early on that the country needed to industrialize to support its huge population, and that the availability of reliable electric power was essential for building an industrial base.  In 1949, China had only 
1850 MW of generating capacity.  By 1980, the installed capacity had increased to 
65,870 MW, and China was becoming an important source of industrial goods on world markets. 

The policies of the past 20 years have resulted in the expansion of its generating capacity to 318,640 MW, making China the second largest power producer in the world.  It has also resulted in numerous technical advances, including the introduction of nuclear power, fluidized bed combustion, super critical pressure thermal plants, and high-efficiency emissions control systems.  Recently, China has focused on reforming the structure of its power industry to improve economic efficiency and make it more responsive to the needs of its consumers. 

As a result, the Chinese market for new power generation equipment is now the second largest in the world, trailing only the United States.  If current trends continue, it will exceed the U.S. market before the end of this decade.  This increasing need for plant components will largely be met by China’s rapidly expanding power equipment industry. However, there will also be significant opportunities for U.S. exporters to supply equipment in China.  The areas of opportunity will be predominately in very large coal fired plants, gas turbines, and projects involving newly developed technologies, such as integrated gasification combined cycle and coal bed methane production.  However, the principal issue in the energy and petrochemical sectors is access. This includes:

-	Access to major investment opportunities, such as integrated upstream development, natural gas transmission facilities, liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities, power plants, refineries, and petrochemical plants.

-	Access to markets and end-use customers in refining and marketing sectors and petrochemicals.

-	Access to data for better risk evaluation. Increased access would help develop the Chinese economy through the application of advanced technology and management practices, increase foreign investment, and increase employment opportunities for Chinese citizens.


Along with policies limiting access, many of the difficulties within this sector are commercial and legal.  They include issues such as transparency, protection of intellectual property, dispute resolution, and rule of law.  
 
As a result, the Definitional Mission consultant will pay particular attention to areas where U.S. firms are best positioned to compete in the Chinese market for the sale of goods and services in the energy/petrochemical sectors.

China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association

The CPCIA is a newly established trade association that is responsible for strengthening the exchange between government and enterprise and developing international cooperation to promote technological advancement within the industry.  The goals of the CPCIA can best be summarized as:  strengthen industrial regulations; develop proposals for changes to economic policy and legislation to support enterprise; participate in industrial planning, including the pre-feasibility of major projects; and participate in market construction.  The CPCIA currently represents 265 members companies within China.
