<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the ARC ProtectiveServices Contract for an additional ten months; said extension will consist of a onethree (3) month performance period and seven (7) one-month option periods, the exerciseof which will be determined by the Government on a monthly basis. A modificationreflecting this extension will be issued on May 31, 2009, being the expiration date ofthe current protective services contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04CI14T, which wasawarded as a result of full and open competition under a GSA Schedule to SecTek, Inc., onJune 1, 2004. This extension is required due to a Protest filed on September 17, 2008, inthe United States Court of Federal Claims challenging  NASAs agency-wide contractawarded on May 20, 2008 for protection services (i.e.,security guard services potential fire/fighting/prevention services, and potential emergency medical responseservices) to be provided at NASA/ARC and thirteen different locations located across theUnited States.	Authorization of this extension has been issued by NASA Headquartersunder PIC-04, which provides a class deviation from the requirements of FAR 17.204(e) andNFS 1817.204(e)(iii), which limit the terms of service contracts to five (5) years,including the basic contract and all options.  This class deviation applies only toexisting contracts containing requirements that will ultimately be provided under the NASA Protective Services Contract (NPSC) when the NSPC protest is resolved. The NSPC isexpected to be available for use in the near future. NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Because SecTek possesses unique expertise in meeting the securityrequirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequately provide for themaintenance of the Centers comprehensive security program during this brief period ofextension.   Award to another source when the agency-wide contract for protectiveservices has been recently awarded, and while the resolution of the protest is nearingcompletion, would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that isnot expected to be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays infulfilling the agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 14, 2009. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May14, 2009.

This solicitation will result in multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) (also known as a task order contracts), performance based service contracts spanning approximately five (5) years.

The intent of this contract is to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing and/or rearranging the existing fuel loading on selected project areas located on Malheur, Umatilla, Wallowa-Whitman and Ochoco National Forests.  All biomass that is removed will be sold to industry.

The resultant contracts will be firm-fixed price task order service contracts with provisions for timber removal.  The solicitation will be available approximately May 26, 2009.

A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled.  It is anticipated this conference will be held on or around     June 8, 2009 and the exact date and time will be designated in the solicitation.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition intends to solicit on a sole source basis with the National Asian Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse (NAPAFASA), 340 East Second Street, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90012, for further development and refinement of the mentoring program and other activities to increase the involvement of underrepresented and other scholars interested in substance abuse and addiction research in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) populations. AA/PI are severely underrepresented in both the social and basic sciences. To begin to address this issue the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established the Special Populations Office (SPO) to encourage and support persons from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in substance abuse and addiction research. NIDA convened the AA/PI to provide recommendations on research needed to better understand, prevent and treat substance abuse and addiction in AA/PI populations and to develop addiction research capacity development in AA/PI communities.</p>
<p>Underrepresented minority researchers face a number of challenges that influence their success in obtaining sponsored support from NIDA/NIH and other federal funding agencies. Some of these challenges include limited/poor mentoring, lack of knowledge of funding opportunities and requirements, and limited resources. Additional barriers for AA/PI populations include the low number of AA/PI students in the research pipeline, the scarcity of AA/PI research scientists who can serve as mentors, and skepticism held by the community towards research and government sponsored programs. Collectively, these factors impact NIDA's efforts to increase and retain AA/PI investigators conducting substance abuse and addiction research and further develop the research infrastructure within Indian country.</p>
<p>Scientific mentoring is a valuable method that serves to promote interest in research as well as retain scientists already in the research pipeline. The Asian American/Pacific Islander Researchers and Scholars Workgroup began the development of services to provide mentorship and research exposure to early/new scientists interested in pursuing careers in substance abuse and addiction research. The NAPAFASA participates in the Mentoring Program. In addition, NAPAFASA provides regular meetings to the AA/PI community, especially in the substance abuse and addiction research.</p>
<p>The contract will be used to provide the following deliverables:</p>
<p>&bull; Host periodic planning conference calls between AA/PI members, NIDA staff, and/or mentees</p>
<p>&bull; Convene a research and science meeting for early career investigators</p>
<p>&bull; Culturally appropriate website development to provide general information on the drug abuse in the AA/PI communities</p>
<p>&bull; Support the attendance at annual Researchers and Scholars Joint Workgroup meetings held in the Washington, DC area.</p>
<p>The final product will consist of:</p>
<p>&bull; A report describing the research and science meeting for early career investigators including meeting objectives, activities, collaborations, outcomes, lessons learned, major barriers, major achievements and recommendations<br />&bull; Evaluation assessments or reports from program participants regarding their activities, expectations, benefits, and continuing needs. <br />&bull; Reports from members containing recommendations for further goals and activities<br />&bull; A report that includes website URL and describes site content and user data</p>
<p><br />The period of performance will be 12 months. NIDA will have the opportunity to extend this contract, up to two additional option years.</p>
<p><br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI1018558 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Susan Nsangou, Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis a Bistim Setup for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation from Jali Medical, Inc., located at 500 West Cummings Park, Suite 4950, Woburn, MA 01801. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 423450 and the business size standard is 100 employees. <br />The NINDS Human Cortical Physiology and Stroke Neurorehabilitation (HCPSN) Section conducts clinical and research studies on normal volunteers and patients with neuromuscular disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is the use of rapidly changing magnetic fields to induce electric fields in the brain by electromagnetic induction. This is accomplished by holding a wire coil encased in plastic over the head. When the coil is energized by the rapid discharge of a large capacitor a rapidly changing current flows in its windings. This produces a magnetic field oriented orthogonally to the plane of the coil. The magnetic field passes through the skin and bone of the head, inducing current in the structure of the brain and activates nearby nerve. TMS is delivered as a single pulse or paired pulses with a short inter-stimulus interval. This is one of the techniques used to understand how cortical inhibition works and how the brain functions in controlling and planning movement is transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Bistim Setup manufactured by the Magstim Company in the UK provides the scientists and researchers at the HCPSN with the ability to deliver monophasic single and paired-pulse TMS. This device combines two single units to deliver fully programmable paired-pulse stimulation through a single stimulating coil. The power level of each pulse can be controlled independently for sub and supra-threshold conditioning and for secondary pulses to investigate inhibitory and facilitatory circuits. Inter-stimulus intervals range from 1ms to 99.9 ms in 0.1ms increments. The remote control coil allows the investigator to trigger the stimulus and change the stimulus intensity without having to reach over to the power unit; this is extremely helpful, as the individual has to hold the coil over the same spot on the head throughout the experiment. <br />The TMS devices are not sold to the general public and can only be used in research protocols. The NINDS/HCPSN Section has several ongoing protocols in need of a Bistim setup consisting of a Bistim Module and 2 Magstim 200 units with stimulating coils. The devices currently in use in the HCPSN Section are past their warranty and frequently break down which cause delay and disruption to the ongoing experiments.<br />In order to maintain compatibility with ongoing studies/experiments, it is critical for the HCPSN Section to acquire the Bistim setup manufactured by the Magstim Company based in the UK and Jali Medical Inc. is the sole distributor in the US for this equipment. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Office of Acquisitions, NIDA, on or before 11:00 AM ET May 19, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 on or before May 14, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

The SSAT will be capable of being launched from ashore, at sea or by air and will be remotely controlled utilizing the System for Navy Target Control (SNTC). 

The Navy is considering making a competitive solicitation for the limited development and refinement of an existing target system to achieve Navy requirements to facilitate follow-on production. This late-stage Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort is envisioned to commence in the FY-10 timeframe. Follow-on production is desired in FY-12. Production is currently envisioned to cover a fifteen year period at a rate of approximately 45 or more vehicles per year.

Per the SSAT FedBizOpps announcement on 13 January 2009, the United States Navy stated its plans to update the 16 October 2008 released draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in consideration of additional requirements.  This revised RFP will include a classified portion requiring potential bidders to obtain the required security clearance prior to being granted access to the classified material. The classified portion is not included in this draft of the RFP. The classified portions of the draft RFP are planned for release in June 2009.  

A copy of the RFP may be found at www.navair.navy.mil under the heading of "Doing Business With Us". Industry comments to this release of the draft RFP are encouraged and may be submitted via email to Frank Fisher at francis.fisher @navy.mil. It is requested that comments be submitted by 30 June 2009.

After review of Industry comments, the United States Navy plans to hold a pre-proposal conference, followed by the release of the final RFP in September 2009.  The specific pre-proposal conference and final RFP dates will be determined upon review of industry comments to the full draft RFP package

BIDDER ACCESS TO THE CLASSIFIED PORTIONS OF THE DRAFT RFP AND FINAL RFP IS CONTINGENT ON OBTAINING THE REQUIRED SECURITY CLEARANCE.  THE CLEARANCE PROCESS IS ESTIMATED TO TAKE UP TO 5 MONTHS.  INTERESTED BIDDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BEGIN THE SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE UNITED STATES NAVY DOES NOT INTEND TO DELAY RELEASE OF EITHER THE DRAFT OR FINAL RFP AWAITING INDUSTRY SECURITY CLEARANCES.

SECURITY INFORMATION:

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations with General Scientific Manufacturing Inc. (GSMI) of Panama City, FL, to utilize the A/M32K-10 Munitions Trailer, which is currently being designed, tested and manufactured via contract N68335-07-C-0403 by GSMI, to design, test, and manufacture the A/M32U-21 Maintenance Trailer (U-21).  

The U-21 shall utilize the same frame, suspension and running gear as the A/M32K-10 Munitions Trailer but with a different bed configuration and payload.  The U-21s payload shall consist of two generators, air compressor, storage cabinets, fuel tank, fuel cans, fire extinguishers, a cover and support structure.

NAWCAD intends to procure two (2) U-21 pilot production units and forty (40) U-21 production units via a firm fixed price contract.  The effort will also include a complete level III drawing package, a full Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package to include Maintenance Planning, Provisioning, and Technical Manuals to meet the U-21s configuration.   

As GSMI designed the A/M32K-10 and owns the 3-D model and stress model of the trailer, the Government does not posses sufficient data for an adequate evaluation of the A/M32K-10 payload in order to make the modifications necessary to meet the U-21 requirements.  Accordingly, it is the Governments intention to solicit and conduct negotiations to fulfill this requirement, on a sole source basis with GSMI, under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The Smithsonian Institution's (SI) National Zoological Park (NZP) is renewing its Seal and Sea Lion facilities and site.&nbsp; The existing Seal and Sea Lion exhibit was designed in 1977 as an anchor exhibit for the zoo's Beaver Valley.&nbsp; The 2787 square meter (30,000 sf) facility was built in 1978, and includes individual exhibit pools for seals and sea lions, separate holding pools for both species, and a large structure housing the life-support systems, maintenance, storage, and support operations.&nbsp; Age and technology advances have left the Seal and Sea Lion Life-Support Systems and the associated facilities in need of major revitalization so that current USDA and AZA standards for the care of marine mammals may be met.&nbsp; In addition, the pathway through the valley and exhibit area is steep and has numerous cross-slopes, making it difficult for people with disabilities and families with strollers to traverse.&nbsp; The underwater viewing area is also inaccessible to visitors with disabilities. This renewal project makes improvements and modifications to bring the facility into compliance with CFR Title 9 volume 1 - Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals.&nbsp; Furthermore, universal accessibility is achieved in all public areas of the site.</p>
<p>Work under this project includes: tree protection, protection of adjacent live-animal exhibits, an addition to and modification of the existing life support system building, new life support equipment, replacement of two exhibit pools, four holding pools, construction of a new amphitheater and under water viewing area, site retaining walls, accessible pathways, upgrade of utilities in Beaver Valley, a small food service cafe, faux rockwork, visitor and animal barrier systems, landscaping and other work as described in the construction documents.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution is interested in selecting the most qualified companies for this project. The information you provide in the attached Qualification Statement ("Statement") will be the basis for the evaluation of your Company. The prequalification of contractors is a highly competitive process.&nbsp; Only those entities that provide superior experience performance and capabilites can attain "most qualified" and become pre-qualified.</p>

The others being: one US Direct Hire (USDH) Office Director; one USDH Deputy Director; one US Personal Services Contractor (PSC) Quality Assurance and Maternal and Child Health Advisor, one Foreign Service Limited (FSL) Systems Strengthening Advisor (anticipated), one Third Country National PSC Malaria Advisor, one FSN Malaria Project Management Specialist; one FSN Family Planning Project Management Specialist; one FSN Financial Analyst and one FSN Administrative Assistant.  

The FPA will provide managerial oversight and technical advice to support the implementation of OHPs FP/RH program through a combination of bilateral agreements and buy-ins to USAID/Global Health Bureau cooperating agreements.   These activities range from supply driven activities such as training in the provision of FP/RH methods, and working with the host country to improve contraceptive security, to demand creation activities such as social marketing and behavior change communication intended to increase utilization of modern contraceptive methods, to policy and advocacy activities aimed at repositioning family planning and reproductive health in the Tanzanian national agenda. A new activity in Community Based Distribution is also anticipated.

S/he will also work closely with other USAID activities, which deal with maternal and child health, malaria, water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS (including policy, prevention, treatment, and care and support activities), systems strengthening, education and natural resources.  Because of the integrated nature of the program and the importance of HIV/AIDS within reproductive health, the Senior Family Planning Advisor shall ensure synergy and complementarity between family planning and all other USAID activities in Tanzania.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br />Project Description<br />This project is located at the Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, Colorado. It includes design of a new Class A facility to house a single federal agency national office.</p>
<p>The project involves construction of approximately 25,000 square feet of interior and exterior space for a future federal agency tenant. This design phase will consist of planning, preliminary design, and construction document completion. Consideration may be given to future Contract Administration services depending on funding, quality of design, and design services.</p>
<p>Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of Authority Cited: A federal agency has located within Region 8 and its operations are of a classified nature. There is a restriction on who has a "need to know" and limiting the access to facilities associated with those operations. The National Security issues are such that all personnel involved with the design and construction of this facility must hold an active SECRET Personal security clearance. The future Contractor and all subcontractors having access to the project drawings and specifications must also hold active facility clearances at the same level. Any significant breach of security or disruption of operations in the GSA Denver Federal Center Service Center would compromise national security. GSA has constantly sought to minimize the number of people who have a need to know anything about the GSA Denver Federal Center Service Center and the facility, capabilities and functionality therein in an effort to minimize the possibility that information could be compromised.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be posted on or about May 25, 2009.&nbsp; Proposals to the solicitation will be due on or about June 22, 2009.</p>

<a href="mailto:kenneth.m.hood@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate intends to acquire on an other than full and open competition basis, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, a contract to will support the Intelligent Decision aiding for Aircraft Survivability (IDAS) 6.3 Army Technology Objective (ATO) Technology Demonstration program by modifying the existing AVR-2B Laser Detecting System (LDS).  This modification will add an elevation sensor channel, which along with the existing azimuth channel, will generate highly accurate angles of arrival information to threats that employ laser designators and laser range-finding.  The modified laser detecting system will support accurate cueing of the IDAS Visual Laser Countermeasure System to successfully defeat these laser-aided threats.  AATD anticipates award of Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with a twenty-seven (27) month period of performance to Goodrich Corporation, who is the only known source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  It was determined that no other source has the expertise, experience, and design data necessary to satisfy the Government's requirement.  Since the AVR-2A/B system already exists on the aircraft and the systems are backwards compatible, provisions already exist on the test aircraft for the upgraded system which includes; (1) sensor and signal comparator module locations on the aircraft, (2) existing cable assemblies to be used for the upgraded system, (3) existing interface provisions which will be required for testing.  This is significant because of the potential cost savings for the upgraded system due to existing provisions on the test aircraft.  Because the Army has limited rights to the AVR-2A/B system, providing adequate documentation to manufacture the existing system through another source is not possible and the cost to duplicate this capability would be cost prohibitive.  Also, the costs to integrate a new system would also be cost prohibitive due to the development, integration, and testing of the new system to have the required form, fit and function of the existing system. The costs that would be duplicated for another firm to acquire a similar capability would be substantial.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by this agency.   This acquisition will be conducted using Alpha Contracting techniques; therefore a formal solicitation for this program will not be issued.  Any questions in regard to this announcement must be submitted in writing no later than 23 June 2009, 2:00 pm EST to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: RDMR-AAC (K. Hood), 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis VA 23604-5577.

Information and specifications on the vessel <BR>configuration file format may be obtained from CARIS. <BR><BR>           (14) Equipment and Techniques Required for Measuring Fluid Mud or <BR>Fluff<BR>If Fluid mud or Fluff is encountered the prescribed manner for surveying <BR>said area is to be surveyed with an Echo Sounder capable of surveying in <BR>dual frequency mode. The frequencies should be 200 kilohertz, 8 degree <BR>beam width or less and 40 kilohertz, 20 degree beam width or less <BR>transducers. In the event the 40 kilohertz transducer will not penetrate the <BR>fluff or fluid mud, replace it with a 24 kilohertz transducer.  Verify the fluff <BR>or fluid mud with a lead line following the EM 1110-2-1003 manual, <BR>chapter 8-2 lead line or sounding disk measurement for lead line <BR>requirements and chapter 21-6 for Alternative depth measurement <BR>techniques in suspended sediments. In processing the data, the processor <BR>should rely on the analog Echo Sounder scroll if the digitized depth were <BR>to lock out or to flat line. The Sabine Pass Outer Bar Channel, Sabine <BR>Pass Sabine Bank Channel and the Matagorda ship Channel are channels <BR>know to have Fluid mud or Fluff and should be surveyed in the above said <BR>manner.<BR><BR>5.4.c) Topographic Surveys - This Appendix A supplements Block 6 of <BR>Standard Form 252, and sets forth the general requirements for the performance <BR>of various surveying and mapping services required under this <BR>Architect-Engineer indefinite delivery type contract.  The Architect-Engineer shall <BR>perform all or part of the following prescribed services as more specifically <BR>identified in subsequent task orders.  Specific procedural, technical, and quality <BR>control requirements to be performed under this contract and subsequent task <BR>orders are also included in the paragraphs below as well as in Sections E <BR>through H of the contract.<BR><BR>(1) Boundary and Cadastral Surveys - These services will be conducted <BR>for the purpose of locating, relocating and/or marking Government <BR>boundaries, and preparing or filing/recording certified drawings, <BR>computations, deeds and related descriptive data in accordance with <BR>local, state and federal requirements, regulations and laws.<BR><BR>(2)  Topographic Mapping and Engineering Construction Surveys - <BR>These services include field acquisition and office data reduction of <BR>detailed topographic and planimetric feature data for use in: engineering <BR>site planning; cost estimating; design; construction layout and alignment of <BR>roads, channels, buildings and other structures; master planning; and <BR>recording as-built conditions.  Field data acquisition includes both <BR>conventional and electronic methods, such as, electronic total station, <BR>global positioning system (GPS), etc.<BR><BR>(3) Geodetic Control Surveys - These services include horizontal and <BR>vertical control surveys for the precise location of primary reference points <BR>from which engineering, design and construction control may be <BR>extended.  Precise surveys include third order or higher horizontal and <BR>vertical control, geodetic astronomy, gravity surveys, magnetic surveys <BR>and structural deformation surveys and studies.  These services shall <BR>include using conventional, electronic, conventional, GPS and other <BR>traditional precise survey methods.<BR><BR>(4) Photogrametric Mapping -Occasionally the AE will be required to perform <BR>small, short suspense aerial surveys in combination with photogrametric mapping tasks. <BR>These tasks usually require the use of airplanes to photograph the sites, with digital <BR>orthophotos and contour maps being the final work product. Specific instructions will be <BR>contained in Statements of Work for task orders, which will require photogrametric <BR>mapping.<BR><BR>5.4.d) Vessel Tracking and Reporting -These services include the requirement <BR>of the Galveston District and their clients to track and report location of dredges <BR>and survey vessels.  The Vessel Tracking system must offer the ability to track <BR>and query our survey launches and dredges in real time and in replay using a <BR>target tracking service. The system must also present the ability to generate log <BR>files of the positions for any target that was tracked and recorded.  The <BR>architecture of the tracking portion of the system will be comprised of a target <BR>service and a target source.  The target source can best be described as a <BR>software driver that can interpret an external positioning source into a common <BR>format that the target service can be supported. The Vessel Tracking system <BR>must unitize Galveston District's existing operational system PORTIS.  The <BR>Vessel Tracking system must support two types of sources:<BR><BR>*	DBL Database Locator or Target Data Positioning<BR>*	LTD Link Track Driver or Position Interface Solution<BR><BR>Target Data Positioning consists of defining a custom SQL statement to read <BR>from a source that has already been stored to a database.  Target data <BR>positioning component is required to a system to be stored and managed in the <BR>Galveston District's database environment.  The AE will implement the interface <BR>to a database, construct the correct SQL statements to obtain the information <BR>from the database, and maintain the database. The position interface will be <BR>designed to read directly from the existing Galveston District's server, so that <BR>they will be managed from within our operational system PORTIS. Training the <BR>Galveston's technicians in the use the position interface system will be an <BR>additional requirement. <BR><BR>6.

<p>"The HF SunAir system requires an impedance matching device (antenna coupler) that tunes the existing RF amplifier to 1,000 watts. Without this coupler the amplifier would have significant reflected power which decreases the total amount of RF being transmitted. The RF amplifier has an option already installed to use couplers, however, the connection has a 25 pin connector that sends/receives voltage levels that are unique to both the RF amplifier and the coupler. A mix and match of two different manufacturers is not possible."</p>

<DESC>The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS), Tucson, AZ intends to negotiate sole source with Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, 100 Indigo Creek Dr., Rochester, NY  14626 for the purchase of enGen recapper (one each) stock # 952136-EG.  This equipment purchase is a logical follow on purchase to augment an existing system.  The module must be compatible with the existing enGen Laboratory Automation System which was previously purchased from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and is currently maintained by same under a service contract.Ortho Clinical Diagnostics is the only known source for a compatible module.  Additionally, post warranty maintenance for this item can be added to the existing service contract with Ortho Clinical Diagnostics in lieu of establishing a separate maintenance contract with a different vendor.  This potentially saves money by eliminating duplicate efforts and also potential conflicts between two different vendors providing maintenance to separate portions of the same automated system.  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received prior to close of business (4:30PM local time) on May 18, 2009 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Patricia Wright, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-7217, Fax 301-827-7151, Email patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses to provide services for the project titled: Drug Product Content Risk Management and Surveillance (DCRMS) The NAICS Code is 511140.  Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents capacity and capability to provide the required services. 
The FDA needs drug data content management support because it has neither the expertise nor the skills to maintain content at the optimal accuracy, comprehensiveness, and timeliness to support its needs. 
The FDA currently does not have access to thousands of unlisted products on the market, so it cannot confront establishments regarding the drugs they do not list.  Thousands of commercial [drug content] manager clients and customers, including government drug programs, have access to significantly more complete drug product content.  However, FDAs current drug registration and listing system, DRLS, is incomplete and inaccurate.  

The FDA will soon replace the Drug Registration and Listing System (DRLS), which requires establishments to submit paper forms 2656 and 2657 to register and list (R&L).  A system that will allow establishments to R&L directly by electronic transaction is our goal.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires establishments to register and list their drugs (21 CFR 207).  The Drug Registration and Listing System (DRLS) serves as the repository of registered drug establishments and their listed drug products.  21 CFR 207 instructs industry to use Forms 2656 and 2657 to register and list, and considers unlisted drugs to be misbranded.  Non-compliant firms may be subject to criminal or regulatory action.  

Years of industry non-compliance have taken their toll.  The Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found numerous discrepancies in DRLS content as compared to that of a private industry drug product database.  Over 36% of DRLS drug product listings were no longer on the market.  Many drug products on the market were not listed in DRLS.  OIG concluded that FDA should routinely compare their drug product list with a commercial database to identify drugs that have not been listed and drugs which have been taken off the market.  Today, leadership among this group of private drug product databases boasts quality [accuracy and completeness] at the six sigma level1. These are industrys best practices group.

Establishments must register under the new electronic system and relist all of their drug products. But as the IG suggested, FDA neither has the expertise or the staff to manage accurate drug product content.  We seek to contract this and other services to a firm that maintains its own up to date list of accurate and complete drug products to insure FDA knows which drug products on the market have not been listed, and to provide its expertise, experience and professional resources to provide quality control for drug product content, labeling review, and other services to monitor compliance with FDA requirements.  

Drug Registration and Listing (DRLS) provides the following or is critical for a number of FDA and other Government Programs:

&#61607;	locations for foreign & domestic establishments and ingredient information on all drugs 
&#61607;	information for initial establishment inspections (Sec 704)
&#61607;	products affiliated with sites used in Risk Models guiding selection of GMP and ADE inspections
&#61607;	information on drug products identical, related, or similar to DESI and NDA/ANDA drugs
&#61607;	information that may be useful in identifying counterfeit, stolen, or diverted drugs.
&#61607;	a searchable data base to accomplish establishment and drug research.
&#61607;	a means by which to code unlisted drug products identified through external sources     	
&#61607;	Imports  In daily use at the Port Authority, officials use the DRLS database Import Query portal to determine if the foreign-made product is listed and has a [legitimate] NDC number (21 CFR 207.40 (b).  Includes finished dose products, APIs, investigational drugs, homeopathics, OTCs, and veterinarian products.
&#61607;	Centers for Medicaid/Medicare Services (CMS)  These government drug programs refer to DRLS and are the most adversely affected by inaccurate content on an almost daily basis and through the expertise/consultation of DRLS data base management services as an advisory, acquire information essential to enforcing their drug reimbursement policies.  
&#61607;	The Office of Compliance and other FDA activities depend on the DRLS database for high profile programs that depend on data base extractions and reports are the Risk Management Survey Samples, DQRS, ADE inspections, and the Unapproved Universe Problem Solving Working Group.
&#61607;	DEA  Refers to the DRLS as an adjunct to other policy guidance to determine which drugs are controlled substances and how they are classified (schedule assignment).
Note: With no professional oversight for label review at DRLS, we rely on the manufacturers determination regarding controlled substances designation.
&#61607;	NIH  Utilizes DRLS for research purpose.  They have recently requested additional information on all drug history including OTCs and homeopathic
&#61607;	VA and DoD Tricare Drug Programs  Recent focus on unapproved drugs has resulted in interest from other government agencies with formulary programs that will refer to the DRLS in the future to assist in determining candidate drug products that qualify for formulary inclusion.
&#61607;	Commercial drug database vendors frequently update their own databases by down-loading FDA approved drugs from the NDC Directory. 
&#61607;	Standard-Making Organizations  National Provider Organizations (NPOs) such as NCPDP download from the NDC Directory to gather data to support national standard initiatives (HIPAA, Drug Protocols for Reimbursement).
&#61607;	Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, Distributors (Wholesalers, etc), pharmacies and pharmacy chains download NDC Directory data for various purposes to verify drug listing info and to gain advantage in the marketplace.
&#61607;	Import Agents and Mediators  access DRLS data base to verify drug listing data

The primary objectives to be accomplished under this contract include:

To provide the support necessary to maintain a high degree of accuracy and completeness of drug products entered and listed in DRLS and eLIST.  With this focus, the FDA will make strides toward establishing itself along with private drug product databases, as an accurate and comprehensive source for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs on the US market.  Also, FDA will have at its disposal a consistent source of expertise and skills to identify and manage not only listed drug products, but have substantial information on all drug products on the US market.
Responses to this notice shall be limited to 15 pages, and must include:
1.	Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is soliciting information about potential sources for the fabrication ofinfrared sensor chip assemblies and cryogenic signal processing electronics to meet therequirements of the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is a jointly funded anddeveloped mission by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) and is a space-based, mediumaperture, wide field, optical telescope with near-infrared (NIR) imaging andspectroscopic instrumentation.	JDEM will survey the sky to accurately measure themagnitude and redshift of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), spectroscopicredshifts of a large sample of galaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) studies,and accurate shape parameters and photometric redshift measurements of a large sample ofgalaxies for Weak Lensing (WL) studies.  The Telescope Assembly portion of theobservatory is expected to be a Three Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) with 2 tertiary mirrorsthat will provide the optical train to the Government developed JDEM instrument (2 focalplanes and a fine guidance sensor).  The JDEM telescope is expected to have a primarymirror size of ~1.5 meters in diameter and operate at a temperature up to 293 Kelvin. The JDEM observatory is expected to be launched aboard a NASA provided EELV in late 2015to an orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange point (L2) and be operated for a minimumof 5 years.  NASA contemplates building an Engineering Development Unit (EDU) focal plane and needs aset of Sensor Chip Assemblies (SCA) to populate it as well as a set of cryogenic readoutelectronics for control and data handling.  The objectives of the EDU focal plane are toassess our ability to assemble and align multiple, close-packed SCAs into a mosaicarray, remove and replace SCAs without disturbing neighboring SCAs, assess performanceof the SCAs over the operating temperature range, and assess the ability of the EDU towithstand the dynamic launch environment. NASA seeks a complement of SCAs in accordancewith our preliminary specification.  The specification requirements were developed aspart of our assessment of scientific and mission requirements for JDEM.

<DESC>PURPOSE:

This is a sources sought notice to support NISTs market research efforts to identify qualified potential sources for an acquisition that NIST intends to solicit in Summer 2009 and award in Fall 2009.  This is not a solicitation, and proposals are not being requested at this time. 

BACKGROUND:

As a part of the NIST Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) implementation plan, NIST seeks to automate assessment and implementation of Technical Family security controls as documented in Special Publication 800-53 Revision 2.  To this end, NIST intends to use a portion of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 funds to accelerate the development of security automation specifications, evolve existing Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) specifications, develop and evolve validation programs, and develop quality-assured reference data.

So that NIST can ensure an appropriate acquisition strategy is employed for the forthcoming Security Automation Support Services acquisition, NIST seeks to identify sources that have current capability and experience to perform contract work for NIST in the following SCAP and security automation areas:

1. Evolution of the SCAP protocol and specifications thereof;

2. Feasibility studies, development, documenting, prototyping, and road-mapping of SCAP expansions (e.g., remediation capability) and analog protocols (e.g., Network Event Content Automation Protocol);

3. Implementation and maintenance support for the Security Automation Content Validation Program;

4. Maintenance support for the SCAP Product Validation Program;

5. Pilot, beta, and production support for SCAP and security automation use-cases;

6. Content development, modification, and testing;

7. Infrastructure and reference implementation development in JAVA, C++, and C programming languages; and

8. Data trust models and data provenance solutions.


TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE:

Sources that have current capabilities and experience in the areas specified above are asked to respond to this notice and provide the following in their response:

The Ocean Color Radiometry, Sea Surface Temperature, Ocean Surface Vector Winds and Synthetic Aperture Radar product suites will be among the primary focal areas in the next three years. <br />Program Development, Coordination, and Outreach tasks will involve: developing new capabilities and user bases within NOAA (especially in support of the NOAA IOOS Program Office), outreach to academic, professional and educational groups, and program development and presentation skills. Project management and coordination will required only at a modest level and will required to coordinate the various aspects of the task, assure adherence to delivery schedules, and to maintain reporting standards and timeliness. At this time it is anticipated that technical project oversight should be minimal. <br />Non-Scientific Program Support will consist of supporting CoastWatch/OceanWatch and SOCD and its three branches (Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry, Ocean Sensors Branch, and the Marine Ecosystems and Climate Branch), supporting property oversight, travel management, meeting coordination, internal and external correspondences, weekly reporting and response to actions. <br />It is expected that systems used by NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch will evolve extensively over the next several years. The skills mix of the contract staff should be flexible to respond to these changing demands. Additional contract staff might be required to meet unanticipated requirements of the government.<br />NOAA is anticipating a base one year requirement with four (4) option years for these services. Attached is the statement of work for the Satellite Oceanography and Climatology Division (SOCD). Contractors are to provide capability statements for the following projected labor categories: a Project Coordinator/Project Manager (400 hours); Senior Systems Analyst/Senior Programmers (10416 hours); and an Administrative Assistant (2080 hours).</p>

NSPD 51 requires all agencies to ensure that they can comply with seven criteria in executing their COOP, thereby mitigating the risk that COOP goals will not be met.  One of the primary factors in any Continuity plan and a key element in the NSPD 51 mandate is that each agency should ensure that it has identified, trained, and prepared its emergency relocation personnel to relocate to an alternate operating site and continue to execute its primary mission essential function.  In addition, the Federal Continuity Directive 1 guidance requires agencies to conduct training/testing/exercises annually to ensure its disaster readiness and to improve through after action reporting.

<p>&nbsp;The labor categories that may be required under the Administrate and Support Services requirement include the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounting Clerk I <br />Performs very simple and routine accounting clerical operations, for example, recognizing and comparing easily identified numbers and codes on similar and repetitive accounting documents, verifying mathematical accuracy, and identifying discrepancies and bringing them to the supervisor's attention. Supervisor gives clear and detailed instructions for specific assignments. Employee refers to supervisor all matters not covered by instructions. Work is closely controlled and reviewed in detail for accuracy, adequacy, and adherence to instructions.</p>
<p><br />Accounting Clerk II <br />Performs one or more routine accounting clerical operations, such as: examining, verifying, and correcting accounting transactions to insure completeness and accuracy of data and proper identification of accounts, and checking that expenditures will not exceed obligations in specified accounts; totaling, balancing, and reconciling collection vouchers; posting data to transaction sheets where employee identifies proper accounts and items to be posted; and coding documentation accordance with a chart (listing) of accounts. Employee follows specific and detailed accounting procedures. Corrects errors or lists discrepancies for adjustment. Completed work is reviewed for accuracy and compliance with procedures.</p>
<p><br />Accounting Clerk III <br />Uses a knowledge of double entry bookkeeping in performing one or more of the following: Posts actions to journals, identifying subsidiary accounts affected and debit and credit entries to be made and assigning proper codes; reviews computer printouts against manually maintained journals, detecting and correcting erroneous postings, and preparing documents to adjust accounting classifications and other data; or reviews lists of transactions rejected by an automated system, determining reasons for rejections, and preparing necessary correcting material.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is expanding the radar capabilities at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). This involves the addition of a remote balloon launching facility at our North Slope of Alaska (NSA), Barrow, Research Site. This facility will enable radio sonde launches to take place on a regular schedule with little impact from severe local weather conditions that can at times cause launches to be canceled because operators are unable to reach the site.</p>
<p>Performing balloon launches on a regular schedule in arctic climates can become a difficult, time consuming, even dangerous occupation. At the NSA site, access roads can easily become closed by blizzard conditions and cold temperatures can compromise the integrity of a launch. In order to maintain a set launch schedule it may be necessary to keep personnel on-site well beyond their normal working hours. The desire to increase the number of daily BBSS operations can make this effort extremely expensive. The implementation of a remote balloon launching facility that can launch a considerable number of balloons on a regular schedule unattended will allow for long-range cost savings and a safer operating environment.</p>
<p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide a remote balloon launcher in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill and launch radiosonde balloons (up to 800 g in size) with attached radiosondes automatically<br />&bull; Capable of performing at least 24 consecutive launches without attendance, including balloon filling (helium) and ground check procedures associated with the Vaisala Digicora radiosonde system<br />&bull; Provides storage location for helium<br />&bull; Capable of operating in extreme weather conditions, including high winds, blizzard conditions, extreme cold (-40 C)<br />&bull; Heated shelter for preconditioning/preparing balloons at 1-2 wk intervals<br />&bull; Ability to control and monitor launch schedule remotely<br />&bull; Capable of arbitrary, changeable launch schedule<br />&bull; Has a NIST traceable surface weather station for ground comparison</p>
<p>Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Orlando, FL, is seeking information regarding possible image generation solutions for the CFFT systems and potential sources that currently possess the capabilities to provide these image generation solutions.<BR><BR>PURPOSE:<BR>The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) program is conducting an analysis of image generators to determine if we should 1) continue delivering CFFT systems with the current image generators, 2) if we should integrate a new image generator into the CFFT systems that have not been delivered, or 3) if we should purchase new image generators for all CFFT systems.  The analysis will focus on 1) the capabilities of the image generator today, 2) what functionality would need to be developed to meet the program requirements, and 3) cost.  The result of the analysis will be a decision on which approach to take with the CFFT image generators and which products would best meet the requirements of the CFFT program.  If it is decided to integrate new image generators into the CFFT systems, the integration would start in October/November 2009.<BR><BR>The total number of CFFT systems to be delivered is approximately 405.  Of the 405 total systems, approximately 155 systems have been delivered to date.  These systems are delivered in 1-to-4, 1-to-12, and 1-to-30 (instructor-to-student) configurations.  The 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations require 3 image generators.  The 1-to-30 configurations require 4 image generators.  There will be a total of 33 1-to-30 configurations delivered.  The remaining systems will be 1-to-4 and 1-to-12.<BR><BR>For the 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations, an image generator is required for the enhanced student station which provides Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) views; a second image generator for the Stealth system at the Instructor Operators Station; and the third image generator for the rendered real-world scene projected on a classroom screen.  The 1-to-30 configuration has an additional image generator for additional field-of-view on the classroom screen to accommodate the larger student number.<BR><BR>The key parameters that will determine the approach the program takes are the following:<BR>"	Low cost visual system<BR>"	Reduce Life Cycle cost<BR>"	Leverage SE CORE database generation and models<BR>"	Compliance to the JFPL Standards<BR>"	Integration schedule compliance<BR>  <BR>INFORMATION SOUGHT:<BR><BR>Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following:<BR><BR>a.	Completed Vendor IG Response Table. (Attachment A below)<BR>b.	A statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015.<BR>c.

Any additional information will be discarded without review.   The information provided needs to define the current functionality/capabilities of the product that you would recommend to this program.  At this time no cost information is being requested.  A point of contact for the CFFT team can speak to concerning your product and costing of the product is requested.<BR> <BR>It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document no later than 3:30PM EST via email to adam.baldwin@us.army.mil on or before May 29, 2009.  <BR><BR>This Request for Information is being posted on both the PEO STRI Business Opportunities Portal (STRI BOP) and to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  If responses are received from STOC II contractors only, the Government reserves the right to follow STOC II Request For Proposal procedures as outlined in the STOC II User Guide if and when the RFP becomes necessary.<BR><BR>STOC II PARTICIPANTS ONLY: All STOC II Lot I and II contractors who are interested in receiving an RFP must provide the information requested above by the due date stated above.  For those STOC II contractors failing to respond by the closing date above, the Government reserve the right to eliminate those contractors from further consideration for potential award.

<a href="mailto:elaine.m.scarnici@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The US Army Natick RDECOM Contracting Center, Soldier Support Branch is seeking technical information for (a) new relocateable tension fabric structures (SHELTERS), and (b) replacement and repair parts for, and compatible with, the Armys existing inventory of Clamshells SHELTERS already in, or due to return to, War Reserve, to allow those SHELTERS to be refurbished at the conclusion of any deployment.  The new SHELTERS that are required include the following at a minimum:  (i) The Large Area Maintenance Shelter, Aviation Maintenance Type (LAMS-AM); the approximate exterior dimensions are 75 feet wide, 191 feet long, 31 feet high at the peak and 14 feet high at the eave.  It shall have 2 single personnel doors, 2 operational end doors with electric winches included, 2 ventilation fans, 8 gravity vents, a high wind kit, a 120/208V 60Hz 3Ph electrical system with a 150A load center, ten 400W overhead lights and ten 120V 20A duplex receptacles.  This shelter shall be packable in two 20 steel ISO shipping containers, and shall withstand steady 90 mph winds with the high wind kit installed. (ii) The Large Area Maintenance Shelter, Vehicle Maintenance Type (LAMS-VM); the approximate exterior dimensions are 75 feet wide, 128 feet long, 31 feet high at the peak and 14 feet high at the eave.  It shall have 2 single personnel doors, 2 manually operated steel 12 x 12 vehicle roll-up doors, 2 operational end doors with electric winches included, 2 ventilations fans, 6 gravity vents, a high wind kit, a 120/208V 60Hz 3Ph electrical system with a 150A load center, eight 400W overhead lights and eight 120V 20A duplex receptacles.  This shelter shall be packable in one 20 steel ISO shipping container, and shall withstand steady 90 mph winds with the high wind kit installed.  (iii) The Large Area Maintenance Shelter, Storage Type (LAMS-S); the approximate exterior dimensions are 49 feet wide, 63 feet long, 24 feet high at the peak, and 14 feet high at the eave.  It shall have 2 single personnel doors and 2 manually operated steel 12 x 12 (upgrade-able to 14 x 14 vehicle roll-up doors.   In addition, Offerors are requested to offer other SHELTERS of various sizes made with the same structural frame components and fabric panels and the same optional features as the LAMS-AM, LAMS-VM and LAMS-S (collectively, the LAMS) so they can be interchanged with the structural frame components of the LAMS. The SHELTERS shall be portable, temporary facilities of modular construction to support forward operational areas without fixed facilities as staging bases, logistics warehousing areas, and as maintenance facilities for Army rotary-wing, fixed wing aircraft, or ground combat or other vehicles.  A shelter that is capable of expedient erection/strike in intense sun, blowing sand and high wind is essential.  This requirement necessitates installation of the majority of the major components at a low level to ensure safety in high wind conditions and timeliness.  Expedience is necessary because the shelters are intended to be highly mobile and redeployed.  To expedite the installation process, the arches must be designed so that roof purlins can be attached to groups of up to 6 arches at one time, after the arches have been assembled, attached to both base plates, and manually propped using the props in the installation tool kit so that the peak of the arch is no more than 14 off the ground.  Each end of each purlin must be connected to one of the 6 arches while in this propped position.  The design must permit the arches to then be winched into the vertical position in a single winching action without the use of a forklift or other material handling equipment.  There shall be no additional roof purlins required between these arches, and the roof purlins connecting these 6 arches shall require no further adjustment or connection either during or after the winching action that raises the arches to the vertical position.  Each basic SHELTER includes the following components:  structural frame members; exterior weather barrier made from PVC fabric; personnel doors and an anchoring system for anchoring the SHELTER to a concrete surface using Hilti-style anchors.   Options that should be available with each SHELTER include an erection/installation kit including all tools, items and hardware necessary to erect, strike, and maintain the SHELTER; a field useable fabric repair kit; in addition to, or instead of, the anchoring system for anchoring the SHELTER to a concrete surface, an anchoring kit/system for an earth or asphalt surface using duckbill style anchors; high wind kit for additional anchoring against high winds; electrical system including main power panel with main breaker and sub-circuit GFCI breakers, junction boxes, general illumination lighting, duplex receptacles, switches, wiring, and other items necessary to supply electrical power and lighting within the SHELTER; ventilation fans; gravity vents for natural ventilation; manually operated steel vehicle roll-up doors; electrically operated Clamshell end doors for aircraft or large equipment use (unless SHELTER has only flat ends) and operators manual.   North American Industry Classification System code is 332311.   At this time, RDECOM is seeking sources, technical and product information for a Large Area Maintenance Shelter LAMS that meets the Armys requirements.  This market survey is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government.  Responses may be sent via email to Steven.Nye@us.army.mil or by regular mail to US Army RDECOM, STEFD (ATTN:  Steven Nye), Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760, Telephone (508) 233-5608, Fax (508) 233-4190  Responses are due by 8 June 2009.

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Clear and Smoked Wall Hanging Files to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-09-05-08-01
<RESPDATE>052209
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Clear and Smoked Wall Hanging Files by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1808 File, Wall Hanging, Clear - 3PK Wall Pockets, Crystal Polystyrene, 13-1/4w x 4 d x 14-7/8 h</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1809 File, Wall Hanging, Smoke - 3PK Wall Pockets, Crystal Polystyrene, 13-1/4w x 4 d x 14-7/8 h</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1810 File, Wall Hanging, Clear - Single Wall Pocket, Crystal Polystyrene, 13-1/4w x 4 d x 14-7/8 h</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1811 File, Wall Hanging, Smoke - Single Wall Pocket, Crystal Polystyrene, 13-1/4w x 4 d x 14-7/8 h</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/Federal Supply Service Office Support Center - Paper Products, New York NY. <br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Clear and Smoked Wall Hanging Files to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1808 SPR 60001, RUB 47014, UNV 53682, RUB 51514</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1809 RUB 47081, RUB 47086, SPR 60000, SPR 60002, DEF 73602-RT, <br />RUB 12803, RUB 47021, RUB 51521, UNV 53683</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1810 SPR 60004, RUB 48714, DEF 73201, DEF 63101, DEF 63201</p>
<p>7520-00-NIB-1811 SPR 60005, SPR 60003, RUB 48721, RUB 48706, DEF 63102, <br />DEF 73202, DEF 63202</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Clear and Smoked Wall Hanging Files to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 22, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Negotiate a Sole Source Contract With Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
<SOLNBR>AB133F-09-RP-0103
<RESPDATE>062309
<CONTACT>Crystina R Elkins, Phone (206) 526-6036, Email crystina.r.elkins@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) for a comprehensive study of North Pacific right whales. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Marine Mammal Laboratory has a requirement for a comprehensive study of North Pacific right whales as follows: Right whales (Eubalaena japonica) in the eastern North Pacific rank as the world&rsquo;s smallest and most critically endangered whale population. Following intensive historical whaling and large illegal catches by the USSR in the 1960's, it is likely that eastern North Pacific right whales now number in the tens of animals, and their conservation is a high priority for NMFS. Research to assess abundance, trend, vital rates and feeding ecology is urgently needed, since very little is known about this population. In 2004, tracking of a satellite-tagged right whale together with acoustic detections led to the discovery of a concentration of an estimated 23 right whales, the largest such aggregation observed since the Soviet catches of the 1960's. Work by AFSC and others has focused on attempting to gather basic data on right whales, using a combination of photo-identification and genetic sampling methods. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will perform basic oceanographic sampling for habitat characterization focusing on the foraging ecology study of right whales utilizing the Realtime Acoustic Tracking System (RATS), the custom-designed acoustic tag and accompanying integrative protocols have been developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. There is presently no other way to collect accurate positions of the tagged whale and transmit those positions in real time (other than the RATS system), which facilitates environmental sampling very close to the tagged whale, and proximate acoustic observations to allow recording of both the tagged whale's vocalizations as well as nearby whales. This system has been used with great success in very similar studies of North Atlantic right whales, which are regarded as a direct proxy for right whales in the North Pacific. As a result, WHOI alone possesses the equipment, the approach and the taxon-specific experience to successfully conduct the study NMML/AFSC proposed. The only other method available in marine mammal science to estimate movement data while simultaneously collecting acoustic data is a digital acoustic recording tag with integrated accelerometers. For the NP Right Whale study, this type of tag will not allow us to achieve our objectives because (1) it cannot transmit whale positions in real time, therefore it is impossible to track the whale close enough to do the required environmental sampling that will allow us to determine what the whale is feeding on and how its dive behavior is influenced by oceanographic conditions, and (2) on-animal acoustic recordings are adversely affected by flow noise such that recordings can only be made of the tagged whale and whales that are within a few hundred meters of the tagged whales. One of the hypotheses that we want to test is that the whales communicate over several kilometers to advertise food resources, therefore the acoustic recording system must be able to record animal vocalizations from several kilometers away. Digital recording tags cannot do this, whereas the RATS was designed specifically to do this. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately July 1, 2009 and includes two (2) option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5M. This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government&rsquo;s belief that only Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)can provide these services. However, other potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services may submit such data which demonstrates the technical requirements stated above in duplicate no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. This data must include sufficient information to allow NOAA to evaluate the proposal relative to the technical requirements stated above. Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. No cost or pricing data is required. Responses shall be faxed to Crystina Elkins at (206)526-6036 or provided by e-mail to Crystina.R.Elkins@noaa.gov. THIS NOT A SOLICITATION. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered in CCR please access the following web site:http//www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dunn &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>This notice of intent to issue a sole source purchase order to Com Tek is for a follow-on procurement of 21 Drawbase licenses and annual support and maintenance for the Defense Health Services Systems (DHSS).Annual support and maintenance will be provided on a 12-month basis with four (4) 12-month option periods to renew, and options for additional quantities for new licenses, license upgrades and training. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1(2)(ii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Com Tek (doing business as Drawbase Software Incorporated) is the sole manufacturer of the proprietary Drawbase software.Drawbase software is currently integrated into DHSSs Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) system to provide users at over 200 DoD locations with robust capability related to computer aided design (CAD) drawings (electronic facility plans/blueprints).  Each room in the DMLSS Room Inventory database is directly linked to the corresponding room in the electronic CAD drawing, allowing users to perform graphical queries in which the drawings are automatically color-coded in accordance with the query results.  The electronic drawings are also used to perform mission critical functions such as documenting emergency exit routes, developing projects plans, managing moves, and planning disaster response.<BR><BR>To ensure compliance with DoD software rules that prohibit outdated versions of commercial software from running on government computers/networks, DHSS must periodically upgrade existing Drawbase software licenses.  Furthermore, as other variables inside the DMLSS system change (software, hardware, network configuration, DoD information assurance rules, etc.) the custom software code that makes up the interface between DMLSS and Drawbase must also be fixed or enhanced.  As a result, an ongoing commitment to licenses upgrades, telephone help desk support, technical development/consulting support, and training is required to ensure the best possible product is available to the end users.  Com Tek (doing business as Drawbase Software Incorporated) is the manufacturer of the proprietary Drawbase software.  Drawbase does not have any authorized resellers.

<a href="mailto:mary.connors@va.gov">Contracting Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source contract to Avery Biomedical Devices, Inc. for a Mark IV Transmitter (Breathing Pacemaker).  A fixed price contract was awarded.  It is the Governments belief that only Avery Biomedical Devices, Inc. possessed the required FDA approved device to successfully meet the VAs requirement.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALCONTRACT VA241-P-1200MARK IV TRANSMITTERSOLE SOURCE AWARDJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-21. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.VA Boston Healthcare SystemSurgical Service & Spinal Cord Injury Service West Roxbury, MA2.	 Nature and/or description of the action being approved. Sole Source award of a firm fixed priced contract to Avery Biomedical Devices, Inc. for an Avery Biomedical Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker 3.	 Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).Cost: $64,842.00Avery Biomedical Devices produces a breathing pacemaker which is a phrenic nerve stimulator. It consists of surgically implanted electrodes and receivers and an external transmitter, which sends radio signals to the implants via flexible antennas that are worn over the receivers. It provides a higher quality of life for patients with quadriplegia requiring mechanical ventilation.4.   Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-2, 41 USC 253 (c) (2), unusual & compelling urgency.FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source*5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.Breathing pacemakers have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 1986 and have been in use by some patients for over thirty years. Avery Biomedical Devices Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker is the only breathing pacemaker with FDA premarket approval for use in persons who require chronic ventilatory support.  The transmitter generates a series of impulses which are sent by the antenna through the skin as a radio wave. The receiver converts the radio waves to an electrical impulse which travels down the electrode to the phrenic nerve. The nerve then sends these impulses to the diaphragm causing it to contract, and draw air in. When the impulses stop, the diaphragm relaxes, and exhalation occurs. This series of impulses are repeated cyclically, resulting in a normal breathing pattern. Breathing pacemakers provide a more normal breath since it uses negative pressure to draw air into the lungs rather than forcing air in under positive pressure. This negative pressure ventilation allows for normal speech, and improved ease of eating and drinking. Mobility is also greatly improved.  The need for suctioning is reduced dramatically, so pacing patients are less prone to respiratory infections. The reduction of suctioning supplies, ventilator circuits, etc. result in a substantial cost savings as well.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be published. The only other like device does not have FDA approval  for spinal cord injury (SCI)  patients.7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The pricing offered is catalog list pricing offered to all purchasers of the Mark IV product.  8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.The intended use of the breathing pacemaker is for spinal cord injured patient care.  Due to varying conditions of spinal cord patients, a finite window of opportunity exists to insert the breathing pacemaker.  Urgent and compelling conditions exist (defined below) that require that the pacemaker be procured expeditiously. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, Statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.Breathing pacemakers require a functioning phrenic nerve and an intact diaphragm to work appropriately. Typical patients have:	High spinal cord (C1 - C3) or brainstem injuriesThere are two surgical approaches which can be used to implant a breathing pacemaker: The first technique involves placing the electrodes on the phrenic nerve in the chest.Refinements in this technique over the years have resulted in the need for only small incision made in between a pair of ribs on each side. Surgeons experienced with minimally invasive surgery have used thoracoscopic techniques and robotically-assisted techniques to make this approach even simpler. The second technique involves placing the electrodes in the neck. This technique has the advantage of avoiding a thoracotomy, but cannot be performed on all patients. For example, the anatomy of the neck is not sufficiently developed in the youngest patients to make this technique appropriate. Although some cases can be performed on an outpatient basis, the average hospital stay is 1-2 days. The decision as to which approach is appropriate for a given patient should be made by the surgeon performing the procedure.Breathing pacemakers require a functioning phrenic nerve and an intact diaphragm to work appropriately. Typical patients have:	High spinal cord (C1 - C3) or brainstem injuries	Congential or acquired central hypoventilation syndromes	Diaphragm paralysis of known or unknown etiologyFor patients with lower (C3-C4) injuries, there is a chance that the phrenic nerves may have been damaged at the time of the injury. These patients may require some additional preoperative consideration.Common screening procedures include:	phrenic nerve conduction studies,	diaphragm EMGs,	pulmonary function tests, and	polysomnography.10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  The Contracting Activity will continue to promote full and open competition, where possible.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to procure Safway scaffolding for the CEV Crew Moduleto be delivered to and installed at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico no later thanthe week of June 22, 2009.  Using Safway materials, construct scaffolding that provides 360X access to the crewmodule (CM) at two levels and splits in half to allow for easy removal of the CM from thescaffolding.  The CM is a cone shape with a rounded base and the point of the cone is cutoff.  The base of the CM is 16 feet in diameter at its widest point and the top is about8.5 feet in diameter at the level of the top platform (the Forward Bay).  The CM isresting on a fixture with casters (the CMTF) that holds the CM about three feet off thefloor at the CMs lowest point.  The CMTF is a 17 foot by 18 foot rectangular frame thatsupports the CM and is about 3 feet 8 inches.  The scaffolding should be on adjustablecasters to make it easy to roll away from the CM and make it easy to adjust the height ofthe platforms by a few inches in either direction. The scaffolding must be stand-alone;it may not rest on the CM or CMTF at any point.  o	Upper PlatformX	12 feet off the groundX	Must provide 360X access to the CMX	Roughly 5 foot wide platform completely encircling the Forward BayX	Must leave a gap of 6 inches or less between the edge of the platform and the CMForward Bay(This results in an outer diameter of about 20 feet and an inner diameter of about 10feet on the upper platform)o	Lower PlatformX	4 feet off the groundX	Must provide 360X access to the CMX	Four, 4ft by 7ft platforms spaced around the CMo	Wood may be used to get the work platforms close to the CMo	All the wood surfaces must be cut and placed to provide an even walking surfaceand avoid tripping hazards.o	StaircaseX	Only one staircase is required, however, it must be removable and must beattachable to both halves of the scaffolding.X	It must be a single-wide staircase; there may NOT be a turn in the stairs.*All dimensions are approximate.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quotation. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Trace Vapor Explosives Detector. All equipment must be new.  Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive and narcotic detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art ion mobility spectrometers and other technologies for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. 

NIST is currently developing standards for vapor detection and requires a state-of-the-art trace explosive vapor detector system.  NIST has a requirement to investigate the measurement capabilities of detectors for trace explosives.  
NIST has procured a variety of trace detection systems to help develop comprehensive standards.  As such, some models have already been purchased and tested.  Models already tested at NIST include a GE VaporTracer2, a Bahia21 MO-2M, a Smiths Sabre2000, and a GE MobileTrace.  Any other model detectors that meet all required specifications shall be considered for award.

For the purpose of this solicitation, explosive means any compound identified on the most recent edition of the Department of Treasury/Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearm (ATF)/Commerce and Explosives list available at www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-list.htm.


All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line item:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Trace Vapor Explosives Detector which shall meet or exceed the following required minimum specifications:

1. The system must be designed to detect trace levels of gas-phase explosives in ambient air samples.  

2. The system must be capable of providing quantitative information on the analytes; 

3. The system must be capable of fully functional control through MS Windows-based software, and display and record measurement data.  The need for MS Windows is based on the need to be compatible with the current operating system in use at NIST;

4. The system must be field deployable and handheld.  The system must be able to run off a battery and weigh less than 30 pounds;

5.  The system must run 30 minutes, at a minimum, off of a battery;

6. The detection limit for at least one explosive analyte must be 10 picograms or less.  Lower detection limit and the ability to detect multiple explosives are preferred;

7. Sampling and analysis time must be 20 seconds or less per sample.   

Line Item 0002: Installation: The Contractor shall provide installation for the system.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash. Installation shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

<SUBJECT>Caribbean Regional Interagency Presidents Emergency Program for HIV/AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Coordinator
<SOLNBR>538-09-001
<RESPDATE>060109
<CONTACT>Soraya A Morillo, Procurement Supervisor, Phone 809-731-7042, Fax 809-221-0023, Email smorillo@usaid.gov - Nancy L. Hoffman, Executive Officer, Phone 809-731-7034, Fax 809-221-0023, Email nhoffman@usaid.gov
<DESC>The incumbent is the primary point of contact with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator and is the coordinator of activities related to the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (the Emergency Plan/PEPFAR) in the Region. The PEPFAR Coordinator plays a critical role in the planning, implementation, and reporting of program performance of inter-agency programs. The role of the Coordinator is particularly critical given the institutional and geographic complexity of this Regional partnership Framework.

The U.S. Ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean heads the inter-agency, multi-country PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker under PEPFAR Guidance to all program plans and activities submitted to the US Global AIDS Coordinator for approval.  The coordinator must ensure that the Ambassador and DCM in Barbados are kept closely apprised of Regional Partnership Framework issues and developments, and that issues requiring their decision are brought to them in a timely manner.  

The Coordinator is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. The
Coordinator is, in general, not a technical director, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Country Operational Plan (COP) and other performance review information. When delegated this authority by the Ambassador, the Coordinator may represent PEPFAR with external partners including government, press, and others. Agency leads may also be expected to play a role in public diplomacy based on authority delegated by the Ambassador.

Embassy Bridgetown should establish a management interagency working group comprising agency leads (who may be heads of agencies or of technical offices depending on agency preference). The relationship between the management-working group, the Coordinator, and each  Ambassador/Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) will vary according to national and regional requirements. While there may be some exceptions based on the determination of the Ambassador, the norm is that the Coordinator will be accountable to ensure such a group is established, has an agenda, and is achieving objectives. The Chief of Mission of each participating country will receive technical support from the Coordinator, with the overall communication and reporting to OGAC being managed by the Coordinator through Embassy Bridgetown.

Leadership of Technical Working Groups (TWGs) will vary from, and should be rotated periodically, and be seen as an opportunity to promote Foreign Service National (FSN) leadership where appropriate. The management-working group may delegate coordination of TWGs, but in general, the TWGs should report directly to a management oversight group. While there may be some exceptions based on the determination of the Ambassador, the norm is that the Coordinator, in collaboration with Agency leads, will be accountable to ensure that these groups are established, have an agenda and are achieving objectives.

Agency leads should be copied on communications between the Coordinator and TWGs or staff as well as on substantive communications between the Coordinator and the core team lead in headquarters. This procedure is essential to retain trust and respect between agency leads and the Coordinator. In addition, it is critical that the Coordinator be copied on internal agency communication related to matters of PEPFAR program strategy, implementation, and management and staffing.

The Coordinator may represent the agencies at official meetings if so delegated by the DCM and Agencies. When a Coordinator meets with host country Government (host Government) counterparts, s/he should include agency leads or, if not possible, consult with agency leads.

The Coordinator is the lead for the COP, Semi-Annual Performance Review (SAPR), and the Annual Performance Review (APR) development process.

The Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that reports are submitted to Washington in time, for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work, and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) Contracting and Facilities Division (PGE) is seeking contractors to provide Nationwide Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Related Professional Services.

The Government intends to award nine (9) National Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quality (IDIQ) contracts pursuant to procedures established by the Brooks Act and FAR Subpart 36.6, with a base year and four 1-year options, for a total of five (5) years. Of the nine potential awards, four awards will be awarded to Unrestricted Businesses and five awards will be 100% Set-Aside for Small Businesses. Each contract, whether Unrestricted or Small Business ventures would require numerous specialty consultants and subcontractors. The contracts would be nationwide in geographic scope (i.e. all States and US Territories). The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards.

Market Analysis. A Sources Sought Notice (GS-00P-09-CY-0073) was published in FedBizOpps on February 4, 2009, inviting contractors to participate in a market analysis to determine the capability and availability of small business firms to provide nationwide BIM services for the Public Buildings Service. A total of 42 firms responded by the closing date of February 19, 2009.  As a result, it has been determined that this requirement can be partially set-aside for small businesses.

Background. In July 2003, the General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Office of the Chief Architect and Construction Programs (OCA-CP) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.

<p>FAR Clause # Title Date Change</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. In determining best value to the Government, a trade-off analysis of the relative benefits and/or risk to the Government in terms of the impact on contract performance will be performed, if necessary. In performing this best value trade-off analysis, as one factor is determined substantially equal among competing offers, the other factors grow more important in making the award selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability. In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed all specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. (see Proposal Submittal Requirements) If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal. The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before being considered further.</p>
<p>Best Value Evaluation Factors. Offers that are determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated in terms of past performance and price. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are moderately more important than price. Past Performance is moderately more important than price. The evaluation factors that will be used in evaluating and determining the offer which represents the best value to the Government are listed in order of importance as stated below:</p>
<p>1) Technical Capability: Evaluation of technical capability will include, but not be limited to, assessment of the bid sample provided by the offeror. Bid sample will be one full kit for each Exhibit A and Exhibit B (meaning two full kits will be delivered to NSWC).</p>
<p>2) Past Performance: Evaluation of past performance may include, but not be limited to, relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control. Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, PPIRS, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information. Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered. Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement. Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.</p>
<p>Past performance evaluation will also include the extent offerors utilized small business concerns (SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, and WOSB) under previous contracts. In addition, past performance in meeting subcontracting plan goals (applicable to large businesses) will be evaluated. PPI utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from submitted Contract Data Sheets, DCMA or any other sources which may have relevant information.</p>
<p>3) Price: The offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on price analysis. Offers will also be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before the award.</p>
<p>52.214-20 BID SAMPLES (APR 2002) - ALT II (MAY 2002)</p>
<p>(a) Bid sample means a product sample required to be submitted by a bidder to show those characteristics of the offered products that cannot adequately be described by specifications, purchase descriptions, or the invitation for bid (e.g., balance, facility of use, or pattern).</p>
<p>(b) Bidders must furnish bid samples as part of the bid. The Government must receive the bid samples by the time specified in the invitation for bids. If the bidder fails to submit samples on time, the Government will reject the bid, except that the Contracting Officer will consider a late sample sent by mail under the Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bids provision of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) The Government will test or evaluate bid samples to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed for examination in this solicitation. The Government will reject the bid when the sample fails to conform to the required characteristics. Products delivered under any resulting contract must conform to--</p>
<p>1) the approved sample for the characteristics listed for test or evaluation and<br />2) the specifications for all other characteristics.</p>
<p>(d) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, bid samples shall be (1) submitted at no expense to the Government, and (2) returned at the bidder's request and expense.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for (4) one year periods or intervals to the total price for the basic requirement.

Evaluation of one year intervals or periods shall not obligate the Government to exercise that year period or interval(s).</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. PER FAR 19, THIS WILL BE AWARDED AS AN 8(a) SOLE SOURCE.
<p><br />The base's exterior electrical system serves the North Base area of the base via one 5kV overhead circuit. This circuit is fed from Dominion Virginia Power's 5MVA transformer located just north of Facility 1358 through a 3.75MVA step down transformer. The 5kV overhead system is an old system in need of major repairs. The Base General Plan identifies multiple future facilities there that expand the base's mission with anticipated growth of 4.4 MVA. Base civil engineering proposes to add another service point on DVP's 34.5kV express feeder near the intersection of LTA Bypass and Weyland Road. The new circuit will serve the anticipated growth in this area.</p>

<DESC><p>Additional information:</p>
<p>The interior working height of the spray application booth should be 46". We need two spray guns and two drum pumps complete with all necessary regulators, gauges, and filters. All other stations should have a minimum working height of 36". All conveyors, lifts, tables, etc. must be capable of sustaining a 500# load. The developer station should have a vacuum pump with 8-foot hose and wand and be exhausted directly to the drain. The parts being inspected are of varied sizes and geometry, some simple and some complicated with voids that would make it difficult to automate the penetrant application process and ensure adequate coverage. Therefore, the application and removal stages will be done manually. The entire line should be shielded by a minimum 36" high backsplash.</p>

<p>The requirements state that the parts pallets can be up to 23" X 35". We need a minimum working height of 36" at all stations except the penetrant spray application booth, which should be 46". All conveyors, lifts, tables, etc. must be capable of sustaining a 500# load. The pre-wash/emulsify station should be a booth-type with a tank at least 27" deep. There should be a manual wash gun and hose and a manual emulsifier gun and hose. This station must also include a mechanical lift to lower and raise the pallet into and out of the tank. The booth should have an ultraviolet fluorescent light and a 750 cfm exhaust fan. Other equipment that should be standard with this type of booth should be an adjustable emulsifier injection system for solution concentrations from 0 to 5%, a water temperature gauge, and a pressure regulator and gauge.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation number is</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"> HSFEEM-09-Q-0030 and is supplemented with additional information included (Statement of Work (SOW) attached).</span><span style="font-size: 7pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"> Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 are incorporated. This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside requirement under NAICS 721110, with a Size Standard of $7.0 Million. All qualified small businesses are encouraged to submit quotes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms and conference center facilities for the requirements described in the attached SOW for participants attending the FY 2009 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) peer review in the Baltimore, MD area. DHS/FEMA has tentatively scheduled the multiple conferences for the following period: July 06-17, 2009 (2 weeks and up to 200 people, weekend in between is not included).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The requirements are hereby amended to allow for an alternate date period. The alternate period for the same services is 13 July through 24 July. Aside from the dates, there are no changes in the requirements. Vendors are encouraged to submit quotes for dates they have available for either one or both of the requested date periods. (For example, if a vendor only has availability for 06 - 17 July, then only submit one offer. Or if both periods are available, the hotel can offer 1 or&nbsp;2 quotes.) Only one will be awarded for one of the two periods. There are two vendor offer sheets provided herein. The period that will be utilized will be known on or about 02 June 09.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Baltimore area for the purposes of this solicitation includes hotels with conference centers located within an up to approximately 30-35 minute travel distance from the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 200 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details and pricing sheet). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 7 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 AFG Peer Review," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to reserve their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The resultant contract is intended to cover the price of hotel rooms occupied for the conference attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The "Conference Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which each conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms shall be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors shall also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per-night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms and conference spaces to be paid for by the Federal Government.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation number is<span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"> HSFEEM-09-Q-0030 and is supplemented with additional information included (Statement of Work (SOW) attached).</span><span style="font-size: 7pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"> Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 are incorporated. This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside requirement under NAICS 721110, with a Size Standard of $7.0 Million. All qualified small businesses are encouraged to submit quotes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms and conference center facilities for the requirements described in the attached SOW for participants attending the FY 2009 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) peer review in the Baltimore, MD area. DHS/FEMA has tentatively scheduled the multiple conferences for the following period: July 06-17, 2009 (2 weeks and up to 200 people, weekend in between is not included).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Baltimore area for the purposes of this solicitation includes hotels with conference centers located within an up to approximately 30-35 minute travel distance from the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 200 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details and pricing sheet). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 7 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 AFG Peer Review," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to reserve their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The resultant contract is intended to cover the price of hotel rooms occupied for the conference attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The "Conference Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which each conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms shall be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors shall also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per-night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms and conference spaces to be paid for by the Federal Government.

<DESC>Modification issued in response to additional inquires regarding clarification of solicitation.<BR><BR>1. You request documentation of projects of a similar scope, how many projects would you like documented? What do you consider the comparable scope of this project?<BR><BR>ANS: The number of projects is up to the vendor.  Comparable scope is an organization with roughly 1,900 employees.<BR><BR>2. Scope: How many desktops at how many sites? How many remote users, peak daily and monthly?<BR><BR>ANS: We have 1900 total employees (combination of full-time military/civilian and part-time traditional Guardsmen.)<BR><BR>3. Do you have any additional or supplemental material that could inform our response to your RFQ? <BR><BR>ANS: No.<BR><BR>4.  Timing - When do you hope to launch the new sites?  Is there a specific event driving the launch?<BR><BR>ANS: There is no specific event driving the launch.  Our expectation is that the vendor, using past experience, will provide the launch dates as part of the project schedule and milestones as required in the solicitation.<BR><BR>5. Total site portals - How many portals total should we plan do design?  What is the expected level of design customization for each?<BR> <BR>ANS: There are 4 portals as displayed in Attachment 1 (color coded black) and there are many sub-portals (pages) associated with the main portals (top level portals).  We require uniformity for each of the unit/section pages and further customization can be found at item 4 of the Deliverables.  NOTE:  Look at the provided NHKO site map and org chart for guidance.<BR><BR>6. Site owner meetings - Can you give us an idea of approximately how many site owners we would meet with?  Is it anticipated that these meetings would take place at the kick-off meeting?<BR><BR>ANS: At first blush, we should plan on the following site owner meetings:<BR><BR>NHNG:<BR>	TAG<BR>	State Business Office<BR>	PAO<BR>	JAG/IG<BR>	USPFO<BR><BR>Joint:<BR>	HRO<BR>	J3<BR>	CST<BR>	Counter Drug<BR><BR>Army:<BR>	Command<BR>	G1<BR>	G3<BR>	G4<BR>	G6<BR>	Facilities Management Office<BR>	Aviation and Safety<BR>	Brigade/54th TC<BR>	MEDCOM<BR>	Recruiting<BR>	195th Regiment<BR><BR>7. Super User Training - The synopsis states that there would be no more than 18 persons per class, but it does not tell us how many persons total.  Approximately how many training classes would we need to conduct to cover all super users?<BR><BR>ANS:  Approximately 53-55 personnel.  A representative from each of the groups above should have at least one super-user for the small entities such as TAG, State Business Office, PAO, JAG/IG, CST, Counter Drug, Army Command, Aviation & Safety, and MEDCOM, and the 195th Regiment.  Facilities, HRO, J3, G1, G3, G4, G6, FMO, and Recruiting could probably use a couple apiece.  USPFO and HRO have more moving parts and may need even more.  The 54th Troop Command and 197th Fires Brigade need someone from each of the headquarters elements and each company/battery (estimated at 19 total).<BR><BR>8.

<DESC>Amendment 001:

A001:

Questions:

1. In section 1, article 1.3 the RFP states that the consultant will develop TOR's and budgets for at least 4 studies for TDA consideration. It is unclear to me when I review that section if it means: (a) we prepare TOR's and budgets for four studies in each of the three countries, or (b) TOR's and budgets for a total of four studies among the three countries. Can you please confirm what the intention is?

Answer:

(b)  the Scope of Work requires the Contractor to develop at least four TORs and budgets total.  


Questiion:

2. Also, if the projects are to be submitted by the host government in each country, is it intended that the visits will be largely to interview individuals  nominated by the government to gain a greater understanding of their objectives, or will the consultant be expected to identify and schedule meetings with individuals/companies that could provide the required goods and services (i.e., will we be expected to develop a contact list in addition to whatever is provided by the host government)? 

Answer:

The Contractor shall meet with host country project sponsors to understand their objectives AND identify, schedule, and meet with individuals/companies that could provide the required goods and services.

Question:

3. Re, section 2.3 and the Commercial Section of the Embassy, does the Commercial Section only work with the consultants after they arrive in-country, or before their arrival to refine the contact / interview list?

Answer:

The Contractor shall keep USTDA and the Embassy apprised of its meeting schedule prior to departure, as well as meet with Embassy officials upon arrival and prior to departure back to the United States.  Embassy personnel may attend meetings with the Contractor.  In addition, the Embassy MAY be in a position to assist with meetings, but ultimately the Contractor shall be responsible for arranging all meetings.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solicitation Announcement</strong></span>:</p>
<p>This modification points out that the solicitation was posted&nbsp;on 4/15/09&nbsp;to the pre-solicitation notice (see below).&nbsp; Accordingly, all interested 8(a) firms may submit their poposals in accordance with the instructions and time/date stipulated in Section 'L' of the attached solicitation document.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Solicitation Announcement:</span></strong>&nbsp; below is the text previously included in the mandatory pre-solicitation notice:</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a),&nbsp;to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals from firms that are eligible to compete under the Small Busines Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.&nbsp; The contracting officer has determined that adequate competition among 8(a) eligible firms exists and therefore the acquisition will be competed as an 8(a) set aside.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Government will receive proposals only from such 8(a) firms and will reject any proposal received from&nbsp;firms that are not 8(a) eligible.&nbsp; This acquisition strategy decision is based upon&nbsp;the Government's evaluation of&nbsp;capability statements received in response&nbsp;to a Sources Sought Synopsis posted to FEDBIZOPS on 1/21/2009.</p>
<p>No response to this notice is requested nor required.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The purchase of (10) HP DL380 G5 servers and (2) HP DL580 G5 servers, (1) Rack Pallet and 3-Year Care Packs for each server Production at GFSC and COOP at Beltsville. [Described Above].  Teh statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2). The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-, Unusual and compelling urgency.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis.  GFSC currently uses teh IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) Baseline approval list for server specifications.  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to teh server requested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility.  It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of approved servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list.  Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchagneable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance therby reducing administrative adn operatinoal overhead when maintenance is required. By not continuing to use Hewlett Packard servers and parts GFSC would incur additional administrative and operational overhead to support different vendor hardware (i.e. differet hardware configurations, different base installation/bios/hardware anamolies, etc.) GFSC maintains three separate server farms, production, development, and continuity of operations. In support of these environments, we maintain an inventory of onsite spare parts; disk drives, network adapters, chassis and cpu fants etc. By restricting our servers to a minimial number of models and manufacturers across these three server farms, we leverage the availability of spare parts for these mission critical assets at the minimial cost to the government. Similarly this configuration control gives us the ability to rapidly replace and provision serves in the three environments utilizing server software imaging thechnology, as the source and target systems contain the same hardware. This capability is crucial to our effective remote administration of our continuity of operations facility located 575 miles away.<BR><BR>

<DESC>5/8/09 Source control drawing 1619-110A added as an attachment to this announcement.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for refurbishment of an estimated annual quantity of 45 each Encoders, NSN 5990-01-319-5667, Kevlin Corporation part number 1619-110A and Sensor Systems LLC part number VOE35-2542.  The proposed contract provides for refurbishment services in support of Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR-9) systems.  The ASR-9 radars are an integral part of the Air Traffic control system.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, with a Small Business Size Standard of $7 million.
Prior to contract award, a pre-award approval test will be conducted wherein a purchase order for refurbishment of two units will be negotiated and awarded to the vendor offering the lowest evaluated contract price.  Following in-house vendor testing of the refurbished units, the units will undergo a "bench test" by the FAA.  If the test units are approved, a contract will be awarded.
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with Firm-Fixed-Price pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  The contract will consist of one 1-year base period, plus four 1-year option periods.    
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, May 28, 2009.  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, May 28, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Orlando, FL, is seeking information regarding possible image generation solutions for the CFFT systems and potential sources that currently possess the capabilities to provide these image generation solutions.<BR><BR>PURPOSE:<BR>The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) program is conducting an analysis of image generators to determine if we should 1) continue delivering CFFT systems with the current image generators, 2) if we should integrate a new image generator into the CFFT systems that have not been delivered, or 3) if we should purchase new image generators for all CFFT systems.  The analysis will focus on 1) the capabilities of the image generator today, 2) what functionality would need to be developed to meet the program requirements, and 3) cost.  The result of the analysis will be a decision on which approach to take with the CFFT image generators and which products would best meet the requirements of the CFFT program.  If it is decided to integrate new image generators into the CFFT systems, the integration would start in October/November 2009.<BR><BR>The total number of CFFT systems to be delivered is approximately 405.  Of the 405 total systems, approximately 155 systems have been delivered to date.  These systems are delivered in 1-to-4, 1-to-12, and 1-to-30 (instructor-to-student) configurations.  The 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations require 3 image generators.  The 1-to-30 configurations require 4 image generators.  There will be a total of 33 1-to-30 configurations delivered.  The remaining systems will be 1-to-4 and 1-to-12.<BR><BR>For the 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations, an image generator is required for the enhanced student station which provides Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) views; a second image generator for the Stealth system at the Instructor Operators Station; and the third image generator for the rendered real-world scene projected on a classroom screen.  The 1-to-30 configuration has an additional image generator for additional field-of-view on the classroom screen to accommodate the larger student number.<BR><BR>The key parameters that will determine the approach the program takes are the following:<BR>"	Low cost visual system<BR>"	Reduce Life Cycle cost<BR>"	Leverage SE CORE database generation and models<BR>"	Compliance to the JFPL Standards<BR>"	Integration schedule compliance<BR>  <BR>INFORMATION SOUGHT:<BR><BR>Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following:<BR><BR>a.	Completed Vendor IG Response Table. (Attachment A below)<BR>b.	A statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015.<BR>c.	A statement indicating whether the firm is a large or small business (if small, please indicate any applicable socio-economic status such as Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a), HUB Zone, etc) under NAICS 541330, if they are interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, and if they are planning to team with other companies for this contract.<BR><BR>The response is limited to paragraphs a-c above and should not exceed six (6) pages.  Any additional information will be discarded without review.   The information provided needs to define the current functionality/capabilities of the product that you would recommend to this program.  At this time no cost information is being requested.  A point of contact for the CFFT team can speak to concerning your product and costing of the product is requested.<BR> <BR>It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document no later than 3:30PM EST via email to adam.baldwin@us.army.mil on or before May 29, 2009.  <BR><BR>This Request for Information is being posted on both the PEO STRI Business Opportunities Portal (STRI BOP) and to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).

The lease term requirement is for ten years/five years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy immediately.  The building must be located within the Salem, Oregon city limits. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>Reference is made to the April 23, 2009 announcement, reference number 200951015A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Colombia - Port of Salgar Terminal Rehabilitation Feasibility Study.
This is to notify interested U.S. firms of the following request/response for clarification to the Colombia - Port of Salgar Terminal Rehabilitation Feasibility Study
QUESTION 1: 
The Terms of Reference contain a requirement to 1.2 Inspect existing marine structural conditions, including areas above and below water level.  Measurements, using nondestructive means shall be made on all structures and in areas showing visual deterioration
Underwater measurements are expensive, require the use of divers, and are not included in the DM cost estimates.  Estimating the condition of subsurface structures without diving can be done using gaffs to probe structural elements that can be accessed from the surface.  This method would provide a general estimate of the condition of underwater structural members, however be limited to those structural elements that can be seen and accessed from the surface and measurements taken would be only rough estimates.  It may be useful to change this requirement to   1.2 Inspect existing marine structural conditions, including areas above and below water level that can be detected and accessed while on the surface.  Inspections shall be nondestructive and shall provide an estimate as to their general condition.
ANSWER 1
The use of hooks (gaffs) to inspect the piling is not sufficient and unreliable.  It is important to conduct tests using ultrasound equipment to measure piling thickness and corrosion (continuity and extent).  These tests would be conducted above and below water level at randomly selected sites, making two or three measurements at each vertical, at a representative number of pilings (8 to 10) so that the results are demonstrative.  The water depth is quite shallow and using ultrasonic measurements is quite simple and inexpensive.  It can be done from the deck by scraping the sheetpiles with a brush on a long handle.  There are devices that can be rented for the measurements and there are firms that can do this work in Colombia.
QUESTION 2
The Terms of Reference contain a requirement to1.3 Determine bathymetric measurements at the facility and adjacent water areas.  Adjacent water areas shall encompass the width of the river and one (1) kilometer upstream and downstream of the facility.
Unless the intent was to have the contractor conduct a bathymetric study (which is not in the DM budget) and would not be conclusive since it would only capture readings during one isolated season it may be useful to change this requirement to Review existing bathymetric readings and/or other records of river conditions to assess the affect that seasonal changes may have on river traffic
ANSWER 2
The TOR calls for a bathymetric survey and the survey area was purposely limited in the TOR.  It can be done with a small boat and side-scan sonar tied into a GPS, a common procedure in marine construction that can be used to determine the water depths and give a rough approximation of the subsurface soils.  In addition, it is essential that the previous surveys be reviewed and analyzed, especially in order to comply with the provisions of paragraph 3.1.2, which are as follows:
3.1.2  Limitations for barges to operate at the terminal considering navigational and water level restrictions, including but not limited to alignments and changes, water depths and seasonal variations, night time, and servicing.  Include present situation and proposed improvements.

<SUBJECT>Brazil: PROAERO Small Airports Network Program Expansion Plan
<SOLNBR>200851019B
<RESPDATE>051809
<CONTACT>John Kusnierek, Phone (703) 875-4357, Email jkusnierek@ustda.gov
<DESC>There will be no additional extensions to the deadline
Q1) For the Technical Assistance, do you expect detailed planning for the airports or broad strategic planning for Proacesso?
A1) Task 2 in the Terms of Reference requires an evaluation and revision of the long-term strategic plan (2009-2029), an update to the actual implementation program, among other activities.  SETOP recognizes that because of the timeline and resources, a complete reevaluation and update to the long-term plan may not be possible, but we understand that the planning of Proaero for at least the period 2009-2014 is possible (2014 is the end of the term for the next state govt.)
Q2) For Task 3, what are the objectives of the Workshops?
A2) At this time, SETOP would like for the Workshops to be technical in nature (with the objective of presenting engineering best practices, new equipment, etc) as well as cover management (airport administration best practices, best practices for administration of small and medium-sized airports, cargo airport experience, etc..)
Q3) Will the Aviation Plan of the State of Minas Gerais (PAEMG) be revised?
A3) No, PAEMG should be taken into account and should be a source of information used to establish some parameters.  Since the work to completely update this plan is so complex and requires field studies of each airport, only the beginnings of an update to this plan are expected.
Q4) Will the municipalities mantain the airports in the Proaero Program?
A3) The responsibilities for the maintenance may be either of the State Government or the Municipalities, currently there are no defined rules on this.  SETOP would like one of the tasks of this Technical Assistance to be to define how the airports should be managed, helping to create administration models, including possibilities for private concession or Public Private Partnerships.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<ARCHDATE>06092009
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a noncompetitive contract to Mr. John M. Russell to provide Special Coordinator Services for the Future of Babylon Initiative.
This purchase will be made as an Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The anticipated award date is 22 June 09. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
The justification for this sole source procurement is for the research and analysis on the current condition of the ancient site of Babylon. The recipient will work as principal consulting officer with the NGO contractor in the execution of the Babylon initiative and will act as the Contracting Officers Technical representative. He will oversee the operations involved in coordinating and monitoring the project initiatives to be completed by the contract end date. He will maintain contact with UNESCO to monitor and coordinate other heritage projects in Iraq and will respond to U.S. Customs and other law enforcement agency inquiries with regard to Iraqi antiquities.
Dr. Russell is an archaeologist specializing in the Near East. He is one of the few Americans who have carried out field work in Iraq and the only American to have spent nine months in Baghdad as the Coalition Provisional Authoritys Senior Advisor to Iraqs Ministry of Culture to advance cultural heritage issues in Iraq. Dr. Russell is intimately familiar with cultural heritage issues in Iraq and has a strong professional relationship with Iraqis who serve in the Ministry and the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.
Market Research was not conducted because of an immediate need to identify the individual with highly specialized skills to fill this position.
