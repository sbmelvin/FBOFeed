<p>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management (AQM) intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for the acquisition of Firebird Model Computer Driven Fire Training Simulators to Surrey Fire Safety House, the Master US Distributor for the Pyrosoft Simulators. Pyrosoft is a proprietary manufacturer. The proposed purchase order is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>The Pyrosoft simulator was chosen because it is the only manufacturer that offers a totally customizable simulator with properties for any type of fire including electrical, fuel, 3 dimensional and location. It is also the only unit that is capable of video editing techniques to create our own fire scenes for Embassy and Consulate specific scenarios. Lastly this is the only training system that is compatible with the Ansul ABC external cartridge operated type fire extinguishers used by the State Department offices and residences worldwide.</p>

The daily cost will include all expenses including mileage, per diem, supplies used by consultant, lodging, and taxes.  

Travel costs incurred for transportation, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (as defined in the regulation cited in FAR 31.205-46) shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR).

All travel shall be approved, by the COTR, prior to commencement of travel. Consultant shall provide supporting documentation and a detailed breakdown of incurred travel costs with each invoice. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>
<p><br />Awardee will be required to submit a Certificate of Liability Insurance within 5 business days following award notification from the Great Plains Indian Health Service.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Architectural-Engineering (A-E) services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete Military/IIS projects and Civil works projects as secondary. Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Divisions military boundaries of CA, NV, UT and AZ and the civil works boundaries of CA, NV, AZ, UT, and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY. The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility. Use of the contracts outside the above areas of responsibility is subject to the review and approval of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The A-E services required under this contract may range in scope from planning/design studies supporting programming/budgetary documents, technical feasibility studies, alternatives development, engineering optimization evaluations, design quality review services, design-build requirements packages, to a new project design for Military and IIS and Civil Works Projects.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this contract is to provide design services in support of the Military and IIS Programs. Projects will typically be smaller (Programmed amounts in $500K to $3 million range typically), and of lesser overall complexity. Projects under the Military Program will typically be funded by the Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) program. The design services could range from an architectural renovation (some of historical significance), maintenance and repair of a variety of small projects, ECIP Program studies/designs (more detail below), or may also include design of complete additions, alterations, or new facility designs for Military projects such as barracks, warehouses, storage facilities, administrative facilities, training facilities, maintenance facilities, aircraft hangars, computer facilities, aircraft runways, taxiways, aprons, treatment plants, and the entire spectrum of infrastructure (road and utility) systems. Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) projects (a subset of Army Milcon Program) include energy reduction and renewable energy projects, including but not limited to: photovoltaic, wind, microgrids, energy management control systems (EMCS) and water conservation. Demolition of existing facilities may be required which will necessitate asbestos and or lead based paint investigation with provisions for removal included in the design documents. Design services may also be required to support the Interagency and International Services (IIS) Program providing technical assistance to non-Department of Defense (DoD) federal agencies, state and local governments, tribal nations, private U.S. firms, international organizations, and foreign governments. Typical agencies requiring design or design review support could be the Dept of Veterans Affairs (medical and administrative type facilities), EPA, Customs and Border Protection, and DOE.</p>
<p>Design services may also include support of the Civil Works Program. Civil Works project studies and designs could involve levees, floodwalls, dams, spillways, various mechanical gate structures, pumping stations, stilling basins, hydraulic flow control structures, and bridges. Civil Works studies may include, but not be limited to, the evaluation of flood damage, preparation of engineering analysis, acquisition of topographic and hydrographic data, and environmental restoration to include wetlands development.</p>

<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria" a" through "d" are primary. Criteria "e" through "f" are secondary and will only be used as tiebreakers among technically equal firms.</p>
<p>a. Specialized Experience and technical competence. The A-E must provide examples of not more than ten (10) projects completed within the last 5 years that best demonstrate specialized experience and technical competency in the areas listed below. Project examples submitted should be of completed projects. All projects cited must identify start/complete dates as well as the project size (cost and scope). Please also provide the percentage of work completed by the prime contractor. <br /><br />Prime Contractor's that do not have specific experience in the following types of tasks will be evaluated based on their subcontractors' experience. However, projects where the prime performed 50% or more of the work with in-house forces will be weighted more heavily than projects performed predominantly by proposed subcontractors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Capability and recent experience in Military or IIS project studies and designs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involving facilities such as: barracks, warehouses, storage facilities, administrative facilities, medical facilities, training facilities, maintenance facilities, aircraft hangers, aircraft runways/taxiways/aprons, roadways, utilities, energy reduction and renewable energy projects. Experience with conceptual level studies/design for programming purposes, preparation of Design Build requirement packages, as well as final design (plans and specification for construction) is preferred.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Capability and experience with services in support of design, such as acquisition of geotechnical (explorations), topographic survey, utility survey, material testing results, design reviews (quality control and constructability), economic analysis, life cycle cost analysis, environmental documents and assessment of environmental impacts, cost engineering (using MCACES), GIS and CADD/BIM capability.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Work experience within the South Pacific Division boundaries, and particularly inside the Sacramento District boundaries will be considered in determining the most highly qualified firms.</p>
<p>b. Firms must demonstrate professional and specialized experience for key disciplines. Evaluation of professional qualifications will consider education, training, certifications, registration, relevant experience and longevity with the firm of key technical personnel (3-year minimum is preferable). Project related experience of new employees with the firm will be considered. Experience in the discipline in which he/she will be working on should be identified. (SF 330, Part I, Sections E and G).</p>
<p>Qualified professional personnel who are certified, registered and highly trained in the following key disciplines: Project Management, Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical, Mechanical, Geotechnical, Landscape Architect, Cost Engineering, Topographic Surveys, LEED Accredited Professionals, Geographic Information Specialist, CADD/BIM (Revit) Operator, Environmental Specialist and Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH).</p>
<p>c. Past performance of the Prime A-E firm must be provided on all projects submitted in section a. above, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence criteria. The prime A-E firm shall provide a reference using the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), attached to this announcement, and/or a final Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) report. The prime A-E is responsible for forwarding the PPQ to each past performance reference submitted under this synopsis. The submitting A-E firm should complete blocks 1-4 of the PPQ and the client/customer should complete blocks 5-8 and the evaluation survey. The client/customer should return the PPQ to the firm to be submitted with the SF330 or send, via email, the PPQ directly to the Government point of contact identified in this synopsis. PPIRS may be queried for all prime, Joint Venture (JV) and key subcontractors. In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance. In the event that adverse past performance information is obtained outside the PPIRS query and the A-E firm did not have the opportunity to respond, the A-E firm will have the opportunity to respond. Or if the adverse past performance is the reason why the firm is not selected as one of the most highly qualified, the A-E firm will have the opportunity to comment. If CPARS evaluations are not available or are so sparse no meaningful rating can be reasonably assigned, the A-E firm will be assigned "neutral" rating and shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>d. Capacity to accomplish multiple simultaneous task orders at different locations within the required timeframe, including professional qualifications of firm's staff and subcontractors to be assigned to the projects which are necessary for satisfactory performance in the required time.

  (b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.

  (c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
 (End of provision)

52.209-5 REPRESENTATION BY CORPORATIONS REGARDING AN UNPAID TAX LIABILITY OR A FELONY CONVICTION UNDER ANY FEDERAL LAW (DEVIATION)(MAR 2012)
  (a) In accordance with Division H, sections 8124 and 8125 of P.L. 112-74 and sections 738 and 739 of P.L. 112-55 none of the funds made available by either Act may be used to enter into a contract with any corporation that-

     (2) Has a felony criminal violation under any Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months, unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and Suspension and Debarment Official has made a determination that this action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.
  (b) The Offeror represents that-
        (1) The offeror does [  ] does not [  ] have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed and that is  not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability.
        (2) The offeror, its officers or agents acting on its behalf have [  ] have not [  ] been convicted of a felony criminal violation under a Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months.


52.204-16  COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY CODE REPORTING (JUL 2015)
  (a) Definition. As used in this provision-
  Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code means-
    (1) An identifier assigned to entities located in the United States or its outlying areas by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch to identify a commercial or Government entity; or
    (2) An identifier assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or by the NATO Support Agency (NSPA) to entities located outside the United States and its outlying areas that the DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an NCAGE code.
  (b) The Offeror shall enter its CAGE code in its offer with its name and address or otherwise include it prominently in its proposal. The CAGE code entered must be for that name and address. Enter "CAGE" before the number. The CAGE code is required prior to award.
  (c) CAGE codes may be obtained via-
    (1) Registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. If the Offeror is located in the United States or its outlying areas and does not already have a CAGE code assigned, the DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch will assign a CAGE code as a part of the SAM registration process. SAM registrants located outside the United States and its outlying areas shall obtain a NCAGE code prior to registration in SAM (see paragraph (c)(3) of this provision).
    (2) The DLA Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch. If registration in SAM is not required for the subject procurement, and the offeror does not otherwise register in SAM, an offeror located in the United States or its outlying areas may request that a CAGE code be assigned by submitting a request at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp.
    (3) The appropriate country codification bureau. Entities located outside the United States and its outlying areas may obtain an NCAGE code by contacting the Codification Bureau in the foreign entity's country if that country is a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. NCAGE codes may be obtained from the NSPA if the foreign entity's country is not a member of NATO or a sponsored nation. Points of contact for codification bureaus and NSPA, as well as additional information on obtaining NCAGE codes, are available at 
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/nato/ObtainCAGE.asp.
  (d) Additional guidance for establishing and maintaining CAGE codes is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp.
  (e) When a CAGE Code is required for the immediate owner and/or the highest-level owner by 52.204-17 or 52.212-3(p), the Offeror shall obtain the respective CAGE Code from that entity to supply the CAGE Code to the Government.
  (f) Do not delay submission of the offer pending receipt of a CAGE code.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.209-10, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015).

The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.
2. Imports: Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number.  The following documentation is required for all import shipments:

a. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments).  In the consignee block, type in ?US Military?.  This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA). b. Shipping Invoices. c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. d. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker. e.

Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles.	 f. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA.  If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract.  If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract. g. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity.  Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA. <BR> <BR>3.  Exports:  The following documentation is required for all export shipments: 
a. An original CCR prepared by the COR.  If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR. b. Invoices. c. Packing Lists.  Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. d.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.
