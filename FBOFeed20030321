<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for Protected Airspace Surveillance System study for National Airspace System (NAS). This requirement consists of the Protected Airspace Surveillance System (PASS) for NAS Security, including Airspace Surveillance Systems Assessment and Protected Airspace Surveillance System Technology Gap Analysis. The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a competitive down selection process.  Phase I for this acquisition includes Protected Airspace Surveillance System study, assessment and Gap Analysis for NAS.  Based upon Phase I results, (i.e. Concept feasibility, Implementation cost) the most promising concepts will be selected for simulation and modeling, in Phase II. Phase II competition and ultimate selection will be based on Phase I results. Award criteria for phase II is included in the Request for Offer, and includes results and recommendations included in the Phase I Final report.  The Government anticipates that only Phase I Contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the Phase II simulation and modeling. A proposal for Phase II activity for the simulation and modeling will be requested in the RFO, and finalized as an addendum to the Phase I final report. The Government does not intend to issue a new solicitation for Phase II. This acquisition, is, therefore a “progressive competition” as defined in the NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7301-5, and all pertinent Phase II information (Statements of Work, Proposal Instructions and Evaluation Criteria) are described in the RFO.  Before proceeding to Phase II, the acquisition will be synopsized in accordance with Part 5.201 and 5.203 of the FAR. Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase Contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase, proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  In order to contend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective Offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to the prior phase Contractors.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated for Phase I with a cost reimbursable type contract anticipated for Phase II. The Government may elect to award multiple contracts to two or more Offerors under this solicitation for the Phase I Protected Airspace Surveillance System Description and Assessment. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500, respectively. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9. The provisions and clauses in the RFO and model contract are those in effect through FAC 01-12. All qualified  responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about April 7, 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about May 7, 2003. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, is soliciting proposals for the creation and maintenance of a research colony of mice to evaluate potential intervention strategies that may decelerate the rate of aging in mammals.  The objective of the project is to evaluate a standing colony of genetically defined laboratory mice by comparing aging in control groups and experimental groups provided specific interventions.  Efficacy of the selected interventions compared to control values would be evaluated by scientists involved in the project according to the following criteria:  1) extends both mean and maximum lifespan; 2) delays the onset and reduces the incidence of age-related pathology; 3) maintains physiological and behavioral function into late life.

This colony shall be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are routinely monitored and characterized for disease status and provided specified treatments as necessary.  A special requirement for this project is that the location of the mice and space for the project shall not exceed 1-hour driving time from the Gerontology Research Center (GRC), located at 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, Baltimore, MD 21224.  

A seven-year, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is anticipated, with award made on or about September 30, 2003.  The solicitation will be issued on or about March 7, 2003 and will be posted on this website and at http://ocm.od.nih.gov/drc/rfp.htm.  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking these websites for any amendments to the solicitation.  Proposals will be due approximately two months after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>Under authority of U.S.C. 253©(1), FAR 6.302-1, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland intends to procure from Highway Information Systems, 4021 Stirrup Creek Dr., Durham, NC  27703, a Highway Radio Advisory System.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561621, and the business size is $6.0.  This system shall include, but not be limited to, and meet or exceed the following performance characteristics, features, and pertain to the following components:  (1)  This HAR system will consist of a low power AM radio transmitter system together with various message signs (VMS) located on campus and flashing beacon signals located off-campus.  Both the VMS and flashing beacon signs will be portable and be able to be transported throughout the campus or off-campus locations and be electronically controlled from one of two workstations.  (2)  The low power AM radio will have a feature that permits messages to be broadcast by a pre-recorded message, or in a "live" mode.  The pre-recorded option allows for one message or by periodically cycling through a series of messages.  Messages can be changed remotely from either a touch-tone telephone or by computer.  (3)  The broadcast range is usually four to six miles away.  This range allows NIH to maximize the target audience on major traffic arteries serving the campus.  (4)  Messages are played in a continuous loop and will last from one to three minutes in duration.  Under normal conditions, a motorist should be able to listen to two messages while passing through the broadcast zone.  The message could include special event information, parking information, and more importantly, emergency information.  Because the transmitter broadcasts on the AM radio band, virtually every car radio is able to receive the signal.  The radio broadcast can be directly linked to several variable message signs (VMS) that could be mounted in several locations on the NIH campus.  VMS signs, in conjunction with the radio broadcasts, permit traffic advisories to be sent without delay.  The VMS sign would direct motorists entering the campus to designated parking areas in the event of a special event.   VMS signs placed at exit locations could direct motorists to alternative exit portals.  In the event of an emergency, the VMS signs could assist motorists with appropriate advisory messages.  (5)  These signs are legible from 650' to 700' and are visible from 1000'.  (6)  The signs are acceptable for use as provided for by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).  (7)  The system can be used on a daily basis as an information source for employees.  In the event that NIH needed to be evacuated, it will be an effective component of the NIH evacuation plan to safely help guide individuals from the campus in an orderly fashion.  (8)  Also, another component of the system potentially allows it to be utilized as a security alerting system.  This feature may be tied into a network of real time monitors that are observed by the ECC staff.  If problems are observed, the ECC can swiftly activate the appropriate message for commuters.  (9)  It is anticipated that flashing beacons and alert signs will be placed on major traffic arteries leading to the NIH campus.  For example, placement of a beacon/sign along the Capital Beltway will advise motorists of traffic problems leading onto the campus so that motorists can alter their route and continue to the campus with minimal disruption.  Future coordination efforts and approvals may be required from the Maryland State Highway Administration, Office of Traffic and Safety, or other local jurisdictions such as the Montgomery County Department of Public Works and Transportation.  These will be initiated in order to erect signs at off-campus locations during deployment periods.  (10)  To activate the flashing beacon lights, a 900-megahertz paging system must be utilized.  The NIH radio shop through our CIT group can support these capabilities.  (11)  The VMS signs can be controlled remotely through a cellular modem or cellular digital packet data (CDPD) modem, our CIT group can provide this service in-house.  The communication link to be used will be determined based on available cellular CDPD coverage areas for VMS deployment.  (12)  The radio system must not interfere with any of the current NIH radio systems that are in place.  Additionally, it must not interfere with any of the scientific equipment that is continuously being used in the main hospital or in any of the laboratory buildings on the NIH campus.  (13)  The antenna and grounding system must be properly installed.  NIH will be working closely with the manufacturer and having the CIT radio shop personnel work directly with vendor during all planning and installation phases to prevent interference.  (14)  To operate the HAR system on the NIH Campus, the following equipment is necessary: (a)  Hiway Max Pole-Mounted, Dial-up HAR AM Broadcast System with Battery Backup, (b)  Portable VuPointe 450 Variable Message Sign with high efficiency amber light providing twenty-four (24) character display in a 3 X 8 matrix, (c)  Central Control Software Package and includes license for 1 workstation operating as a stand-alone system, (d)  Central Control Software upgrade to allow for the control of the National Sign manufactured variable message sign, (e)  HIS On-Site Computer Engineering Services Installation Package.  This includes on-site installation and one-day of training on operation of softwareand (f)  HIS Technical Support for three year service contract;  and (15)  to expand the HAR onto local commuting arteries, the following beacon system and signs would need to be incorporated Flashing Beacon System for roadway sign and Roadside "Tune to Alert" Signage and capable of being operated by two separate work stations, all controlled by one computer software package.  HIS will handle all FCC licensing requirements for the NIH.  Concerns that respond to this synopsis shall furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit capability statements in an ORIGINAL PLUS TWO (2) no later than fifteen (15) business days from the date of this announcement.  Written responses shall include complete description of the equipment to be provided, containing sufficient technical information to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the stated requirements as listed above.  CAPBILITY STATEMENTS SHALL BE SENT TO:  (a)  If mailing your capabilities through the U.S. Postal Service use the following address:  National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations, OA, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rom 529-T, ATTN:  Carol Hayden, Bethesda, MD  20892, telephone:  301-402-3340; fax:  301-402-7494.

Point Reyes is located on the California coast, approximately 40 miles northwest of San Francisco.  The business location within the park is at Drakes Beach and operates within the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center complex.  Its location is approximately 16 miles west of the town of Point Reyes Station.  The operation consists of a snack bar providing hot foods, sandwiches, hot and cold beverages and other snack items.  The operation is year round in nature. The annual gross receipts are between $123,000-$111,000.  The average annual visitation to Drakes Beach ranges between 277,000-240,000. The new concession contract will be for 10 years. The National Park Service has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR Part 51, Subpart F, that the new concession contract is a qualified concession contract and the anticipated annual gross receipts are not expected to exceed $500,000 in the first 12 months.  As a satisfactory operator, the existing concessionner is a preferred offeror and has a statutory preferential right of renewal to the award of a qualified (new) concession contract as provided for in PL 105-391, Section 403 and 36 CFR 51, Subpart E. Under the right of preference, if the proposal submitted by the existing concessioner is not selected as the best proposal, the National Park Service will advise the existing concessioner of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal that the existing concessioner must match.  If the existing concessioner does so (by amendment of its proposal) within the time allowed, it will be selected for award of the concession contract.  If it does not, then the offeror that submitted the best proposal will be selected for award of the contract.  The cost for purchasing a prospectus is $40.00 by mail or $35.00 if picked up in person at the below address.   Parties interested in obtaining a prospectus should mail or bring a check or money order in person (NO CASH SALES) made payable to "National Park Service".  A Tax Identification Number (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) must be provided on all checks. Prospectus copies can be obtained at the following address: National Park Service, Pacific West Regional Office, Office of Concession Program Management, 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, California 94607.  If purchased by mail, the front of the envelope should be marked "ATTENTION: OFFICE OF CONCESSION PROGRAM MANAGEMENT -- MAILROOM DO NOT OPEN".  You must include in your request  for the prospectus a delivery address that will accept a Federal Express package.  Inquiries on purchasing a prospectus may be directed to Mr. Mac Foreman, Office of Concession Program Management at (510) 817-1368.   An electronic copy of the prospectus will NOT be available on the internet.  The prospectus, when issued, will contain information on the business opportunity, the new concession contract, the proposal package and terms and conditions under which the National Park Service will award the new concession contract.

<DESC>NA This requirement is sole source to DriverTech Inc., 2212 S. West Temple #48, Salt Lake City, UT  84115. The PM has been directed by Department of the Army (DA) to develop an Army-wide solution for emplacing embedded diagnostics on all surface Army Systems.   The PM's solution consists of a unit to be mounted on the host platform that performs similar functions and will use similar software. The use of DriverTech's DT-3000 reduces the cost and risk to the government as it was developed and interfaced to the F amily of Medium-Sized Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), the subject vehicle of the proof of principle for testing our software.  In addition, market research performed in May 2002 revealed that the DT-3000 is diagnostics orientated and the general hardware of the system is most similar to the hardware requirements for the PM's solution specification.  As a result of the market research, we feel that DriverTech is the only company that can satisfy agency requirements at this time. Contact Jacqueline Cole, Contract S pecialist, (256) 876-6117, Debra K. Long, Contracting Officer, (256) 876-4153.  The closing date is 31 March 2003, 02:00 PM CST.  See Note 22

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lynx Therapeutics, Inc., Hayward, CA 94545,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for the purchase of 1) Generation of Megaclone Library and 2) Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) of 1 million signature tags.  NIEHS will submit two (2) samples to Lynx Therapeutics.  The work to be conducted is based on Lynx Therapeutics unique and proprietary cloning procedure called Megaclone.  This patented technology transforms a sample containing millions of DNA molecules into one made up of millions of micro-beads, each of which carries approx. 100,000 copies of one of the DNA molecules in the sample.  In contrast to conventional cloning, in which an individual DNA molecule is selected from a sample and amplified into many copies for analysis or identification, Lynx Therapeutics captures on one set of micro-beads, clones of nearly all the DNA sequences that characterize a sample.  Once the DNA is attached to the micro-beads, the clones can be handled and subjected to MPSS which generates simultaneously, from a million or more Megaclone micro-beads, sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample's DNA molecules.  This patented, proprietary technology enables many analyses or characterizations to be conducted.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Lynx Therapeutics, Inc.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M..  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

SCOPE AND EFFECT:  All financial, statistical, personnel, and technical data which is furnished or otherwise available to the contractor during the performance of this contract are considered confidential business information and shall not be used for purposes other than performance of work under this contract nor be released by the contractor without prior written consent of the Director of the Navy Refractive Surgery Center NMCSD.

DRUG USE:  The Secretary of the Navy has determined that the illegal possession or use of drugs and paraphernalia in a military setting contributes directly to military drug abuse and undermines command efforts to eliminate drug abuse among military personnel.  The policy of the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is to deter and detect drug offenses on military installations.  Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulations issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.  10.  FAILURE TO PERFORM:  Should the contractor be unable to perform duties under this contract due to medical or physical disability for more than 13 consecutive days or because of questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct, performance under this contract may be suspended by the contracting officer until such medical or physical disability is resolved, or until such questions concerning competency, ethics, or conduct have been resolved.  If performance under the contract is so suspended, no compensation or reimbursement shall accrue to the contractor so long as performance is suspended.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

A decision on the acquisition approach has been approved in conjunction with the SBA Central Office and SBA Washington District 0353, and has been approved as a Competitive 8(a) set-aside under $3 million. This decision has been cancelled due to insufficient 8(a) companies showing an interest in this requirement and market research conducted.  The IFB will be issued as a total (100%) set aside for Small Businesses.

<DESC>NA An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to provide topographic survey services various locations within the Corps of Engineers North Atlantic Division (NAD) Boundaries, with most projects primarily within the six New England States. 1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  IDIQ Contract that will provide for the capability to issue a series of task orders with the total contract not to exceed $150,000 in one calendar year.  At the option of the Government, this contract may be extended for two addi tional one-year periods.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code governing this procurement is 541360, with a size standard of $4,000,000.00 in annual sales and receipts for the three preceding fiscal years. 2.  PROJECT INFORMATION: General land surveying and mapping services at various locations in NAD (primarily New England).  Task orders may include the recovery, with measurements and descriptions identifying exact locations, of field monuments and remonume ntation of various project boundaries, field book work, property descriptions, computing of coordinates, and property line delineations or topographic surveying of specified areas.  A limited amount of small-scale hydrographic surveying may be required in conjunction with topographic/property line surveys.  Maps must be submitted in hard copy report format, hard copy Al size drawings, and Microstation 3-D design file (DGN) version 5.0 or later format.  3.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Specialized Selection Criteria for this contract, in descending order of importance, are: a. The firm must have on its staff or provide through a consultant(s), personnel with professional surveyor registration in all six New Engla nd District states (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, & RI).  Assignments may be given in the remaining seven North Atlantic Division states (NY, NJ, PA, MD, DL, WV, & VA) and the District of Columbia.  However, a statement declaring your firm's intent to obtain these r egistrations, if required, will be sufficient. Firms not demonstrating these requirements will be disqualified from further consideration.  b.  Firms must demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in:  (1) topographic surveying for constr uction reference planes using Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) and conventional survey techniques; (2) Static/kinematic DGPS equipment capable of subcentimeter measurement accuracy, electronic total station with data collector (firms must own  or lease this equipment); (3) CADD/SIS data processing equipment and have the ability to deliver CADD drawings in Microstation 3-D Design File (DGN), version 5.0 to 7.0 digital format.  The Government will only accept this format without conversion or-ref ormatting in the target CADD software format and on the target platform specified herein.  The target platform is a PC with a Windows 2000 operating system.   c.  Knowledge of USGS and state plan coordinate systems in all six New England states.  d.  Firm must be Hazardous, Toxic and Radiological Waste (HTRW) qualified for level C sites.  Qualifications of personnel, including current training certification, medical surveillance forms, etc., must be included.   e.  Firm must be of sufficient size to field t wo survey parties, if needed, simultaneously for work under this contract.  One should be a 6-man HTRW crew along with a second 3-man topographic crew.  f. Demonstrate knowledge of federal and state requirements for the entire New England District (NAE) ar ea.  g. The firm must have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. h. The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.    Secondary Selection Criteria: 	a. SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a per centage of the total  anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	b. Geographic Proximity. Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proximity should normally only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  It will have very little bearing on this sel ection. 	c. Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.  4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit four copies of SF 255 (11/92 edition), and four copies of SF 254 (11/92 edition) to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, ATTN:  A-E Uni t, 696 Virginia Road, Concord MA  01742-2751.  Submissions are due not later than 4:30 PM on the April 16, 2003.  Four copies of SF 254 are also required for each proposed consultant.  It should be noted that SF255s are not required for proposed consultant s.  Include ACASS number in Section 2b.of the SF255.  Call the ACASS Center at 503-808-4591 to obtain a number.  In Section 10 of the SF 255 describe the firm's overall design quality management plan, including management approach, coordination of discipli nes and subcontractors, and quality control procedures that must include an independent technical review.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>CORRECTION:  The term 'HG' was changed to 'HD' (a mustard gas) in footwear requirement '(A)'.  RFI:  The following Request for Information is issued for the purposes of updating market research and encouraging commercial companies to provide information on chemical/biological (CB) protective overboots.  This request is in support of the Marine Corps Systems Command's (MARCORSYSCOM) ALTERNATIVE FOOTWEAR SOLUTIONS (AFS) project.  The AFS project, a subset of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) program, goal is to determine the availability or potential development of a chemical/biological (CB) protective overboot that requires less volume/package space than the overboots currently in use by the Joint Services, and that can also be manufactured for proper fit over the joint service's boot population with significantly fewer sizes than overboots in the current inventory.  In other words, one size of an overboot should fit properly, without being bulky or too small, over a range of service-boot sizes. The development of an overboot that requires less volume is necessary to lighten the carrying weight and placement burdens on the individual warfighter, as well as to improve/lessen the overall storage and transportation requirements of CB overboots.  A minimal number of overboot sizes that still ensure proper fit is necessary:  (1) to improve the efficiency of the logistics actions necessary to ship, store, maintain and replace CB overboots, and (2) to enable more efficient vendor production and distribution costs which will result in lower costs to the Joint Services.  Requirements of the desired less volume/package space overboot with fewer sizes follow.  The footwear must:  (A) Provide 24 hours of protection while exposed to a liquid challenge of 10gm/m2 (HD,TGD,VX) or a  vapor/aerosol challenge of 5,000ct (HD,TGD,VX).  (B) Provide the same protection level identified in 
'(A)' even after 45 days of wear that did not involve exposure to CB challenges.  (C) Meet or closely approach the desired footwear volume/package space of less than 0.105 cubic feet.  (D) Be compatible with combat footwear of the Joint Services, fitting, at a minimum, the middle 90-percent of the range of combined women's and men's sizes placed in order of smallest to largest--in other words, overboot sizes are not required to fit 5 percent of each tail in the range (one tail being the smallest women's sizes and the other being the largest men's sizes); however, to fit the stipulated 90-percent range, a total of no more than four overboot sizes would be preferable.  (E) Have a shelf life of at least 5 years, but preferably 10 years.  (F) Be of sufficient height to interface with the accompanying protective overgarments.  (G) Provide improved traction over the existing Green Vinyl Overboot, the Black Vinyl Overboot, and the Chemical Protective Footwear Cover.  (H) Contain a non-snagging closure system.  (I) Be mildew, fungus, petroleum, oil, lubricant and saltwater resistant.  (J) Not degrade mission performance.  (K) Be able to be donned/doffed while wearing CB gloves, mask and overgarment.  (L) Be capable of being decontaminated to an operationally safe level.  Vendors capable of providing viable solutions are invited to submit responses to this notice to the Marine Corps Systems Command CTQ3DBR, ATTN: Doris Ragsdale, 3041A McCawley Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134 by COB 3 April 2003.  Telephonic responses will not be accepted.  Responses should include three copies of documentation that supports this determination.  If products capable of meeting these anticipated requirements are already available, vendors are encouraged to provide two pair of their overboots as representative samples along with their written documentation.  The information submitted may be used in the preparation of subsequent requests for proposals; however, no solicitation exists at this time.  The publication of this request or subsequent submission of product information shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government for vendors to procure equipment or to take any other action regarding this request for footwear information.  Firms should refer questions to the Contract Specialist, Doris Ragsdale, at (703) 432-3271 or ragsdaledb@mcsc.usmc.mil.  All information submitted by each firm will be treated as proprietary, but will be shared with MKI Systems, Sverdrup, and Battelle following receipt of a non-disclosure agreement from each of these three companies.  The Government does not intend to pay for or otherwise reimburse for information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>NA DESC: The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Aircraft Flare Parachute LUU-2c/B, NSN 1370-01-483-2406. Both the Air force and Navy use this aircraft-launched flare for nighttime illumination of surface are as in search and attack operations.  The LUU-2C/B flare is 36 inches long, 4.9 inches in diameter and weighs approximately 29 pounds. It consists of four major components: the mechanical timer, the parachute suspension system, the Out-of Line Igniter (OLI) , and the case assembly with tamped candle. The timer consists of a mechanical timer and related hardware enclosed in a lexan plastic housing. The mechanical timer is a verge type, three-gear timer, powered by a torsional mainspring.  A phosphorescent plas tic decal with calibrated markings to indicate the feet-of-fall prior to parachute deployment and flare functioning is located on the face of the timer cover.  The decal has a “SAFE” position and timer settings from 250 to 11,000 feet-of-fall.  Under the p ointer portion of the timer knob, and as part of the knob, a flexible arm is located with a detent that will retain the knob in the recess next to the corresponding timer setting.  The timer knob has a quick attach-detach spring operated latch which allows  the lanyard loop to be connected to the knob.  A pawl release mechanism retains the timer assembly in the flare housing.  A mechanical destruct feature makes the timer inoperative after it is functioned. The parachute suspension system utilizes an 18-foot  diameter cruciform shaped canopy for stability. Two riser cables connect the parachute to a bulkhead separating the parachute compartment from the remainder of the flare assembly.  One cable is attached to an explosive bolt for parachute dump at candle bu rnout. The ignition system utilizes a lanyard that is attached to one of the parachute riser cables. The lanyard is threaded through the bulkhead and past the candle in an internal raceway along the side of the aluminum case leading to the ignition assembl y in the ignition housing near the candle’s face. The lanyard is attached to a triggering mechanism consisting of the Out-of-Line Igniter (OLI). The pyrotechnic firing train consists of a percussion primer, boron-potassium nitrate pellets, and a propellant  wafer. The illuminating candle is a tamp cast composition consisting of magnesium (61%), sodium nitrate (30.9%), and polymer binder (8.1%). The candle is approximately 20 inches long and weighs approximately 20.5 pounds. Please note that the igniter is a Thiokol proprietary part.

<CONTACT>Robert Massaro, 732-532-2677
<DESC>NA This notice attempts to identify additional sources for a future competitively-solicited, firm-fixed price, IDIQ contract in support of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS). A best-value, competitive acquisition is planned. The a warded contract will be a one-year, IDIQ type contract with four one-year options. The contract will also include a two-year Award Term Incentive that will allow the Government to extend the period of performance from five to seven years with the award of any future requirements subject to the availability of funds.  The contractor shall provide Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) SINCGARS, associated ancillary equipment, spares for various legacy configurations, test sets, repair, engineering servic es, and an exportable version of the ASIP radio. Spares are defined as Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs), replaceable subassemblies, and parts of end items that have National Stock Number (NSN) assignments and are listed on Appen dix A of the Statement of Work (SOW). Support services include repair, repair and return, and other engineering/technical services that are needed to field and sustain SINCGARS equipment. Please Note: the SOW and the associated NSN assignments listed on Ap pendix A of the SOW may be found on the Army's Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at:  https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. Select CECOM Comm. Elec. Comm; Select Solicitation Number: DAAB07-03-R-C205. All the essential information and documents rela ted to this solicitation may be found on the IBOP. CECOM is revising the SOW, and the following are the areas that will be changed. These changes shall NOT BE SEPARATELY PRICED, and therefore are built into the unit price of each of the NSNs on contract. 1.  OBSOLESCENCE MANAGEMENT: Obsolescence will be transparent to CECOM. The effect of obsolescence and/or obsolescence issues will be the responsibililty of the contractor to control. The contractor shall be responsible for planning for obsolescence; initi ating minimum buys of parts, buyouts, requalifications of part substitutes, and any necessary redesigns, while maintaining the contracted delivery schedule and firm-fixed price of each item. During any redesign effort, modernization should be pursued to im prove performance and schedule, and reduce the Government's Total Ownership Cost. Several of CECOM's goals are (but not limited to): improvement in the reliability repairs, reduction in the number of components and spares, increase in the use of commonly a vailable commercial parts, and reduction in Production Lead Time. Any new designs shall be qualified, at a minimum, at the system level for compatibility with all equipment (including TMDE), and all configurations already fielded, and shall be the responsi bility of the contractor to ensure this hardware and software compatibility. The form, fit, and function of the equipment will be maintained. 2.  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT: CECOM intends to release the configuration control of the SINCGARS technical data to the contractor. With the exception of INFOSEC related items, the contractor shall be responsible for all the changes and updates to the drawi ngs without requiring CECOM's approval. A CECOM representative, such as a QAR, COR, or other member deemed necessary, shall be provided copies of the approved internal Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) (or contractor change document) and updated (revised ) drawings as they are entered into the contractor's own drawing repository. At any time during the contract period, the technical baseline at the contractor's facility shall be the same as at CECOM's. The drawings provided at the time of award will serve as the initial technical baseline, or the starting point. The Government will provide drawing numbers for your configuration control. Updates to the Technical Data Package (TDP) will not have any proprietary designs introduced so that the TDP will remain c ompetitive. 3.  AWARD TERM INCENTIVE: A two-year award term incentive will be added to the contract. The basis of award for this term will be the performance of the contractor with regard to reliability improvements and power consumption improvement during the initial  five-year period of the contract. The contractor shall propose a Reliability Improvement Curve and Power Consumption Improvement Curve depicting their anticipated improvements that initially will serve as evaluation criteria. These curves shall then becom e a contractual obligation, and added to the base contract of the winning offeror. Meeting or exceeding the stated objectives of these two curves will form the basis for awarding the two-year contract term. These revisions are provided for the offeror's information and are subject to change. Feedback is welcomed by April 11, 2003. The final solicitation is expected to be released by mid May 2003 with an anticipated award date of November 2003. In the event that your firm has an interest in bidding this proposed solicitation, request that your response be forwarded to the lead Contra ct Specialist, Robert A. Massaro at (732) 532-2766. Your response should include at a minimum your company name, address, cage code, and a technical point of contact.

<DESC>Description
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize applicable electric, water and wastewater infrastructure at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.  A brief description and approximate size of each system is detailed as follows:  

Fort Buchanan Electrical System:  

Ft. Buchanan owns its electrical distribution system. The Puerto Rico Power Authority (PREPA) supplies power from the Puerto Nuevo Steam Plant.  PREPA’s 38 KV transmission line, which normally feeds the base, is designated as line # 3900.  The base can also be fed by PREPA’s main transmission grid through the Caparra substation. Caparra is a 38 KV to 4160- volt substation, with designated lines # 3500 and # 4300 as well as # 3900 feeding into it. Fort Buchanan has one main substation.  There are two (2), three phase transformers; one rated 10 MVA and the other 7.5 MVA, at 38KV/ 13.2 KV but with the addition of forced air can be increased to 12.5 and 10 MVA respectively.  The transformers contain no known PCBs.  The electrical primary grid is composed of three (3), 13.2 kV three phase feeder lines that provide primary distribution to the post from the main substation. The main substation has a total capacity of 22.5 MVA, however when redundancy is considered, the capacity is reduced to 12.5 MVA. The electrical distribution system is primarily overhead, supported on wood and concrete poles, however there is some underground primary and secondary distribution, primarily for the housing area and for street lighting. 

The overhead pole-line is conventional open wire grid with a length of 82,400 lineal feet, (15.6 miles).  The existing system uses pole-mounted transformers and the majority is 20 + years old. A small portion of underground primary construction utilizes duct type construction and pad-mounted transformers.  The underground system was repaired/upgraded in September 2001.  The underground systems in four family housing areas are partially completed and are not yet energized. 
 
Fort Buchanan Water Supply System:  

Ft. Buchanan owns its water distribution system, which is approximately 50 years old.  It is comprised of about 25 miles of potable water lines, which supplies the post’s facilities and housing areas.   It consists of a domestic water supply, storage, and distribution system made of cast iron, asbestos cement, galvanized iron, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) lines, ranging in size from 2 inches to 30 inches.   Fort Buchanan does not maintain a separate non-potable water system for fire protection purposes.  The base has three intakes lines from the system of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). The intake line is a 10-inch cast iron pipe, connected to a 30-inch main supply line installed in a marginal street. This 10-inch line is directed to a booster pump followed by meter to improve the pressure of the water coming from the mains. Another intake line consists of a 6-inch line connected to a 4-inch meter.  The Cataño intake consist of a 10 inch water pipe connected to PRASA’s   66 inch water line that runs along a right of way east to west across the center of Fort Buchanan.  Two 55 + years old storage tanks supply the maximum day and peak hour demands; one is a 500,000 gallon elevated concrete tank on the north side of the Post and the other is a 1,000,000-gallon ground concrete tank.  Both tanks are in good operating condition.

Fort Buchanan Wastewater Collection System:  

Fort Buchanan’s sanitary sewer collection system consists of over 14 miles of 4 to 24 inch diameter sewer lines.  The majority of lines are 50 + year old.   There is a 500 GPM lift station and force line on the Golf Club sub-basin area.  System line material includes vitrified clay; reinforce concrete, cast iron, and concrete. Insituform Company restored all the lines in 1994 by installing custom-manufactured polyester-fiber tubing that forms a seamless, joint less, leak proof "pipe within a pipe". Wastewater is collected from throughout the reservation by the existing sewage system and discharged into the PRASA owned Bayamon 42-inch Trunk Sewer. The trunk sewer traverses the northern half of the post in a west-to-east direction ultimately discharging into a PRASA owned sewage treatment facility off post.  Fort Buchanan owns the wastewater system with the exception of the main 42-inch trunk line and the 18-24 inch Tintillo line.

Flowing through the post in a south-to-north direction and paralleling El Toro Creek for most of its length, is the 18-24 inch PRASA sewer; this line only receives sewage flow from the Post at isolated points but primarily serves the Tintillo Development and other areas south of the Fort Buchanan perimeter.  
 
The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the Request For Proposal (RFP).  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  Companies having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought notice including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Mily Le, Mily.Le@dla.mil no later than April 21, 2003.  Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size and status such as disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and/or major subcontractor or (prime); and what utility systems you are interested in.  Please direct any questions or concerns to the Contract Specialist for this action:  LTC Mike Hummel, Michael.L.Hummel@dla.mil.

<DESC>This RFQ cancels previous RFQ DTMA1Q03003 and Offerors who submitted under RFQ DTMA1Q030003 must resubmit a proposal for consideration.  The Maritime Administration is seeking consultant services to perform a detailed study regarding Comparison of Tax Regimes Affecting Vessels and Mariners in International Trade.  The objectives of the study are as follows: (1)  Tax analysis by a consultant with accountancy expertise and experience in assessing the differences in flag-state tax treatment of the 13 to 20, most popular merchant vessel registries and two or more, recently established or revised, European tonnage tax alternatives to corporate income taxes, listed under Scope of Work. (2) Creation of three matrix charts of suitable size and design for public presentation, to be used to compare vessel and citizen-mariner tax treatment under the U.S. flag relative to treatment under the foreign flags described under Scope of Work. (3) Development of a short written report that contrasts major differences in registry tax treatment on vessels and citizen mariners in international trade and summarizes U.S. tax policies that may serve as disincentives to ship-owners to place vessels in the U.S. register.   All offerors who possess the knowledge and are capable of performing the described work are encouraged to submit capabilities statements and price quotations at the designated address by 2:00 p.m. eastern time, Tuesday, April 8, 2003 to Krista N. French, Contract Specialist.  The statement of work is available upon written request to Krista.French@marad.dot.gov.    The Government anticipates the cost of this study to be in the range of $20,000 to $40,000.  A purchase order will be awarded to the offeror who is determined to be responsible and who’s cost proposal and technical capabilities represent the best value to the government.

<DESC>This synopsis advertises the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's potential need for high data rate, fully programmable space data receivers/demodulators and test modulators for its command and data acquisition (CDA) stations in Fairbanks, AK and Wallops, VA.  THEREFORE, this advertisement is to conduct market research to identify whether a commercial item can fulfill this mission, and define the approach for acquiring any such FULLY PROGRAMMABLE HIGH DATA RATE systems.  These systems are believed to be commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELEASE ANY SOLICITATION.  This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202.  The intent of this survey and request for information is to describe the required features, as these features correspond to the mission need to accommodate multiple missions without the need for equipment customization, delays due to equipment integration, preliminary in-plant programming, or other modifications.  It is anticipated that the commercial market can supply a fully programmable receiver/demodulator that covers multiple data rates including rates in the range of 1 Mbps to 400 Mbps for QPSK, 200 for BPSK, as well as multiple modulation types.  The process of this survey request is described in FAR subpart 11.002. The Government intends to use streamlined procedures if a solicitation follows from the results of this survey.  The intent of this notice also includes identifying any appropriate commercial practices.  NOAA intends, in any subsequent solicitation, to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, which may include the following: indefinite quantity & indefinite delivery ordering; performance and quantity options; financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; and Government-required inspection and acceptance procedures-if applicable to commercial practices.  Optional quantities above the priced value within the scope of this contract's ordering authority are also anticipated.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U. S. Department of Commerce, is conducting a market survey and commercial item acquisition to procure a high data rate, fully programmable (also referred to as "selectable"), space data ground terminal application.  The items being procured are a Receiver/Demodulator and a Transmitter Test Simulator.  Other requirements include a training option, licensing, warranty, and an extended warranty option.  The specific characteristics follow.  All specifications are mandatory unless otherwise noted.  Receiver/Demodulator Data Rate: Selectable via software control up to approximately 400Mbps for QPSK, 200 for BPSK.  Frequency Options (Selectable via software control): Support an Intermediate Frequency (IF) input of 720 MHz +/-400 kHz or 1,200 MHz +/-1 MHz and/or tunable S-band between 2100 and 2500 MHz in 25-kHz steps maximum.  An optional tuning range between 1660 MHz and 3220 MHz is desirable but not mandatory.  The input impedance shall be 50 ohms with VSWR of 2:1 maximum.  Phase noise must equal or exceed:  -70 dBc @ 10 kHz, -100 dBc @ 100 kHz, and -120 dBc @ 1 MHz.  Selectable Modulation types: BSPK, QPSK, SQPSK (OQPSK), UQPSK, 8PSK, (SQPN desirable but not required).  The digital output shall be differential Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL).  Differential Decoding: Selectable NRZ-M/S to NRZ-L.  BER performance based on data rate (compared to theory): <150 Mbps: =<1 dB, 150-400 Mbps: =<2 dB, >400Mbps: =<3 dB down to Eb/No of 6.4 dB.  Bit synchronizer data rate variation:  within 0.1% up to 150 Mbps, 0.01% above 150 Mbps.  Provide quality of service statistics (packets delivered, BER, etc.) as output data to control PC workstation upon request.  Supported de-coding (selectable via software control): Viterbi with constraint length K=7, rate = 1/3, 1/2, 3/4, or none.  Desirable MTBF: 20,000 or more HOURS.  Support remote command and control via a TCP/IP interface and API.  Warranty of one-year parts and labor is DESIRED.  Request separately priced extended warranty covering software and hardware (priced in annual increments (1 or more years, up to 5 years), with a time and materials option to perform on-site (Fairbanks CDA site) service/repair. Transmitter/Test Simulator requirements: Compatible with the receiver/demodulator specified above.  Can support end-to-end RF and test data set injection at 720 MHz or 1,200 MHz IF and/or S-Band.  RF test: Modulations, data rates and encoding as specified for the receiver above.  Data injection test: ability to inject test signals and modulated test signals into serial bit data stream to perform end-to-end system diagnostics and performance verification.  It is desirable that the test modulator simulate Doppler for a low earth orbiting satellite.  It shall also support a remote command and control via secure TCP/IP interface, and the API must be provided.  .  The Government intends to use its Contractor, Harris Technical Services Corp., Bellevue, NE, and The Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, CA, as its support contractors to assist it in evaluating the merits of each feature, if a solicitation results.  We anticipate setting up a test and demonstration period lasting approximately 30 days to first bench test all compliant units, and then field test the units at NOAA's satellite command and data acquisition station in Fairbanks, AK.  The tests will be rigorously and uniformly applied to each capable unit, and the results will be used as the primary weight of determination of mission technical suitability.  The Market Survey responses are due at the location specified below (five paper copies and one electronic copy) by April 14, 2003. A technical compliance matrix and past performance references are highly sought to help the Government make its determination whether to undertake a competition for a bona fide requirement.  Respondents are also requested to provide budgetary costs of the unit(s) in quantities of 1, 4, 7, and 10.  Respondents are cautioned to designate those sections that are business proprietary and subject to exclusion from release under a FOIA exemption. IMPORTANT!!

<RESPDATE>070103
<CONTACT>John Miller, (850) 235-5399
<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (CSS) is interested in receiving information on emerging Chemical/Biological Individual Protection technologies (CBIP). This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought will serve as a first step for evaluating research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2004-2007. Only approaches requiring research and development will be considered. This RFI/Sources Sought addresses two major thrust areas: Clothing The goal of the clothing thrust is to provide the user unlimited percutaneous protection against CB agents, radiological particles, and toxic industrial materials (TIMS) while reducing the physiological stress, logistical burden, and equipment compatibility problems normally associated with wearing protective equipment.  Clothing technology will mainly focus on the development o f materials and the supporting technologies required to transition those materials into a clothing program.  The following Joint Service Programs are relevant to this thrust area: ·	Joint Chemical Ensemble (JCE): The JCE will provide improvements over the Joint Service Lightweight Suit Technology (JSLIST).  Primary advances will be sought in reduced thermal stress, garment weight, scope of protection, and self-decontamination. ·	Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Suit (JSCESS): The JSCESS is a disposable/limited use protective suit for special applications.  It is an increasing priority for Special Forces.  The suit will provide protection for escape and short duration missions.  Material advances are required to provide required protection with minimum suit weight and volume. ·	Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE):  The JPACE is intended to become the p rimary protective ensemble for all aircrew.  The program addresses the need to provide complete percutaneous protection against CB agents, TIMS, and radiological particles.  The program is in a pre-procurement stage.  Technological improvements identified will probably be implemented in future acquisitions. ·	Joint Service Lightweight Suit Technology (JSLIST): The JSLIST, currently in the fielding process, will be the primary percutaneous protection for all ground forces and shipboard personnel.  Improvements are sought in aerosol protection, TIMs protection, and thermal load.  Improvements will be implemented in future acquisitions. Within the Clothing thrust area solutions are sought that are of a revolutionary nature (high risk/high pay-off) and not evolutionary in nature. Areas of potential interest include: ·	Novel permeable or semi-permeable technologies that reduc e heat stress on the warfighter, but prevent the penetration of aerosols through clothing materials. (not based on membrane, nanofiber, or microfiber technologies) ·	Novel closure technologies for protective clothing.  This may include seaming, zippers, and other closures. ·	Unique materials that reduce the weight and cube (volume) of protective clothing.  Disposable or reduced durability materials may be considered for special applications. ·	Technologies that can indicate remaining service life of the garment (uncontaminated by CB).  Approaches may include both active (powered) and passive technologies. Masks The goal of the mask thrust is to provide the user unlimited respiratory protection against CB agents, radiological particles, and TIMS while reducing the physiological stress, logistical burden, and equipment compatibility problems normally associated with we aring protective equipment.  This thrust area will focus primarily on air purification technologies, materials technologies for mask lens and facepieces, and supporting technologies required to transition those technologies into a mask program. The following Joint Service Programs are relevant to this thrust area: ·	Next Generation General Purpose Mask (NGGPM): The NGGPM is the primary focus of the Mask Thrust Area.  It will provide enhanced performance over the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) in the areas of reduced respiratory and thermal stress, enhanced protection, improved comfort, improved interoperability with equipment, etc.  ·	Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM): The JSGPM is intended to become the primary respiratory protection for all ground forces and shipboard personnel.  The program addresses the need to provide complete respiratory protectio n against CB agents, TIMS, and radiological particles.  An example of a potentially acceptable technology is improved adsorbents for TIMS filtration. ·	Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask (JSCESM): To meet the needs of the special operations forces and other unique mission requirements, the JSCESM is intended to provide a disposable, one-size-fits-all mask.  The mask should provide respiratory protection in contaminated environments for short duration (less than 6 hours) exposures.  Advances will be sought in weight and volume of the mask and its components while maintaining an adequate level of protection. ·	End-of-Service-Life-Indicator (ESLI) for mask filters. Within the Mask thrust area solutions are sought that are of a revolutionary nature (high risk/high pay-off) and not evolutionary in nature. Areas of potential interest include: ·	Non-sorbent  based technologies for removing chemical agent vapor from air for application in individual respirators (masks) ·	Novel technologies for removing biological agents and chemical agent aerosols from air for application in individual respirators (not be based on HEPA or electret technology)  ·	Approaches for reducing the thermal stress imposed on the warfighter by the mask ·	Advanced technologies that increase the scope of protection provided against and TIMS.  ·	Self-decontaminating materials for masks ·	Concepts to identify when the seal between the mask and the face is broken Interested parties must provide written submittals, to be received by the Government by COB on 01 July 2003.  The Government will assess submittals by 17 Oct 2003 for their potential to address CBIP development issues.  Contractors’ submittals that are determined by the evaluation team as possessin g the potential for contributing to CBIP development may be provided the opportunity to present/demonstrate their work at some point in the future.  Contractors may submit a paper for either of the two thrust areas identified above, or both.   There is no specific format or outline that submittals must follow.  However, information pertinent to the area of interest, especially technical maturity and capability, must be provided.  Include other descriptive literature and any other specific or pertinent information that would enhance consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Proprietary material must be clearly marked at the top and bottom of each page. Offerors responding must also indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), 8(a), or large business (L).  Please include four (4) copies of each response.  Each response  must reference the RFI title, which thrust area is being addressed, and must be limited in length to ten (10) typed pages.  Specific narrative information that should be provided with the submission includes: (1) Description and capabilities, (2) Chronology of system development, and (3) Summary of past test or evaluation events with location, dates, and results. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract. If any procurements are developed as a result of this announcement, they shall be advertised in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.

<CONTACT>Stephanie Hawk, Buyer, Phone 301-827-7886, Fax 301-594-2127, Email hawks@cder.fda.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D87951.  These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 7389 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order for the following project. The contractor will catalog the clinical immune effects of selected drugs, including any indication of allergenicity and increased incidence of infections, and collect parametric data from nonclinical studies that might indicate adverse immune effects from the selected drugs.  Nonclinical parameters that will be analyzed include increased incidence of infections, routine hematology, routine clinical chemistry (e.g. changes in total protein levels and composition), body weight and weight and histology of all lymphoid tissues (e.g. bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus), gross necropsy evaluations and histopathology of lymphoid organs, and carcinogenicity.  For each selected drug, the contractor will collect data that will be used to evaluate the potential of the selected nonclincial parameters to predict adverse clinical immune effects.  The type of analysis will depend upon the quality of the data obtained and it may or may not include generating correlation coefficients between nonclinical parameters and clinical immunotoxic effects.  The contractor will also aid in the preparation of the data for presentation to CDER and its stakeholders.  The principal investigator and co-investigators will advise and assist the contractor in all aspects of the project.  A learning curve is expected and the expected time frame for the first couple of drug is 3 to 4 weeks per drug.  After that it is expected that each drug will take approximately two weeks to complete.  The final month will be used to compile data into a final report, write a draft paper and potentially design a poster for the FDA Science Forum.  The contractor will have to work on-site in space provided by the FDA.  Period of Performance: One year from date of award or 2000 hours from date of award.  Requirements:  The contractor should have an interest in immunology and drug development.  Minimum requirements include a BS with a minimum of 30 credit hours of science, of which at least 15 hours must be in a relevant biological field.  Preference will be given to candidates with graduate training in immunology, pathology and/or histology.  Should also have good computer and organizational skills.  The contractor shall obtain FDA security clearance prior to  beginning work and sign a confidentiality agreement as well.  Please include a Curriculum Vitae in your application.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.  The award will be issued to the contractor offering the best value to the government.  FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will sponsor its Fourth Annual Small Business Conference on May 12-15, 2003, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the Albuquerque Convention Center. This year's conference theme Securing Economic Freedom-Empowering Small Business reflects DOE'S response to the President's Agenda on Small Business as well as DOE'S commitment to small businesses. The conference plays a major role in providing procurement guidance and contracting opportunities to small business. The conference will bring together representatives of the Department, its prime contractors, our network of National Laboratories, and several other Federal agencies to provide valuable information about business lines and upcoming contracting opportunities at DOE and at other agencies as well. The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, and HUBZone small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE has exciting opportunities to offer small businesses in the areas of commodities, administrative services, science, security, and environmental quality and energy resources.  It is important that business leaders, advocates, and DOE program representatives celebrate the achievements of DOE small business partners, as well as build new and stronger alliances between the small business community and DOE laboratories. DOE has received positive reviews on the previous three conferences, as well as recommendations from the small business community. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department and will also incorporate some of the significant recommendations received from prior years.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.   For more information or to register, please visit the conference website at http://www.smallbusiness-outreach.doe.gov/ .  DOE looks forward to your participation.

<SUBJECT>99--IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL DFRC VENDORS
<DESC>NASA is implementing an agency-wide software program, known as Integrated Financial Management (IFM), to modernize its financial systems and processes.	NASA DFRC is scheduled to shutdown our existing financial systems in May 2003 and begin using the Core Financial module of IFM by the end of June. Our records indicate your firm has an active contract or purchase order with NASA DFRC and consequently may be impacted.  To facilitate the cutover process, we need your assistance in several areas.   1.   INVOICES. The Center’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer for Finance has determined that it is prudent to waive the thirty-day waiting period for payments under the Prompt Payment Act prior to closing the legacy financial system.  Invoices received between April 16 and May 1, 2003 will not be subject to the Prompt Payment Act waiting period and will be paid early.  During the cutover period (May 17 through the end of June), NASA DFRC will be unable to make payments except for emergencies.  Therefore, we are encouraging contractors, where possible, to submit invoices to the address specified on the Purchase order or Contract no later than May 1, 2003.  NASA DFRC Financial Management Office will make every effort to have these invoices approved by May 7, 2003, in order for them to be paid prior to shutdown of our legacy financial system.  Those invoices not received and approved by May 7, 2003, may not be paid until after NASA DFRC successfully implements Core Financial.  Please keep in mind that NASA DFRC cannot honor invoices requesting advance payment for goods and services to be received during this transition period.	The DFRC Financial Management and Procurement Offices will be working with you to maintain continuity of service since payment processing may be interrupted during our cutover window.  The Prompt Payment clause in your contract discusses the provisions for paying interest if payment is not received by its calculated due date.  Please consult the clause for applicability of interest penalty payments for your specific contract.  The interest penalty is paid automatically, without a request from the Contractor.  As part of our cutover planning, we are currently investigating our options for making emergency payments should the need arise.  As we get closer to our shut down, we will finalize these plans and provide additional information. 2.     COST REPORTS (533). We are attempting to assemble our contractor cost data early so that we can complete our May month-end closing by our established shutdown date.  If it is applicable to your contract you can assist us by submitting the Contractor Financial Management Reports (NASA Form 533M) for April no later than, but preferably before, Monday, May 5, 2003, if your report is not currently required before that date.  Although costs and hours reported should be based upon actual amounts incurred, we recognize that you may need to estimate some costs for the latter part of April.	If this is necessary, please ensure that the 533M for May identifies any adjustments made to the costs and hours reported for April. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience and support as we make this transition.  If you have any questions or require further details, please contact Valerie Zellmer at (661) 276-3604 or email her at valerie.j.zellmer@nasa.gov. Cordially, Valerie Zellmer Deputy Chief Financial Officer for Finance

<SUBJECT>R -- A-76 Express Review Study for Clerical Support Services
<DESC>Reference Solicitations NRCS-11-AZ-03 and NRCS-12-AZ-03.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), intends to conduct two separate cost comparisons in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures.  The studies are for two separate clerical support functions in Phoenix, Arizona.  The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for clerical support services. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in clerical support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer lorna.lincoln@az.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561110.  Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer.

MARMEM Statement of Work as of 21 March 03

Background:  

In the mid 1970's, unique software was written in order to calculate each NATO nation's maritime contribution of Battle Decisive ordnance of the Ministerial authorized Level of Effort.  Since its inception, the Maritime Munitions Expenditure Model (MARMEM) has undergone constant revision to reflect changes in Defence Planning and Stockpile Planning Policy.  The senior review board for the MARMEM is the Bi-SC Logistics Coordination Board (Bi-SC LCB) and the working level NATO body is the Bi-SC Stockpile Planning Working Group (Bi-SC SPWG.)  MARMEM is currently migrating to join similar air and land stockpile planning tools in a software suite know as the Allied Commands Resource Optimization Software Systems (ACROSS) which is itself a component of the NATO Logistics Functional Areas System (LOGFAS.)  NACOSA is assuming the configuration control and database management of MARMEM in accordance with NATO standards.   Even with NACOSA support, there remains significant and continuing model development, policy interpretation, analytical studies and decision support that must continue.  Up to four, week-long meetings a year are scheduled at which the contractor must have a comprehensive knowledge of MARMEM, any previous studies and be able to assess and model the impact or any current or proposed policy changes.

To ensure timely completion of all tasking during this period ACLANT is seeking a highly experienced independent consultant(s) to support MARMEM development, integration into ACROSS and LOGFAS, and provide scientific advice on the impact of any Defence Planning or Stockpile Planning policy change.

-	modifying MARMEM as necessary to correctly interface with the Sustainment Planning Model (SPM) development.

2.  Prepare for and Conduct a three-day Workshop for up to 25 participants, in Europe for representatives from Invited Countries to include;

-	prepare an orientation to the Bi-SC stockpile planning process, target oriented stockpile planning concepts, policy, procedures, and a model brief in order to provide a frame of reference for the participants;
-	prepare and installation disc and install MARMEM on the workshop computers; 
-	conduct and train participants on all the necessary steps in order to  calculate the final maritime requirements for the bi-annual Bi-SC Stockpile Planning Guidance (SPG);
-	provide an unclassified course summary to each participant.

3.  Conduct a MARMEM Data Experts Meeting (DEM) in Europe in preparation for SPG 2004.

-	prepare a briefing of the stockpile planning concepts in order to provide a frame of reference for the national operational experts and analysts;
-	prepare handouts for the participants in order to:
-	verify the definitions of generic platform class and threat category; verify the representative target class for each threat category;
-	present the last set of target allocation percentages; iterate on the allocation percentages until a consensus develops for each Planning Situation;
-	verify the operational definitions of a "kill;"
-	determine the need to include environmental effects in the current set of planning situations;
-	verify that the current measure of performance makes sense in the current Defence Requirements Review (DRR) Planning Situations and is an understandable policy;
-	inquire about the frequency of false targets and discuss using a rate v.s. ratio approach in modeling; and
-	write a report of technical issues arising from the DEM, the conclusions reached and reflect the consensus decisions in MARMEM.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term ?EFT? refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-- (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database. (f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-- (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-- (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government.
