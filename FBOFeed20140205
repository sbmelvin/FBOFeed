<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Irrigating Solutions will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of<strong> Disposable ECG Electrodes on or about December 1, 2012</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><strong>Examples of items being solicited may include but not limited to</strong>&nbsp;a complete product line of Disposable ECG Electrodes for all monitoring/diagnostic ECG applications to include: single use, latex-free/safe electrodes in various sizes and diameters, manufactured of foam/foam substrates and tape/vinyl substrates, snap and tab designs, with a variety of pre-gelled backings (wet-get, liquid gel, solid gel, conductive gel or sticky-gel) specifically designed to be applied directly to the patient's skin to acquire and transmit the electrical signal at the body surface to a processor that produces an electrocardiogram. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $1,400,672.85 annually.
<p>NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong><br />Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this multiple-year solicitation is to aerially apply mating disruptants to control low density populations of the gypsy moth in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota in the base year of 2014, and in option years 2015 and 2016 (if exercised). Disruptants registered with EPA and available for use are Disrupt II (EPA Reg. No.8730-55; Hercon Environmental, Emigsville, PA) and SPLAT-GM or SPLAT-GM Organic (EPA Reg. No. 80286-4 and 80286-12 respectively; ISCA Technologies, Riverside, CA). All three of the disruptants require custom application systems that must be designed, built and tested prior to submitting an offer. Offerors are required to provide all application aircraft, custom application systems, observation aircraft, personnel, licenses, equipment, materials, disruptant, transportation and incidentals to support annual projects of several hundred thousand acres of treatment. Automated Flight Following (AFF) and Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) for aircraft tracking, guidance and flight path recording during spray operations is also required of all awardees. Treatment blocks will be a mixture of contiguous forested areas, urban or residential areas and agricultural areas dotted with homes and small woodlots. Treatments will occur primarily in June, July and early August of each year.
<p>This project is offered as a Firm Fixed Price solicitation with Option Years. The total acreage and locations of the treatment blocks that make up the 2014 projects are provided in the solicitation. The work is offered in two items - one item includes approximately 60% of the work and the other approximately 40% of the work. Work in the Option years (if exercised) will remain about the same as far as total acreage that requires treatment and the division of work between items. However the specific geographic location and size of each individual treatment block will vary in the Option Years when compared to 2014.</p>
<p>This project has been entirely set aside for small business and will be awarded based upon a combination of both technical and cost factors. Multiple awards are possible. For more information, please contact Richard O'Neill 414-297-1128 or Ann Ball 414-297-1834. The solicitation AG-56A1-S-14-0002 is tentatively scheduled to be posted in FBO February 19, 2014.</p>

<DESC>This presolicitation notice provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate and award on a sole source basis a contract for the continuation of Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Support Services while the contract award is under litigation. The contract will be issued on a sole source basis to PAE Applied Technologies, LLC, (PAE) 6500 West Freeway, Ste 600, Fort Worth, TX 76116-2118 for the continuance of uninterrupted technical and engineering services to support the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Department until the period of performance begins on the follow on contract, once litigation has been concluded. This contract will cover up to an additional six months of support. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under the contract, and the need to continue these services, PAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services until award of the competitive follow-on contract is finalized. PAE is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an impact on the fielded systems, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in services. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the start of the follow-on contract. As a result, this short term bridge contract will be procured on a sole source basis. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Any questions pertaining to this announcement shall be submitted to John Bohner, Code 2.5.1.11.4 via email john.bohner@navy.mil.

<p>Competition is not feasible due the fact that the equipment is located in Sprint-owned facilities. No other source has access to the equipment or the engineering data required to operate and maintain the equipment in order to continue service to Government users. Sprint has control and access to the fiber and equipment infrastructure and can provide the services required. Sprint, as the fiber owner, has the right to provide the required services because the fibers in the bundles can only be accessed by the commercial fiber owner. Thus, there is only one source capable to perform this effort and provide the Government the essential services required. <br /><br />(16) Description<br /><br />The U.S. Government has a requirement for the operation and maintenance of dark fiber pairs over approximately 6,568.5 miles within Europe to support Department of Defense (DOD) communications Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS). The period of performance is a base performance period of one (1) year and nine one-year options, for a total of ten (10) years if all options are exercised. The requirement is to provide continued operations and maintenance in order to provide continuity of services of the U.S. Government-owned Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN). The Contractor shall provide dark fiber and commercial facilities to support the requirement and will provide optical and electrical equipment to upgrade the fiber assets in Contractor facilities and other Government locations. The Contractor's facility and its personnel must maintain a minimum Security Clearance at the Secret level. Other performance and security requirements apply.<br /><br />(17) Place of Contract Performance - United States and Europe<br /><br />(18) Set-aside Status - None.<br /><br />(19) Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within thirty days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

RFID makes it possible to seamlessly track every prescription throughout the filling and storage process, reducing inventory control time to seconds and significantly increasing the efficiency of central fill operations. Using RFID technology, prescriptions arriving from central fill operations can be validated in seconds, eliminating the bottleneck created by central fill deliveries that can take 2 to 3 hours to confirm every day. Each GWIS drawer uses GSL's IntelliSys  RFID technology to constantly interrogate the SmartBaskets  containing individual prescriptions. IntelliCab, together with GSL's IntelliPads , makes tracking a prescription nearly continuous and automatic. <br> 27&aquot;L.   35.5&aquot;W.   74.5&aquot;H.    650lbs

However, the government lacks a fully robust technical data package, nor owns sufficient government purpose rights to organically sustain the hardware and software of the current JTE baseline. The system has become increasingly difficult to maintain when factoring in the existence of proprietary software and various hardware components that have become obsolete. To alleviate these sustainment issues the Air Force awarded the Joint Threat Emitter Follow-on Production (JTEFOP) contract to Northrop Grumman Amhearst Systems (NGAS) in a competitive source selection process. The JTEFOP will provide the government full Government Purpose Rights, a complete Technical Data Package, eliminate the proprietary software, resolve system obsolescence, purchase 5-15 additional JTEs, manufacture up to 18 JTE retrofit kits, and provide Provisioning Data, initial spares, and JTE system training. This contract also supports Foreign Military requirements for JTE systems, training, and spares. The JTEFOP has an extensive first article testing requirement to ensure the robustness of the upgraded design as well as the verification of the backwards compatibility requirement with the 18 currently fielded JTE systems. <br /></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511. The Government will use this information to determine if there are interested and qualified vendors to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hub zone, and Woman-Owned small business concerns. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast">The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">2. Background and Program Details<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><br />As it currently stands, there are 18 fielded JTE systems. However, the government lacks a fully robust technical data package, nor owns sufficient government purpose rights to organically sustain the hardware and software of the current JTE baseline. The system has become increasingly difficult to maintain when factoring in the existence of proprietary software and various hardware components that have become obsolete. To alleviate these sustainment issues the Air Force awarded the Joint Threat Emitter Follow-on Production (JTEFOP) contract to Northrop Grumman Amhearst Systems (NGAS) in a competitive source selection process. The JTEFOP will provide the government full Government Purpose Rights, a complete Technical Data Package, eliminate the proprietary software, resolve system obsolescence, purchase 5-15 additional JTEs, manufacture up to 18 JTE retrofit kits, and provide Provisioning Data, initial spares, and JTE system training. This contract also supports Foreign Military requirements for JTE systems, training, and spares. The JTEFOP has an extensive first article testing requirement to ensure the robustness of the upgraded design as well as the verification of the backwards compatibility requirement with the 18 currently fielded JTE systems. <br /></span></p>

<a href="mailto:steven.t.helm.mil@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify interested sources for Shaped Demolition Charges.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, to determine interest in a planned Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 procurement for the 15 lb and 40 lb Shaped Charges.  The U.S. Government (USG) anticipates a total contract length of 3-5 years.  <br>  <br> Item Description: <br>  <br> Shaped Demolition Charge's primary use is for boring holes in earth, metal, masonry, concrete, and paved and unpaved roads.  When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted to a compressed gas.  The gas exerts pressure in the form of a shockwave.  The main charge converts the shaped liner into a high speed jet charge, which penetrates the target. The M2A4, 15 lb Shaped Charge penetrates reinforced concrete to a depth of about 3 feet, with the diameter of a hole tapering from about 2.75 in at the mouth. The M3A1, 40 lb Shaped Charge penetrates reinforced concrete to a depth of about 5 feet, with the diameter of a hole tapering from 3.5 inches at the mouth. <br>  <br> M2A4, 15 lb Shaped Demolition Charge (NSN: 1375-01-023-7994)  <br> The M2A1 consists of 10 lb minimum Composition B, which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 48 gram Composition A-3 booster charge.  The explosive charge is enclosed in a molded fiberglass container with a glass cone liner and a tin plated steel closing cap. The shaped charge assembly also has a carrying strap made of cotton webbing and a detachable molded fiberglass 6 inches standoff. Each charge with the standoff is packed in a fiberboard box with foam cushions. Then the fiberboard box is put in a barrier bag.  4 charges are packed in a wooden box per drawing 9281170.  <br>  <br> M3A1, 40 lb Shaped Demolition Charge (NSN: 1375-00-088-6691)  <br> The M3A1 consists of approximately 30.5   1.5 pounds of Composition B, which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 48 gram Composition A-3 booster charge. The explosive charge is enclosed in a seam welded or drawn sheet steel container along with a formed 10 quote mark  diameter steel conical shaped charge liner.  The liner is assembled using a crimp in conjunction with an adhesive/sealant.  Brackets for which to affix the cotton webbing carrying strap are spot welded to the container.  A drawn brass detonator well is soldered to a tin-coated steel closing cap which is press fit into the container after loading. The shaped charge assembly includes a detachable welded three-legged steel stand.  Finished assemblies are covered in a barrier material and packed in wooden boxes per drawing 7549165.   <br>  <br> The Composition B and A-3 will be provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM). The USG is currently conducting Insensitive Munitions (IM) programs for these items. The IM explosives (IMX-104 main fill and PAX 46 booster) may be implemented into production during this planned contract; completion of the IM qualification efforts for the 40 lb shaped charged is scheduled in December 2015 and for the 15 lb shaped charge is scheduled in April 2019.  The USG has not yet determined whether the IM explosives would be provided as GFM.   <br>  <br> The manufacture of these shape charges requires special skills and facilities. Melt pour loading of high explosives is a critical technology.  Critical skills include laboratory personnel, explosive operators, quality assurance, environmental, and research and development. Critical facilities include temperature controlled cooling bays, melt pour systems, real time x-rays/x-ray technicians. X-rays are important to determine whether the melt-pour casting contains cracks, voids, porosity, or separation.  Defects can cause malfunctioning of the charge.  <br>  <br> The Contractor will be required to successfully conduct First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on these items.  The shaped charges are procured to USG Technical Data Packages (TDP).  The entire USG TDPs will not be provided in support of this market research; however top-level drawings and packaging drawings identified below are available for interested sources to review.  The drawings are Distribution Statement A, which means distribution is authorized for public release; distribution is unlimited.  Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level and packaging drawings must submit a written request to the POC identified below.  <br>  <br> Drawings to be provided: <br> Item			Top Drawing			Packaging Drawing <br> M2A4			8861565			 9281170 <br> M3A1			8858390			 7549165 <br>  <br> It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal would solicit for the following anticipated requirements, with a resultant Contract award for USG FY 15 requirements as a base quantity, and options included for USG FYs 16-19 anticipated and possible unplanned requirements.  USG currently anticipated requirements for USG FYs 15-19 are as follows by each: <br>  <br>  FY		40 lb shaped charge		15lb shaped charge <br> USG FY15:  	2,412 					116  <br>  <br> USG FY16:  	2,840 					115 <br>  <br> USG FY17:  	2,734 					0 <br>  <br> USG FY18:  	2,638 					109 <br>  <br> USG FY19:  	2,643 					107 <br>  <br> Responses: <br> Interested companies are invited to indicate their interest by providing the USG the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past relevant manufacturing experience).  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (facilities, technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, then they must be able to demonstrate their ability to obtain those resources without significant delay.  Any potential key subcontractors should also be addressed, by indicating which key components or processes would be subcontracted and providing a brief summary of potential key component and/or process subcontractors.  Industry respondents are also invited to indicate to the Government whether the shape charge requirements can be met by available commercial or non-developmental items.

<DESC>This announcement is to all Small Business, 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Women-Owned Small Business concerns that may be interested in performing a contract for the Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation.  The work to be performed is described below.  Based upon response to this announcement, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside or proceed with an unrestricted solicitation.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard is $33.5M.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.
Work is located at Trinity Dam approximately 8 miles north of Lewiston, California, in Trinity County.
All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by e-mail to edanger@usbr.gov  not later than close of business on 02/14/2014.  The information provided in this announcement is all information the Government has available at this time.  There are no specifications, drawings, bid packages, or source lists available.
System for Award Management (SAM) applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov    

PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF WORK: The Trinity Dam Intake Mechanical Equipment Refurbishing Gate Shaft Refurbishing (Phase 1) procurement is a heavy civil construction project and requires the installation of mechanical equipment.  This project consists of removal of calcium carbonate (Calcite) from a valve Chamber, portions of gate shaft, and gate slots; installation of pipe supports for 24-inch air inlet and 20-inch floatwell pipes; and designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system.  
The valve Chamber is located in the heart of the dam and  access from below through a 1,242 foot long access tunnel, then by climbing two non-standard flights of ladders (aka Ship Ladders) in the access shaft, then traveling down an approximately 100 foot long tunnel, and passing a 42 inch diameter water tight portal.   The valve chamber can also be accessed from above via a 375 foot high gate shaft.  
The Government assumes that small businesses may choose to operate under some type of teaming arrangement. **Please note** Joint ventures can be made up of multiple small businesses and still be considered a small business under the exception to affiliation rule, provided they are not affiliated in ways other than in the proposed joint venture relationship for this procurement. The Offeror and Teaming Partners will require strong construction management, construction experience, safety experience, and capabilities in high work and non-permit required confined space operations.  The project's complexity, magnitude and quality requirements for the work inside the interior of the dam will require managers and supervisors with extensive experience and past performance managing and working on jobs of this type, scope and size.
This work requires design and fabrication of scaffolds or construction aids, which must be transported into the dam via circuitous routes.  This work requires removal of waste Calcite materials from work sites using scaffolds or construction aids.  The Calcite must be transported out of the dam via circuitous routes without impacts to existing facilities, equipment, or impacting drains.  This work requires surveying and documenting walls for cracks, pressure grouting the cracks identified on the cleaned wall and slot surfaces, and repairing joints and installing additional pipe supports for 20 to 24 inch diameter wet well and air vent piping.  The Offeror must develop a plan and method to prove that the gate slots are 100% clear of calcite to allow the removal of the Gate at a later time.  Removal of the actual gate is not included in this procurement.  This work requires designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system.  There is a positive security requirement at the site.  
PROVIDE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: Please note Teaming Partners and subcontractors experience may be used where applicable. Please provide information that addresses the following: 1. Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone; 8(a), etc.), and a point of contact. Also include the above information for any joint ventures/ teaming partners, subcontractors etc. 2. A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor. 3. Describe your firm's or teaming partner firm's capability and capacity to obtain bonding for the construction project up to $5 million dollars. The Government does not intend to limit bonding or use incremental bonding. We will require 100% bonding for this project. 4. Describe your firm's approach to managing the work required for this project, including any planned Teaming Partners and the organization structure, roles and responsibilities, and the overall execution of the work. If a teaming arrangement is being considered, provide the details of the joint venture agreement. 5. Describe your firm's capability and approach to managing a heavy civil project with work described above.  Provide resumes of key personnel that would be responsible for the management of this project.

<p>Capabilities package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of services provided and specifications related to this effort. The capabilities package should include at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. Contractor Name<br />2. Address<br />3. Point of Contact (POC) with phone number(s) and e-mail addresses<br />4. DUNS Number<br />5. Anticipated teaming arrangements if any (delineate between work accomplished by prime and work accomplished by teaming partners)<br />6. Provide responses of capabilities to specific work requirements. <br /><br />Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Services</p>
<p>DoS A/LM plans to award a performance-based professional services contract for the effort to deliver diplomatic pouch and mail services to its customers and compliment the work of Agency staff.</p>
<p>The objectives of this effort and contractor requirements are:</p>
<p>&bull; Form a cooperative relationship with a contractor to provide proactive solutions, cross-functional training, and values continuous process improvement.<br />&bull; Provide insight into mail operations and process engineering including a deep understanding of addressing schemes, bar-code technology, mail metering, zip codes and sorting techniques.<br />&bull; Provide receiving, sorting, pouching and handling resources for processing packages and mail to the correct customer in a timely, consistent, secure, undamaged and accountable way at a reasonable cost.<br />&bull; Effectively operate Government developed safety and security screening procedures.<br />&bull; Provide dispatch to Government provided freight forwarders and in the case of classified diplomatic pouch operations, the Diplomatic Courier Service.<br />&bull; Provide efficient integration and utilization of Government provided automated sorting technology over the term of the contract period including letter, flat mail and package sorters and the DoS Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), a logistics tracking IT system.<br />&bull; Align workforce to seasonal volume fluctuations, changes due to sorter automation and ILMS development<br />&bull; Adjust quickly to emerging terrorist threats affecting diplomatic pouch and mail activities or facilities</p>
<p>Constraints:</p>
<p>Security -- The workforce deployed to process classified diplomatic pouches will require Top Secret - Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) security clearances for the classified pouch operations. The unclassified pouch and mail operation will require background check, however no clearance is required.</p>
<p>As-is conditions:</p>
<p>&bull; Current direct labor totals 70+ FTEs in the unclassified pouch operations, supporting the interoffice mail operations and the classified pouch operations.<br />&bull; Current direct labor totals 12 FTEs in the classified pouch operations.<br />&bull; Current letter sorter is a Pitney Bowes Olympus II. A parcel sorter is also used that includes two intakes and two encoding stations enabling bar-coding and scanning of mail to 12 discharge areas where mail is pouched.</p>
<p><br />Specific work requirements:</p>
<p>Unclassified Pouch and Mail Processing:</p>
<p>Inbound mail is from multiple sources including local DoS annexes, other local ICASS Agencies, USPS and commercial carriers like UPS, FedEx, etc. Mail is processed from the transporting trucks, unloaded, scanned into ILMS, and prepared for further handling. Bulk mail is separated from letters, flat mail and parcels. <br /><br />Threat/hazard Screening is accomplished in specially designed containment rooms in coordination with other contract and Government resources</p>
<p>Mail Processing continues after the mail is cleared from screening. Mail is moved to the respective floor areas dedicated to each type of mail processing to effectively sort it by DoS destinations. Each mail type has its own process of handling, sorting, ILMS logging, and staging.</p>
<p>Tubs of letter and flat mail are processed with the automatic letter sorter which batches the mail for each destination. Sorted letter mail is wrapped in bundles and the bundle for each Post is then placed in the appropriate bag in the bag rack area. Large bins of flat mail (magazines, periodicals, advertising etc.) are hand sorted into separate bags by destination. Bags containing both flat and letter mail are sealed, tagged, scanned in ILMS in preparation for dispatch with pouches.</p>
<p>Parcels are sorted via an automatic parcel sorter and moved to the staging area established for each of 235 DoS worldwide destinations. In the staging area, pouches are loaded, scanning each item as it is entered. Diplomatic pouches are prepared in accordance with the dispatch schedule for freight forwarder pickup.</p>
<p>A constant vigilance for prohibited and hazardous items is present.</p>
<p>Classified Pouch and Mail Processing</p>
<p>Incoming mail is from a variety of ICASS participant agencies and via the DoS mail transportation trucks. Classified deliveries are accounted for in a chain of custody process, receipted, and logged in ILMS database tracking application. They are sorted in the facility specially designed for this purpose. The mail is sorted by destination - a total of over 235 overseas posts.</p>
<p>Individual pieces are aggregated into appropriate sized pouches. An invoice is generated for each pouch and placed inside the pouch. The pouches are sealed and tagged and made ready for dispatch to the Diplomatic Courier Service.</p>
<p>Period and Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The base period of performance will be one year from date of award with four one-year options.<br />The place of performance will be at Government facilities in the metro DC area. An unclassified mail facility is located near the Dulles airport. A classified mail facility is located near Springfield, VA.</p>
<p>Scope of Sources Sought:</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess the expertise, capability and experience to provide the full range of services identified above and with the immediate required level of staffing. DoS has a unique mail environment and it is of prime importance for sources to clearly understand and differentiate between it and traditional mailroom services. This extends both to handling classified mail but more importantly the volume, type and complexity of international mail. Sources must be able to provide staffing with the necessary experience, qualifications, and ability to assume full operational responsibility after a 30 day period of transition.</p>
<p>Sources should submit information clearly demonstrating capability in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Management approach including corporate strengths, processes, and procedures for managing, organizing, staffing, and ensuring quality mail services against the stated objectives above and with projects of similar size and type;</p>
<p>2) Specific and relevant past performance on same/similar work in size, scope and complexity and include applicable information for description, contract number, dollar value, period of performance, staffing size, and point of contact for verification (include as many relevant projects as applicable for the past five years);</p>
<p>3) Description of technical expertise and approach to provide the full gamut of DPM support including working with the threat of hazardous materials, working within a containment area, accounting for classified mail, accommodating physical handling of pouches weighing up to 70 pounds, handling workload fluctuations that are not predictable, and providing continuous process improvements through such means as use of new technology.</p>
<p><br />Vendor Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: cookcg@state.gov in a Microsoft Word/Adobe compatible format or mailed to Office of Acquisition Management, PO Box 9115, Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA 22219 to be received no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, 21 February 2014.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal or quote announcement.  This is a sources sought notice only, do not submit pricing.  Not responding to this sources sought does not preclude participation in any future and potential solicitation.  The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their business size classification relative to NAICS code 325412 and the small business size standard is 750 employees.

Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive medicines that are essential in order to perform Nuclear Medicine Scans on patients.

Radiopharmaceuticals must be prepared according to manufacturer's package inserts.  Deliveries of radiopharmaceuticals will incorporate sufficient lead or high-density metal shielding to comply with all applicable federal and/or state standards relating to shipment of radioactive materials.

<DESC><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Wildlife Services (WS) in Riverdale, MD intends to award a sole source Purchase to renew its on-line Subscriptions to The Human Wildlife Interactions Journal published by The Berryman Institute and Utah State University at a flat rate of $10,000.00.
<p>Human-Wildlife Interactions (ISSN 2155-3858 print, ISSN 2155-3874 online) is a peer reviewed journal published two times a year by the Jack H. Berryman Institute, Department of Wildland Resources, Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322-5230. The Material appearing in Human-Wildlife Interactions may not be reproduced in any form without the written consent of the publisher.<br /><br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 <br />The property or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of property or services will satisfy these needs.<br />The Berryman Institute is dedicated to improving human-wildlife relationships and resolving human-wildlife conflicts through teaching, and research. Wild Life services uses the information in the on-line journal as a resource tool to research articles in the areas of wildlife ecology, animal behavior, management applications, economics, and area wildlife relationships to humans.</p>
<p>Until 2010, the Wildlife Services program received a Congressional Directive in the amount of approximately $1 million which was directed to pass through to the Berryman Institute at Utah State University. As a result of the funding that Wildlife Services provided them, the Berryman Institute &amp; Utah State University gave Wildlife Services a certain number of hard copies of the Human/Wildlife Conflict Journal at no cost.</p>
<p>In 2010, Congress eliminated all Congressional Directives and the funding from the Congressional Directive was no longer available. Because Wildlife Services still desired to receive the Journal, because it is considered a valuable resource tool in relationship to their work; they've agreed to pay for subscriptions. Subscriptions to Human-Wildlife Interactions are $20 per year, domestic, and $40 per year, foreign. The Berryman Institute is giving Wildlife Services a considerable break in the cost per subscription. The $10,000 pays for the license which will then make the on&#8208;line Journal available to all of the 1,800 plus Wildlife Services employees.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Central Time (CT) by February 20, 2014. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511120, and the size standard is 500 Employees.<br /><br />Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Carol Dingess, Contracting Officer , USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, ASD Procurement Branch, 2150 Centre Avenue, <br />Building B MS (2E06), Fort Collins, CO 80526, or via email @ Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov or Fax to 970-472-1897</p>

<DESC><br />IARPA-RFI-14-04
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>Request for Information (RFI): Coding Societal Events</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information on methods to extract and code societal events from unstructured data, and information on existing structured databases of such events. For this RFI, a "societal event" is meant in a broad sense and includes, but is not limited to, social, political, epidemiological, cyber, economic, counterintelligence, and science and technology events. This RFI is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. The following sections of this announcement contain details on the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Scope</p>
<p>IARPA develops technologies to forecast a broad set of well-defined societal events relevant to national security. The test and evaluation process for these technologies requires an objective "ground truth" for events, generated in near-real-time. For many of the events of interest, the ground truth is developed by extracting events from unstructured data, often news text. IARPA is interested in event coding for specific classes of societal events, as well as solutions for retraining an event coder to code new event classes, as they emerge. The purpose of this RFI is to identify existing event coders and event data, and to identify potential approaches to event coding that would advance the state-of-the-art for future programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose of this RFI is to identify:<br />&bull;	Existing structured databases of societal events relevant to national security. Relevant events include those listed above. Databases that are in the public domain or to which the Government has rights are preferable, but commercial databases can also be included. Databases of historical events that are not maintained or up-to-date are not of interest. Detailed descriptions of the event class, the unstructured data source and coding method used, and the fields in the database should be included. Databases that include entries for event type, actor, date/time, and location, are preferred.<br />&bull;	Existing taxonomies/ontologies of specific event classes. The taxonomies/ontologies of interest are those for which events have explicit coding rules that a human analyst could follow with expectation of reasonable inter-coder agreement. Simple lists of events, with vague definitions, for an event class are not of interest. <br />&bull;	Existing methods (e.g., processes, models, or products) that detect a new, emergent event and/or actor class based on the analysis of streaming data and develop a taxonomy/ontology for that new class. Such methods need not be fully automated, but some automation is required. A discussion of how these methods could also support the development of explicit coding rules for the new class, and the level of efforts it would require to develop such coding rules, is of interest. <br />&bull;	Existing methods (e.g., processes, models, or products) that extract and code specific events from unstructured data. Such methods need not be fully automated, but some automation is required. Performance metrics for these methods are essential and should be included. Where possible, metrics should be compared to those published for other event coders, such as SERIF or TABARI. A discussion of how these methods perform across different data sources (e.g., news report versus blogs) is of interest, as are approaches to deduplicating event entries. A discussion of the cost to implement and maintain (e.g., in terms of data, methods, labor, and/or computational resources) is also of interest. <br />&bull;	Existing methods (e.g., processes, models, or products) to retrain an event coder to code a new class of events. Such methods need not be fully automated, but the level of effort required to train the event coder on the second class of events should be significantly less than the level of effort to train the event coder on the first class of events. Performance metrics for these methods are essential and should be included.<br />&bull;	Methods (e.g., processes, models, or products) that could be used as the basis for the development of a "generic" event coder. Such methods should generate outputs that can be processed to obtain a specific class of events, including the broad set of events envisioned in this RFI. These methods should also be able to integrate existing or new taxonomies/ontologies of specific event classes.<br />&bull;	Metrics and protocols to assess the performance of an event coder and the performance of the process required to train it to code a new class of events. We are particularly interested in metrics other than precision, recall, or F-measure.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should answer any or all of the following questions:<br />1)	What structured databases exist that contain both historical and frequently updated events relevant to national security? These events include, but are not limited to social, political, epidemiological, cyber, economic, counterintelligence, and science and technology events.<br />2)	What are existing taxonomies/ontologies of specific event and/or actor classes?<br />3)	What are existing methods to detect a new, emergent event and/or actor class based on the analysis of the streaming data?<br />4)	What are existing methods to extract and code events from unstructured data?<br />5)	What are existing methods to retrain an event coder to code a new class of events? <br />6)	What are existing methods that could be used as the basis for the development of a "generic" event coder capable of coding many new classes of events? <br />7)	What are metrics and protocols to assess the performance of an event coder and the performance of the process required to train it to code a new class of events?<br />8)	What novel approaches to event coding do you propose that would advance the state-of-the-art as described in your answers to questions 1-7?</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</p>
<p>IARPA requests that respondents submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues/obstacles, describe how the approach may address those issues/obstacles and comment on the expected performance and robustness of the proposed approach. If appropriate, respondents may also choose to provide a non-proprietary rough order of magnitude (ROM) regarding what such approaches might require in terms of funding and other resources for one or more years. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.</p>
<p>Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with RFI-14-04;<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary;<br />3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);<br />4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>

A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements quote mark  to Geomar Environmental Consultants, Inc., 2601 Sandy Hammock Lane, Coca Beach, FL 32926 for a fixed price contract to provide sea turtle beach nest monitoring to Brevard County, Florida, North Reach within the USACE Jacksonville District.  The boundaries of North Reach are from the immediate south of Canaveral Harbor to Patrick Air Force Base. <br>  <br> According to FDEP Permit No. 0137212-008-JC and 134869-002-JC for Flood Control and Coastal Emergency Shore Protection Project, Brevard County, Florida Beach Renourishment, North Reach and South Reach, pertaining to solicitation GROUP4-10-R-J009, a sea turtle monitor is required on the beach.  The sea turtle monitor must be permitted by the state.  Under Florida Statute 379.2431 (1) and Florida Administrative Code Rule 68E-1, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) can only issue a permit for sea turtle conservation work if there is a need for that activity.  On beaches where FWC has already issued a permit to an individual to conduct nesting surveys, they do not issue a second permit for the same work, as there is no need.  Permits are issued per beach and not per County, and only one Marine Turtle Permit is issued to an individual to conduct nesting surveys on a particular beach.  The current permit holder, Geomar Environmental Consultants, Inc., is available to conduct the monitoring during the pendency of this project.     <br>  <br> The primary objective of this contract is to have contractual access to a permitted and qualified contractor capable of conducting sea turtle monitoring from 1 March - 15 November 2014.  Additional objectives are to conduct early-morning surveys for marine turtle activities which shall include but are not limited to monitoring the beach for escarpments, erosion, hatchling disorientation, pertinent factors threaten nesting success and reproductive success; marking and excavating nests to provide statistically valid samples of loggerhead, green turtle and all leatherback turtle nests for the purpose of recording egg fates to assess hatching success and key nest productivity data; and conducting weekly visual surveys for escarpments at the seaward edges of the dune and the berm.  Professional execution of these activities by a state permitted organization is paramount due to the guidelines set forth in the acquired FDEP permits and the need to maintain the safety and productivity success rates of these endangered and threatened sea turtles.  The only way this can be accomplished is through the use of a contractor who fully understands this requirement and can accurately perform the work.   <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses may be submitted by e-mail to Tedra N. Thompson, (904) 232-2016, E-mail: tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil by Monday, February 10, 2014 by 12:00 p.m. EST.  <br>  <br> Point of Contact <br> Tedra N.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE <br> W912EP-14-T-0011 <br> Sea Turtle Beach Nest Monitoring - Brevard South <br>  <br> General Information <br> Document Type:   Notice of Intent to Sole Source 		  <br> Solicitation Number:  W912EP-14-T-0011  		 <br> Posted Date:  5 February 14			 <br> Response Date:  10 February 14	 <br> NAICS Code:  541620 <br>   <br> Contracting Office Address  <br> US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District <br> CESAJ-CT-S <br> Prudential Office Building <br> 701 San Marco Boulevard <br> Jacksonville, FL 32207-8175 <br>  <br> Description <br> THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements quote mark  to the University of Central Florida Marine Turtle Research Group: 4000 Central Florida Blvd. Orlando, FL 32816 for a fixed price contract to provide sea turtle beach nest monitoring to Brevard County, Florida, South Reach within the USACE Jacksonville District.  The boundaries of South Reach are from Indiatlantic Beach to Melbourne Beach South.  <br>  <br> According to FDEP Permit No. 0137212-008-JC and 134869-002-JC for Flood Control and Coastal Emergency Shore Protection Project, Brevard County, Florida Beach Renourishment, North Reach and South Reach, pertaining to solicitation GROUP4-10-R-J009, a sea turtle monitor is required on the beach.  The sea turtle monitor must be permitted by the state.  Under Florida Statute 379.2431 (1) and Florida Administrative Code Rule 68E-1, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) can only issue a permit for sea turtle conservation work if there is a need for that activity.  On beaches where FWC has already issued a permit to an individual to conduct nesting surveys, they do not issue a second permit for the same work, as there is no need.  Permits are issued per beach and not per County, and only one Marine Turtle Permit is issued to an individual to conduct nesting surveys on a particular beach.  The current permit holder, the University of Central Florida Marine Turtle Research Group, is available to conduct the monitoring during the pendency of this project.     <br>  <br> The primary objective of this contract is to have contractual access to a permitted and qualified contractor capable of conducting sea turtle monitoring from 1 March - 15 November 2014.  Additional objectives are to conduct early-morning surveys for marine turtle activities which shall include but are not limited to monitoring the beach for escarpments, erosion, hatchling disorientation, pertinent factors threaten nesting success and reproductive success; marking and excavating nests to provide statistically valid samples of loggerhead, green turtle and all leatherback turtle nests for the purpose of recording egg fates to assess hatching success and key nest productivity data; and conducting weekly visual surveys for escarpments at the seaward edges of the dune and the berm.  Professional execution of these activities by a state permitted organization is paramount due to the guidelines set forth in the acquired FDEP permits and the need to maintain the safety and productivity success rates of these endangered and threatened sea turtles.  The only way this can be accomplished is through the use of a contractor who fully understands this requirement and can accurately perform the work.   <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses may be submitted by e-mail to Tedra N. Thompson, (904) 232-2016, E-mail: tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil by Monday, February 10, 2014 by 12:00 p.m. EST.  <br>  <br> Point of Contact <br> Tedra N.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

State of the science (e.g., Vecitis et al., [2009]) indicates that simple oxidative and reductive approaches may not work with these recalcitrant compounds as independent remedial options. In addition, the Air Force prefers in situ remediation technologies; however, PFAS remediation challenges may dictate the use of ex situ technologies. For example, treatment trains as part of an existing pump and treatment system may be appropriate. Offerors should consider any relative successes or failures as highlighted by Vecitis et al., 2009, the AFCEC Restoration BAA Program, and Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development and Environmental Security Technology Certification Programs (SERDP/ESTCP).

The waste collected from the OWSs in 2012 consisted of 9,000 gallons of oil, 10,000 gallons of sludge and 10,000 gallons of water. The proposals should identify a process that will streamline the waste treatment and disposal process. The process must remove enough water from the sludge so that it can be disposed to land and the water must be clean enough to be disposed of to the sewer. The proposals must demonstrate a complete return on investment (ROI). ROI should include; operating cost, estimated manpower, cost to test the waste prior to final disposal (per RCRA hazardous waste requirements), and any other applicable costs. Oil removed from the waste stream will be recycled. Water removed from the process will be sent to the sewer and tested quarterly and therefore testing cost does not need to be included. JBER will be the location to test and demonstrate the process. The building available for the treatment process includes a 2900 square foot fenced pole barn with eight inches of freeboard and a 2500 square foot heated building with three 10 foot garage doors also with eight inches of freeboard.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

The goal of the requirements listed in this section is to purchase for the LOC, a flooring surface for this space that will be durable, maintainable, and will harmonize with the  architectural features in the space.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Request for Quotation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>Contractors should be aware that this is a Military Installation and that all access to this installation is granted by the 106 Rescue Wing Security Forces. Prior to making deliveries please contact (631) 723-7478 and follow instructions provided by the Security Forces for access to the 106th Rescue Wing, Gabreski Airport, NY. If a gate pass is not granted to a contractor allowing the delivery of goods, execution of warranty support, or performance of services please contact the contracting officer.<br />A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away.</p>
<p>A list of all prospective contractors (full name, date of birth, social security number, and home address) will be provided to Security Forces by the vendor no less than 21 business days from the date work is expected to start, for the purposes of a criminal history check. Note: All additions, deletions and/or changes to the contractor list provided to security forces will require the 21 work day lead time, unless otherwise agreed upon between Security Forces, Environmental, and Base Contracting, for the purposes of a criminal history check. The following is a guide to who will be allowed access to the installation.</p>
<p>1. All prospective contractors MUST be U.S. citizens or MUST have established and maintain legal residence in the U.S., and be authorized by the US government to work in the United States (i.e. Green card, worker authorization, etc.). All prospective contractors MUST have at least one form of U.S. government issued photo identification (driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. work visa, etc.) for entry to the installation. Security Forces will review any questionable identification documents for determination as to whether or not said identification is authorized for access to the installation.</p>
<p>2. All prospective contractors, once it has been established that they maintain the appropriate credential as described in paragraph 1 above, are subject to a Criminal History Check. If a prospective contractor is found to have been "arrested" (conviction not required) within the last ten (10) years for any of the following offenses as defined in The New York State Penal Laws: any felony assault; draft evasion; any felony drug charges; Indecent acts or liberties with a child under 16; molestation to include child pornography and sex abuse; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; rape and related sex offences; robbery; arson; felony criminal mischief; fire arms offences; any grand larceny; burglary and felony larceny charges; any charges related to terrorism; any active warrants from any jurisdiction; and any other offense deemed to be in the best interest of the government to refuse entry to having persons committed them, the prospective contractor will not be allowed legal access to the installation for the purpose of employment, unless otherwise agreed upon by Security Forces, Civil Engineering, Base Contracting, and authorized by the Base Commander.</p>
<p>Note: For the purposes of Contracting services at the 106 RQW, it is implied that, by the contracting agreement, that any and all parties agree to a Criminal History Background Check once entering into any contract with the 106 RQW. Any documents that are provided and found fraudulent to include, but not be limited to driver's licenses, contracting licenses, etc., will result in an arrest and potential termination for default of the contract. All contractors are subject to search in order to obtain entry onto the installation and while working on the installation. Any refusal to submit to a search of their person or vehicle will be deemed as a violent act of aggression against the installation and will be cause for dismissal from the installation and revocation of future privileges and installation access.</p>
<p>A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away. The U.S. Government will not be held liable for any delays or breach of contract caused by refusal of the 106th RQW Security Forces.</p>

<p>Projects under the contract shall be awarded on individual task orders. The types of task order submittals may include, but are not limited to, inspection and condition assessment reports, engineering alternatives analyses and basis of repair/design reports, engineering calculations, engineering plans and specifications, construction cost estimates, seismic assessment, hydrodynamic analysis, soil borings/tests, and technical reviews. Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings using computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), per the A/E CADD Standard, and specifications produced in SPECSINTACT with Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) using the Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS); Building Information Model (BIM) Modeling, Waterfront UNIFORMAT II classifications standard; contract bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; static and dynamic structural analyses using finite element computer modeling; two and three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including use of finite element models and time history acceleration data for linear and/or nonlinear analyses of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes and nonlinear dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI).</p>
<p>A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment. This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations. Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, dams, levees, water control structures, instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, underwater cables, or any similar structure. All waterfront facility assessments, including underwater inspections will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers. For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC). That EIC shall dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports. The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report. The EIC shall ensure that all field inspection operations, including diving, are performed in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements EM 385-1-1 (September 2008).</p>
<p>The A&amp;E firm/team shall have the capacity to support at minimum three simultaneous facility inspections while still meeting the requirements of the contract for prime contractor performance.</p>
<p>B:<br />This synopsis will result in the award of a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for work to be accomplished outside of the continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
<p>Additionally, the OCONUS contract award will act as overflow support for Waterfront Inspection Services CONUS Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Based on an anticipated workload in those regions and in an effort to properly manage overflow in case of emergencies in regions 1, 2, 3 and 4, the OCONUS contractor may be used to supplement overflow capacity and augment services under contingency when the small business prime contractors for those regions acknowledge their inability to accept additional work due to limitations in capacity. The regional CONUS prime contractors will be given the right of first refusal of a task order in their region should their current capacity be met by other task orders currently awarded. Exercising the right of first refusal would not be a negative reflection on the small business prime and would enable solicitation to the OCONUS prime contractor, ultimately enabling the navy the ability to satisfy and meet mission needs. The final decision and approval for this overflow capacity redistribution will be made by the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Each Task Order under this contract will be fixed price. Pricing information will be requested of the selected firm for each Task Order. The duration of the contract will be for one year from the date of an initial contract award (Base year), with four (4) additional one-year option ordering periods. The aggregate value of all Task Orders issued under the contract resulting from this solicitation (including any task order overflow support in CONUS regions 1, 2, 3 and 4) shall not exceed $15,000,000.00. This is a combined value for base and all option years. The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government. If the dollar capacity of the previous year has not been utilized, the capacity will be added to the following option year (if exercised). The IDIQ contract type minimum guarantee of $10,000 for the entire contract term, including option years, will be satisfied either by the award of an initial Task Order or multiple Task Orders. Individual Task Orders are expected to range, on average, between $50,000 and $500,000. The prime contractor is required to perform 50% of the work (in dollars).<br /><br />Contractor personnel working on this contract shall be U.S. Citizens.<br /><br />Security Requirements: Work performed will be at the SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED level. The government does not anticipate the need for a security clearance, however, if clearances are subsequently required the contractor shall comply with SECNAV M5510.30, SECNAV Instruction M-5239.2, and Department of Defense (DoD) 8570.01-M. The contractor shall establish and maintain an access list of those employees working on the Contract.<br /><br />C:<br />Evaluation and selection will be based on most highly qualified firm upon evaluation of the criteria stated herein.

If the project is a Department of Defense/Government contract, include the complete contract number, including the task order number if applicable. Submit a brief but explicit description of the project, project's relevance to the contract, and the A-E fee within block 24 of SF330, Section F. Firms with multiple offices shall indicate which office performed the services. <br />In addition:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Submit at least one project demonstrating self-performance experience of a complete building retro-commissioning including Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Submit at least one project demonstrating self-performance design experience with Digital Direct Controls or Energy Management Control Systems schematic and architecture.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Submit at least one project demonstrating self-performance experience in the production of a Design-Bid-Build (DBB) construction contract packages (i.e., drawings, specifications, basis of design, design analysis, engineering calculations, cost estimate, etc.).<br />If the proposed team is a joint venture (JV), information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for each joint venture partner, while ensuring you do not exceed the maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the firm should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

(2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Fort Greely is located along the Richardson Highway, approximately 100 miles south of Fairbanks Alaska. Fort Greely is near Delta Junction, Alaska which as limited housing and support facilities. The eight buildings are all located in the same general area along Third Street in the Cantonment area of Fort Greely. Each building is a townhouse style eight-plex with approximate 15,000 square footage per building. The buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are spread footing, concrete foundations with wood framing. Six of the buildings have attached garage additions that will also be removed. Hazardous surveys have been conducted, and all the buildings have extensive asbestos, which must be removed before final demolition. Various site work around the buildings will be removed including parking lots, Headbolt outlets, stoops, electrical, utilidors, and sidewalks. The utilidors will be demolished back to the mainlines and are assumed to contain asbestos covered piping. The foundation holes will be filled with classified fill and the area will be graded, receive topsoil and seeded. There will be a 58% diversion goal from landfills for all non-hazardous construction debris. The base landfill will be available for disposal of asbestos material and other Construction waste. The area is next to existing occupied housing areas, so noise, safety, dust, etc. are important to manage on this project.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 10 February 2014.</p>

<p>Answer:<br /><strong>1) The project is run of river. It is not intermittent. The canal provides water 365 days a year. There is a reservoir upstream and the area is highly agricultural. </strong></p>
<p>Question<br />2) In terms of the power purchase agreement, is the 13 cents "energy" or "capacity and energy"? If only energy, a capacity fee makes the project much more financeable.<br /><br />Answer:<br /><strong>2) The PPA is energy based not capacity/energy based. </strong></p>

<DESC><p>__________________________________________________________________________<br />DRAFT REQUEST for PROPOSAL&nbsp;<br />OC-ALC Material Support Integrator</p>
<p>This Request for Information only is being utilized for market research in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.201(e). This is not a Request for Proposal, and the government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC) is comprised of five (5) major groups located in twenty seven (27) different buildings across six square miles at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The number of buildings could increase over the life of this requirement. The Government will provide 2646sq. ft. of Industrial space and 560sq. ft. of admin space and the required computers to access the database. The groups perform a variety of aircraft, propulsion, and commodities related maintenance and support work. All of the groups require non aircraft shop support related items and Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE). Automated Point of Use (POU) devices are utilized by the Complex to issue these PPE and common use items such as drills, reamers, cutting tools, abrasives and common construction material in support of the maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aircraft, engines, commodities and production related equipment. The POU is an automated device using Automated Point of Use Databases (APUDs) to track and update the usage of items contained within the various POU devices. There are currently&nbsp;seventeen (17) non-automated storage areas or cribs and&nbsp;202 automated POU locations and 359 POU pieces of equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials. The contract currently requires approximately 11K line items per month and the database generates approximately 20K transactions per month. These estimates are expected to increase throughout the life of the contract. The OC-ALC has a need for a Material Support Integrator (MSI) to effectively manage this requirement.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK <br />The MSI shall maintain a comprehensive program for the OC-ALC inventory management systems to include common use items and POU devices. The contractor shall maintain day-to-day operations to include all labor, supervision, materials, tools, equipment, PPE, interim storage, transportation, and incidentals. The contractor shall be responsible for obtaining material and supply agreements with individual vendors to provide all the PPE and materials identified in draft Exhibit 1, POU Common Use Item List (CUIL). The contractor shall provide program management, strategic analysis for future needs, recommendations to increase efficiencies, recommendations for replacement of items which become obsolete, improve cost savings and ensure compliance with applicable laws, directives, and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract is contemplated.</p>
<p>The proposed basic period of performance (PoP) is: 19 Dec 2014 - 18 Nov 2015</p>
<p>The proposed PoP for Option Year 1 is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>19 Nov 2015 - 18 Nov 2016</p>

<p>The proposed PoP for Option Year 3 is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>19 Nov 2017 - 18 Nov 2018</p>
<p>The proposed PoP for Option Year 4 is:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>19 Nov 2018 - 18 Nov 2019</p>
<p><br />The estimated award date is 17 November 2014. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, attend the Pre-solicitation Conference scheduled for 5 Mar 2014(details posted soon as mod to this notice), and/or submit proposals once the official RFP is released.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/%20">https://www.fbo.gov/</a>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>No telephone requests.

Introduction  <br>    <br>  Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to procure a Data Correlation and Fusion Manager (DCFM) software component for the Joint Common Architecture (JCA) Demonstration (JCA Demo) project.  <br>    <br>  The overall purpose of the JCA Demo is to verify the JCA concept and reduce risk for future efforts.  The DCFM developed under the JCA Demo will not become the basis of any subsequent program activity, but knowledge gained will be used as input to the Government's planning processes.  Processes, tools, and lessons learned are more important than component performance.  <br>    <br>  2.  Background  <br>    <br>  The Aviation & Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently developing an open system architecture (OSA) definition for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) family of systems (FoS) under the JCA Science and Technology (S&T) effort.  JCA is following the Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) principles and leveraging existing and emerging OSA related efforts (including the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) consortium).  JCA in its final form will comprise a model, guidance documents and an ecosystem.  JCA version 1.0 is not projected to be available until the end of FY15; however, it is the Government's desire to perform a proof of concept demonstration starting in FY14 with a partial version (V0.X).  <br>    <br>  The JCA Program has five overarching program goals:   <br>    <br>       Increase affordability  <br>       Reduce time to field  <br>       Enable new technology integration  <br>       Accommodate mission performance requirements  <br>       Address applicable mandates  <br>    <br>  JCA defines a software product line (SPL) which consists of key interfaces as well as the software components of an avionics system that can be reused across the entire FVL FoS.  This enables the achievement of higher level Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) affordability goals that would not automatically be achieved if developers or Program Offices worked independently.     <br>    <br>  In following the MOSA principle of establishing an  quote mark enabling environment, quote mark  the JCA S&T effort teamed with the Navy and Industry to stand-up an open, consensus based, standards body.  The Open Group managed FACE Consortium is an Industry and Government partnership to establish a standard Common Operating Environment (COE) for capability-based applications across Department of Defense (DoD) avionics systems.  FACE standards, documentation, tools, and processes form the basis of JCA wherever possible.  <br>    <br>  JCA will comprise the following:   <br>    <br>       JCA Model - The JCA Model represents a collection of existing widely used and Industry-accepted standards, the reference architecture, and supporting documentation.  The JCA Reference Architecture is a conceptual framework identifying a set of avionics subsystems, avionics components, their interfaces, their allocated functionality, common semantics and composition rules at the Domain, Subsystem, and Component levels.  <br>    <br>       Guidance Documentation - The Guidance documentation will cover Security/Information Assurance, Contracting, System Safety and Airworthiness, and Systems and Software Engineering.  <br>    <br>       Ecosystem - The Ecosystem will utilize efforts developed within the FACE Consortium and Army/Navy FACE Academic Project to provide the simulation tools, integrator and developer toolkits, conformance testing tools, a repository of JCA artifacts, and a reference application.  <br>    <br>  3.  Detailed Topic Description  <br>    <br>  SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There is one topic under this announcement.    <br>    <br>  TOPIC: JMR Technology Demonstrator Joint Common Architecture Demonstration (JCA Demo)  <br>    <br>    3.1.  Overview  <br>    <br>  JCA Demo seeks to achieve the following goals:  <br>       Verify the JCA concept by:  <br>       o  Procuring products defined by JCA V0.X in a representative acquisition process  <br>       o  Developing a JCA component utilizing the Ecosystem  <br>       Reduce risk for subsequent JMR TD efforts by:  <br>       o  Understanding the level of effort (resources, cost, and schedule) required to implement  <br>       o  Estimate potential benefits for the FVL FoS  <br>    <br>  JCA Demo will achieve these goals by procuring a software component defined by the JCA Model and verify that it is:  <br>       Modular - Functionality scoped and defined by JCA Model V0.X  <br>       Portable - Executes on a common Operating Environment (OE) conformant to the FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0  <br>       Interchangeable -External interfaces are open and defined using FACE data model  <br>    <br>  The JCA Demo will procure a software component built to the same specifications from multiple vendors.  The Government will integrate and compile each software component to operate on multiple OEs.  The demonstration will consist of executing a common scenario for each software component on each OE in the lab.  While the performance of each software component on each OE will be evaluated, the goal is to verify the JCA concept, not procure the most functional software component.   <br>    <br>     3.2.  Technical Description  <br>    <br>           3.2.1.  Software Component  <br>    <br>  The software component to be procured under this BAA is a Data Correlation & Fusion Manager (DCFM) defined as a FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0 Portable Component Segment (PCS) Unit of Portability (UoP).  This software component was selected based on available Government resources and is generically defined with a minimal set of functionality for demonstration purposes.  The DCFM UoP is being developed specifically for laboratory use and therefore has no airworthiness requirements (Design Assurance Level-E) despite being restricted to the FACE Safety Profile.  The DCFM UoP is specified through a combination of textual descriptors and a data model provided in the  quote mark Supplemental Package. quote mark   See  quote mark Section 9.1 Instructions to Offerors quote mark  on how to obtain.  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL provide behavior and performance characteristics of the DCFM UoP to the government throughout the development process.  <br>    <br>           3.2.2.  Operating Environments  <br>    <br>  Each OE consists of an ARINC 653 FACE Safety Profile partition with FACE IOS & TSS Layers on a General Purpose Processor (GPP).  The DCFM UoP will be allocated at least 384 MB of RAM and 20% of the GPP (minimum GPP operates at 1 GHz).  <br>    <br>          3.2.3.  Candidate FACE Tools  <br>    <br>  The Government seeks verification of the Candidate FACE Tools.  Since the FACE Technical Standard continues to evolve and the tools are constantly being updated to reflect the changes, the intention is to utilize the latest version available at contract award.  <br>    <br>  The Candidate FACE Tools are available at https://face.isis.vanderbilt.edu/.  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL use the FACE Modeling Tools with the supplied DCFM Data Model to generate the data type and component files to produce the DCFM code set files.  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL use the FACE Conformance Test Suite to verify conformance of the DCFM.  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL submit issues to the Candidate FACE Tools through the  quote mark New issue quote mark  page on the Candidate FACE Tools website.  <br>    <br>  3.2.4.  Reusable Verification  <br>    <br>  To perform verification of the DCFM UoP on each OE the Government requires a Reusable Verification Component (RVC) that consists of a platform agnostic software test harness (e.g. software test fixture), platform agnostic automated test scripts (e.g. Python), and the necessary documentation (e.g. test cases and operator instructions.)  The RVC provides the full suite of capabilities required to perform a verification that the DCFM UoP operates as intended and satisfies its software requirements while executing within each OE. The RVC captures the input conditions (parameters, ranges, sequences, etc), expected results (pass/fail criteria), and traceability data which maps RVC test cases to their corresponding DCFM UoP software requirements. This ensures compatibility with the host hardware and provides verification of the platform integration as life-cycle changes are made to each OE.  <br>    <br>  3.2.5.  FACE Verification  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL demonstrate how the DCFM UoP meets the requirements of the FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0.  The Government will perform the functions of a FACE Verification Authority.    <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL deliver preliminary FACE verification evidence, an initial FACE Verification Package, and a final FACE Verification Package.  <br>    <br>    <br>  3.2.6.  Government Lab  <br>    <br>  For this demonstration the Government will serve as the Systems Integrator with all supporting equipment and personnel resident at the Aviation Systems Integration Facility (ASIF) on Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.  The government lab will include a software developer's workstation with all the necessary C/C++ compilers for the FACE Safety Profile OS's selected.    <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL support Government lab integration efforts and FACE verification activities via voice and/or web based communication up to 80 hours.  <br>    <br>  3.2.7.  Proprietary Information  <br>    <br>  Government Support Contractors will be used in the lab to perform the integration tasks.  DCFM UoP developers need to address any proprietary tools or software items and address mitigation strategies (e.g. non-disclosure agreements) within the technical proposal.  Government support contractors are currently covered by a non-disclosure agreement in connection with the AMCOM Express contract.  A copy of this non-disclosure agreement is available upon request.  DCFM UoP developers may enter into an additional proprietary information agreement with Government support contractors at their option.        <br>    <br>  3.2.8.  Lessons Learned  <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL participate in regularly scheduled meetings to discuss development progress as well as lessons learned relevant to the JCA concept and FACE products.    <br>    <br>  DCFM UoP developers SHALL identify airworthiness implications that would need to be addressed if the DCFM UoP were targeted for a safety-critical implementation.  <br>    <br>  4.  Data Rights  <br>    <br>  The Government requires sufficient Data Rights and Licensing for the DCFM UoP and any additional aspects (e.g. COTS libraries) that enable integration of the DCFM UoP on the target OEs during the course of the JCA Demo effort and other future Government experimentation.  Future experimentation may include, but is not limited to, integrating on additional OEs, upgrading hardware components, replacing FACE software components (OS/IOS/TSS/PCS), testing data model scalability/extensibility, and virtual integration into different systems architectures/designs.    <br>    <br>  Offeror's SHALL document all aspects of Technical Data, Computer Software, and Computer Software Documentation in Section 9.3  quote mark Proposal Volume II - Technical Data and Computer Software Rights volume quote mark  and Section 9.5  quote mark Proposal Volume IV - Cost. quote mark     <br>    <br>  5.  Funding Level And Performance Period  <br>    <br>  Anticipated funding will vary based on proposed approach. This topic is expected to result in multiple awards.  Total funding available for all awards is anticipated to be $800K.  Any award is subject to the availability of funds.  The Period of Performance will begin at award and last for eight (8) months.  Delivery of the DCFM is expected within four (4) months of award with the remaining time for integration support and report generation.  <br>    <br>  6.  Funding Instrument  <br>    <br>  The instrument preferred by the Government is a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358), which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371).  In accordance with the DoDGARS, Parties proposing to carry out a research project under a TIA are asked to provide at least half of the costs of the project, to the maximum extent practicable.  This is a statutory condition for those TIAs under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and is a matter of DoD policy for all other TIAs.  The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the Offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.  <br>    <br>  7.  Security Requirements  <br>    <br>  Performance may require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, (Title 50, U.S.C.

Evaluation Factors for Award  <br>    <br>  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The ratings and narratives will be used to develop an order of merit listing.  Proposed cost will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness.  <br>    <br>  The following evaluation factors apply:   <br>       <br>  10.1.  EVALUATION FACTOR I - Technical Approach and Processes  <br>    <br>  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's ability to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the complete range of tasks, requirements, and goals set forth in the Topic Description and Supplemental Package.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's:  <br>    <br>  10.1.1.  Approach to accomplishing the tasks and requirements set forth in the Topic Description and Supplemental Package.  <br>    <br>  10.1.2.  Proposed software development process and associated tools.  <br>    <br>  10.1.3.  Approach to meeting the requirements of the FACE Technical Standard for the DCFM UoP and plan for developing and providing FACE Verification Evidence.  <br>    <br>  10.2.  EVALUATION FACTOR II - Technical Data and Computer Software Rights Factor  <br>    <br>  In evaluating the Data Rights and Patent Rights, the Government will use information in the proposal to assess the extent to which the rights in Technical Data (TD), Computer Software (CS), Computer Software Documentation (CSD), and Inventions/Patents offered to the Government ensue unimpeded, innovative, and cost effective development, operation, maintenance, and upgrade of the DCFM UoP throughout its life cycle.  <br>    <br>  Proposals will not be rated less than ACCEPTABLE on this factor solely because an Offeror does not offer a price for the Government Purpose Rights Option CLIN. However, ratings on this factor for proposals to deliver TD, CSD, or SW with less than the minimum rights specified for the Government by applicable statute (10 U.S.C. 2320) and regulation (DFARS 252.227-7013, 252.227-7014, and 252.227-7015) may be negatively impacted. For non-commercial acquisitions, these rights include: Unlimited Rights in TD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(1)) and CS and CSD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(1)); Limited Rights in TD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(3)); and Restricted Rights in CS (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(3)). The minimum rights considered for TD associated with commercial item acquisitions are specified in DFARS 252.227-7015(b)(1). For commercial FACE software acquisitions, evaluation of the offered rights will assess their consistency with Federal procurement law and satisfaction of Government user needs in accordance with the policy in DFARS 227.7202-1(a).  <br>    <br>  Ratings on this factor for proposals to deliver TD, CSD, or SW with more than the minimum rights specified for the Government by applicable statute and regulation may be positively impacted.  <br>    <br>  10.3.  EVALUATION FACTOR III - Technical Experience and Qualifications  <br>    <br>  In assessing the Offeror's past performance, the Government will evaluate the relevant past performance examples(s) (e.g., experiences, contracts and subcontracts) which demonstrate the following:  <br>  10.3.1.	The Offeror's previous experience with open architecture, Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), MOSA and/or FAE within the last five (5) years.  <br>    <br>  10.3.2.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing data fusion, data correlation, or similar software for embedded avionics systems.  <br>    <br>  10.3.3.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing software for real-time safety-critical embedded systems.  <br>    <br>  10.3.4.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing software using machine readable data models.  <br>    <br>  10.3.5.  Qualifications, suitability, and availability of key personnel performing the proposed work.  <br>    <br>  10.3.6.  Qualifications, suitability, and availability of facilities to perform the proposed work.  <br>    <br>  10.4.  EVALUATION FACTOR IV - Cost   <br>    <br>  10.4.1.  The Government will evaluate realism of the proposed man-hour, material, and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort (see FAR 2.101 -  quote mark Definitions, quote mark  Cost Realism).  Costs to the Government of any required GFE/GFI of facilities will also be included in the evaluation.  <br>    <br>  10.4.2.  The Government will evaluate the following costs with respect to how they impact further use of the DCFM UoP.  <br>    <br>  10.4.2.1.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Noncommercial Technical Data (TD), Noncommercial Computer Software (CS), and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation (CSD)  <br>    <br>  10.4.2.2.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Commercial Computer Software (CS) and Commercial Computer Software Documentation (CSD) and Commercial Technical Data (TD)  <br>    <br>  10.4.2.3.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Background Inventions   <br>    <br>  Evaluation Factors are ranked from most important (I) to least important (IV).  <br>    <br>  11.

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  <br>    <br>  Description  <br>    <br>  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Eustis (MICCC-E) is seeking information on approaches and methods that can be used to remotely manage Digital Training Facilities (DTF) for the Product Director Distributed Learning System (PD DLS) located at 11846 Rock Landing Dr, Newport News, VA.  The Army is seeking market research, potential sources, and best practice information to remotely manage 215 DTFs located at 88 geographically separated locations throughout the world. The DTF is a digital class room supporting up to 12 students at Reserve Component locations or up to 16 students at Army Active installations.  The DTFs supports collective (group) training by providing classroom style environments.  DTFs provide networked computers that support digital training, Video Tele-training equipment supporting courseware transmission from remote sites, and servers to interface Army intranets and the internet.  DTFs also provide individual Soldiers with an on-base location to access web-based, job related and professional courses.  The DLS network is centrally managed through an Enterprise Management Center (EMC) located on Fort Eustis, VA.  A Government Distributed Learning Point of Contract (DLPOC) is appointed at each location.  All DTF equipment and furnishings are currently provided by the Government.  Security cameras with remote monitoring capability are installed in each DTF.    <br>    <br>  Current Operations:  <br>    <br>  The DLS currently provides an on-site DTF Manager (DTFM) at each location to support the DTFs.  The DTFM operates the DTF by scheduling user training, controlling access to the facility, inventorying the DTF equipment, and ensuring the facility is maintained in a neat and orderly configuration.  The DTFM provides daily operational checks and reports equipment troubles to the EMC, assists the EMC to validate/correct system and equipment troubles, coordinates on-site support for periodic equipment/facility upgrades, and provides support materials (e.g. printer supplies).  The DTFM validates the credentials (common access card (CAC) and other personal identification) of new users of the DTF, submits a request for a user ID to the EMC, and enters the DTF domain on the user's CAC.  The DTFM also assists new users of DTF equipment to access the DLS network as well as helps the user to locate and navigate on-line training courseware.  The DTFM promotes the capabilities of the DLS and DTF to encourage usage of the facilities by local Army units and personnel.  The DTFM also collects and reports data on facility usage.    <br>    <br>  Technical Criteria  <br>    <br>  The Remote DTF Management (RDTFM) should be able to support seven (7) primary areas and specific information of interest is as follows:  <br>    <br>  1.	DTF Operations - The RDTFM must support daily operations of the DTF including.  <br>    <br>  a.	Control access to the DTF.  The RDTFM must be capable of providing controlled access by verifying the credentials of personnel requesting access to the facility.  The DTF must monitor activities to identify unauthorized use or activities.   <br>    <br>  b.	Schedule training in the DTFs.  The RDTFM must provide a capability for users to schedule the DTF for training.  The RDTFM must de-conflict requests for DTF usage.

<DESC><p><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Disposable ECG Electrodes through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 01 June 2014. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: A complete product line of Disposable ECG Electrodes for standard testing/diagnostic and monitoring ECG applications to include repositionable, radiolucent and radio-opaque types of electrodes with a variety of adhesive backings (paper, paper/substrates, foam, foam/substrates, soft cloth, cloth/substrates, micro-pore tape, vinyl tape/vinyl substrates, and clear tape), in both snap and tab styles, having a variety of pre-gelled designs (wet-gel, liquid gel, solid gel, sticky gel, conductive gel, or adhesive gels) and available in a variety of sizes ranging from zero to three inches in diameter. The Disposable ECG Electrodes are latex-free or latex-safe, single patient use and with a defined shelf life.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Disposable ECG Electrodes will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

In addition to completing this form, an electronic registration request must be submitted through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>. The solicitation timeline (listed below) has also been revised. * <br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

PROPOSAL DUE DATE IS EXTENDED FROM FEBRUARY 14, 2014 to MARCH 28, 2014.<br />See amendment A003 for specific details.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires data comparison to determine the level of care offered to Veterans at their medical centers.  Specifically, The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) has developed the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR).  The NCDR is the only recognized national registry/database that collects and reports on standardized national clinical cardiovascular data. Use of the NCDR permits confidential comparisons of a participant's data with national or regional summary data in order to monitor cardiac care performance in an effort to improve patient care.  
This acquisition will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

VA data will be obtained from the Cardiovascular Assessment Reporting and Tracking System (CART).   The CART database is located at the Denver VA.  All administrative management for CART will be completed at the Denver VA.  Medical Centers will send their information to the Denver VA.  The Denver VA will be the only medical center to interface with the NCDR.  Once data is submitted to the NCDR, NCDR will compare the information to a National Database and submit a report to the Denver VA regarding the VA's healthcare as it pertains to cardio patients.
"The CathPCI Registry  assesses the characteristics, treatments and outcomes of cardiac disease patients who receive diagnostic catheterization and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures."  This will allow the VA to compare their medical centers performance with the national aggregate performance.  This will help the VA to improve medical care to the Veterans.  This information from the registry will also help VA medical centers "reduce procedural complications, support quality improvement initiatives," and help ensure compliance with reporting requirements of regulatory agencies.   https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/cathpci/

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  
	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1.	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  

In an effort to provide the most effective medical care while still being cost-effective, the VA needs to participate and have access to this database to use as a measurement of the healthcare given to Veterans.  There is no other database with this medical information, gathered from private and governmental medical facilities.   
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

VETBIZ was searched and there are no companies that offer the registry database subscription.  A notice of intent to sole source was posted on 11/6/2013 and closed on 11/22/2013.  There were not any responses to this Notice.  

The internet was searched and there were not any other companies identified as offering this same database.   The previous contract (VA260-P-0551) was also a sole source.  An internet search was also conducted (in the previous acquisition) and there were not any other companies found that offered this database service.  
7.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by posting a Notice of Intent to Sole Source which advised industry of the proposed acquisition; the Internet (web search) was conducted; and VetBizOpps was searched.    

8.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

None. 

9.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: 

See Section VI above. 

10.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

This is a unique registry and is only available through the ACCF.  As this is an ongoing data registry which has a unique list of members and ongoing data, this is most likely a continued sole source.

<p>Contractor: TASC, Inc.<br />100 Brickstone Square<br />Andover, MA 01810-1438</p>
<p>Contracting Officer: Renee Berry, DSN 633-9052, Commercial: (310) 653-9052</p>
<p><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>This Limited Source Justification authorizes the use of restricted competition (other than full and open) for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) support provided by TASC Inc. under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) # GS23F0008K, Task Order# FA8814-11-F-0003.</p>
<p>Task Order # FA8814-11-F-0003 was competitively awarded 21 January 2011, using GSA Schedule GS23F0008K which utilized ordering procedures under FAR 8.405-2. The Period of Performance (PoP) for the task order ended 19 July 2013. However, in the interest of economy and efficiency, the task order was extended in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) through 20 January 2014.</p>
<p>Presently, an urgent and compelling need exists for the extension of this Task Order. The resultant modification to the task order, in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), will extend the PoP by 12 months. The contract type for this effort will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</p>
<p><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS:</p>
<p>The Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XR) is responsible for the planning of future space capabilities, including research, technology development, concept demonstrations and projects, mission area architectures and roadmaps, the analytic processes, tools and products to support those efforts, and acquisition of space systems for the control and exploitation of air and space.</p>
<p>The Development Planning Directorate's Management Operations Division (SMC/XRO) is responsible for supporting SMC/XR in three key areas: Information Management, Human Resources, and Security &amp; Infrastructure.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to provide continued SETA support services for SMC/XRO until a long term follow-on contract vehicle is established. SETA support focuses primarily on Security &amp; Infrastructure capabilities which involve the management of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs); management of the Information Security (INFOSEC), Personnel Security (PERSEC), Industrial Security, Operational Security (OPSEC), Communication Security (COMSEC), Program Protection Planning (PPP), International Affairs, Information Assurance (IA), and Physical Security programs; administration of the Modeling, Simulation &amp; Analysis (MS&amp;A) environment, and video teleconferencing (VTC) system support. All are critical in ensuring a secure environment for future military space capabilities vital to the warfighter.</p>
<p>The total estimated value of this extension is $1.3M and the anticipated PoP is 20 January 2014 to 19 January 2015. This extension will be funded with 3600- Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds.</p>
<p>IV. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AUTHORITY/RATIONAL FOR LIMITING SOURCES</p>
<p>FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than three as required by FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>SMC/XR had reasonably anticipated its requirement would be supported by SMC's new centralized technical support contract vehicle (STS2); however in October 2013, SMC/XR was informed by the Program Management and Integration Directorate (SMC/PI) that STS2 would not be awarded before 20 January 2014, the end of the PoP for Task Order FA8814-11-F-0003. SMC/XR was advised to seek alternatives to support its SMC/XRO program requirements. SMC/XR sought another waiver from SMC/PI to use a decentralized contract vehicle that would meet XR's requirements.</p>
<p>On 20 November 2013, SMC/PI granted SMC/XR a waiver which authorized SMC/XR to establish a contracting mechanism outside STS2. Consequently, the SMC/PI waiver authorized SMC/XR to extend the PoP for the current task order an additional twelve months, through 20 January 2015. Extending the PoP for a period not to exceed twelve months would allow support for SMC/XR's mission until STS2 is awarded. STS2 is expected to be awarded in December 2014.</p>
<p>The nature of this extension is urgent and compelling. Given the status of STS2 and Task Order FA8814-11-F-0003's end date of 20 January 2014, SMC/XR faces a break in service if this extension is not executed. Upon approval to seek an alternative contracting mechanism, The Contracting Officer concluded that an award using competitive FSS ordering procedures would not produce an award before the end of the PoP, as the process to do so takes 4-6 months. A competition would yield an unacceptable delay of 2-4 months in service. This would result in a significant loss of manpower. The SMC/XRO functions include tasks that are critical to the program and a shortfall of manpower of this extent would be considered damaging to the Government.<br />SMC/XRO presently has seven Government civilian positions within the Security &amp; Infrastructure Branch, but due to the Fiscal Year (FY) 14 civilian workforce shaping initiatives, two currently vacant Government civilian positions will not be filled. Therefore, SMC/XRO's personnel consist of only five and their tasks are divided as follows: One Government civilian is responsible for the PERSEC, OPSEC, PPP and International Affairs programs. One Government civilian is responsible for the Infrastructure programs which include IA, VTC, and MS&amp;A. One Government civilian is responsible for the COMSEC program. One Government civilian is responsible for the INFOSEC and Industrial Security programs. One Government civilian is responsible for the SCI/SCIF management and Physical Security program as well as being the Branch Chief. Of note, one of the five Government civilians telecommutes three days a week. Additionally, there are two of the five Government civilians, who serve in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces; who are subject to mobilization for any length of time. One of them is projected to be absent in excess of 90 days, not including contingencies, to meet mission requirements. Currently, there are seven contractors who are assigned to specific capabilities as well, each providing support to a particular Government civilian. <br />The complete loss of contractor manpower due to a break in service would effectively overburden the five Government civilians. The result would be single points of failure leading to a degraded state of support for the SMC/XR mission and adversely impacting SMC/XRO's ability to protect and sustain SMC/XR assets. Any interruption in services obtained under the current Task Order will introduce unacceptable risks to SMC/XR mission capability and effectiveness, immediately jeopardizing the success of essential and time-sensitive SMC/XR projects/programs. Specific mission impacts are provided below:<br />1. SMC/XR will lose the ability to effectively and efficiently manage all three of the Directorate's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs), and the sensitive information contained inside because there are too few Government personnel to perform mandatory DoD and DIA administration activities. These activities include performing monthly security inspections, screening of personnel before entry of classified meetings, maintain separate administrative files of each facility, escorting uncleared personnel, SCI billet roster nomination and maintenance, and liaison for NRO Co-Use/Joint-Use within the SCIF. The elimination of Government positions and inadequate training opportunities due to fiscal constraints has resulted in the inability of non-contractor personnel to adequately perform these functions. This will restrict access into the SCIFs, delaying on-going classified studies and analysis activities until services are resumed. It will also overwhelm the current security staff, forcing the delay of other critical activities indefinitely, and ultimately leading to a compromise of SCI.<br />2. SMC/XR will be unable to perform daily DoD, DIA, Air Force, and SMC Information Security policy enforcement activities. SMC/XR would lose the ability to monitor and enforce sensitive and classified information management and protection and document destruction polices as well as lose the capability to perform daily SCI inventories of classified facilities and containers. Staffing limitations, in addition to permanent reductions in force/training sequestration impacts, will force the restriction of critical reporting tasks jeopardizing the security of the Directorate controlled DoD information.<br />3. SMC/XR will be unable to perform daily Personnel Security activities such as personnel in-processing, establish clearances for visiting personnel, process Common Access Cards, Automated Entry Controlled Cards, and process employment terminations or relocations. The extensive delays will severely degrade the ability of SMC/XR personnel to perform their assigned tasks..<br />4. SMC/XR will be forced to suspend regulatory Program Protection Plan development and execution for on-going SMC/XR programs and projects crucial in the planning of future space capabilities, including underlying technology developments, mission area architectures and roadmaps, technology/concept demonstrations/projects, as well as no longer being able to use contractor acquired and maintained analytic processes/tools/products that support our efforts.<br />5. SMC/XR will experience delays with Industrial Security activities such as assistance and review of DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, verification of cleared facilities and personnel, and the review of classified contracts to identify the level and kind of security required. These delays will negatively impact contracting activities within SMC/XR as the lack of security guidance prevents classified contracts being signed. <br />6. SMC/XR Space Systems (SENSE, HPO, REACH) will be impacted. All systems are required to obtain an Authorization to Operate/Authorization to Connect, annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements, and annual IA controls and risk mitigation reviews. Insufficient Government personnel (.25 FTE) are available to provide knowledge and timely support. Contractor support is needed to provide certification, accreditation expertise, and support to meet DoD 8570.01-M Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program.<br />7. Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&amp;A) Environment to support Systems Engineering, Enterprise Architecting, OPIR AoA, and CPGS project will be impacted. Current infrastructure is not sufficient to support newly identified projects and requires recertification to include new capabilities for these projects. Specialized hardware/software and models need to be integrated into the current infrastructure. Additional classified network capabilities are required to be incorporated into the infrastructure. Current Government manpower (.5 FTE) is not sufficient to provide expertise and meet project timelines. <br />8. The SMC/XR COMSEC program could be jeopardized. Failure to maintain program could cause damage to National Security and failure of a MAJCOM or IG inspection. Government does not have sufficient manpower and expertise to provide required support. COMSEC key material needs proper maintenance in accordance with DoDI 8523.01, DoDI 8560.01, AFI 33-201, AFI 33-211, and AFI 33-275. The contractor provides know-how and expertise to support space system COMSEC integration.<br />9. VTC services are essential communication tools to support the SMC/XR mission. Government personnel do not have technical expertise to provide maintenance, troubleshooting, installation and recertification of VTC systems. Per the SMC/CC's direction, utilization of VTC systems for communication with dispersed attendees is required, bolstering the need for contractor support of SMC/XR VTC systems.<br />Extending the current Task Order by 12 months will enable the SMC/XR to maintain the current level of support without jeopardizing the SMC mission until STS2 is awarded in December 2014. <br />V. DETERMINATION BY THE ORDERING ACTIVITY CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.404(d) GSA rates have been pre-determined as fair and reasonable. The rates were found fair and reasonable by the GSA Contracting Officer. Further discounts will be pursued in accordance with FAR 8.405-4. Additionally there is no indication that the market for the labor categories and expected rates have changed significantly from the time of the current Task Order award, which was competitively awarded and received discounted rates. In the meantime, new DoD, SMC and AF directives have consolidated requirements for qualified personnel, and the current contractor is highly motivated to maintain competitive pricing for this contract. The Contracting Officer will perform a price reasonableness determination as part of the best value determination.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMOUNG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>This requirement is a follow-on that is anticipated to be supported by STS2 upon award. Given the competitive nature of the follow-on STS2 contract, it is known that there are others in the marketplace who can accomplish this work, just not in the timeframe required for this effort. Conducting a competition and an anticipated 6 month transition period necessary to get a new contractor up to speed to perform the stated requirements, would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Government's requirements. As such, no further market research was conducted."</p>
<p>VII. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>VIII. ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES</p>
<p>The Developmental Planning Directorate is in the process of identifying additional requirements which would need to be competed for the follow-on contract. The Directorate is merging with another Directorate to create the Advanced Concept Directorate (SMC/AD). All SMC/AD follow on requirements will be competitively awarded utilizing the SMC Technical Support II (STS-2) contract. An RFQ is anticipated to be released in late 2014 with an anticipated task order award date of December 2014.</p>
<p>XI. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidence that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>X. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by the Program Manager's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>
<p>IX. FOR JUSTIFICATION UNDER FAR 8.405-6(a)(1), A WRITTEN DETERMINATION BY THE APPROVING OFFICIAL IDENTIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT APPLIES</p>
<p>This limited source justification document serves as the written determination documenting the circumstances that apply under FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A).</p>

REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE:<br />Requiring Agency: JITC, 2001 Brainard Road, Building 57305, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85670.<br />Contracting Office: DISA/DITCO/PL8315, 2001 Brainard Road, Building 57305, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85670.<br /><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S):<br />(a) The nature of this action is to modify the cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) task order (TO) against the T&amp;E MSS IDIQ contract, held by ManTech, a large business, in order to increase the level of effort. The increased level of effort is required to provide for additional support to the STEP system in order to conduct Joint Interoperable testing.<br />(b) Fiscal Year 2014 funds are provided for the procurement under the Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request number DJTMZ40232. The estimated increase of this action is $46,025.00, increasing the TO from $47,042.00 to $93,066.00.<br /><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:<br />a. This modification to the task order will add additional critical test resource requirements to support the testing window and additional TDY travel requirements not foreseen/anticipated at time of task order award. JITC requires the additional effort in order to collect data on the full extent of system interfaces, to support a full system joint interoperability recertification decision. The scope of the TO will be increased to encompass the additional test systems support and TDY<br />Reference Number: HC1028-12-D-0026-0083<br />Title of Effort: STEP DICE 14 test J&amp;A<br />Page 2 of 6<br />required. Overtime has also been approved for supporting extended test hours as needed. Additional supporting systems have been made available for this test event, requiring additional data collectors at remote sites. This will require additional effort to support the required additional TDY.<br />b. The period of performance (PoP) for this task order remains unchanged at September 16, 2013 - September 15, 2014, with an option period of September 16, 2014 -September 15, 2015.<br />c. JITC certified the STEP for joint interoperability in 2010. The PM requested a recertification based on updates made to the system. During planning, more systems were made available to test the STEP joint interfaces. The full extent of requirements should now be assessed during the DICE 2014 event, during January 27, February 14, 2014. Unforeseen test resources in the original planning have resulted in the government requiring an increase for this effort. There is a continued need for this requirement to meet the system test schedule and support future system development.<br /><br />4. SUPPORTING RATIONALE, INCLUDING A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY:<br />a. Exception to Fair Opportunity. The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.<br />b. Description of the Justification: This testing is a critical portion of the Joint Interoperability Testing for this system to support the full recertification of the system. Based on the current Government investment and the required timeline, MacTech is the only contractor capable of meeting this requirement.<br />c. Justification:<br />(1) Minimum Government requirements. Data Collectors must possess a Secret clearance and be trained in Joint Interoperability Certification testing. They must also be knowledgeable about the STEP multiple sub-systems, tactical communication system architecture and interface, and have a comprehensive understanding of the STEP Information Support Plan. Data Collectors must be able to support the test start date of January 27, 2014.<br />(2) Proposed sole source contractor. ManTech received the award of the existing task order HC1028-12-D-0026-0083 through fair opportunity under the T&amp;E MSS contract. The ManTech team has spent 5 months preparing for this test event, and coordinating test resources. Their experience with this system and the work and investments made to date makes them the only choice for providing data collectors that can work under their direction. The approximate cost increase for this J&amp;A to support this test would still exist, as it is primarily the TDY costs for Per Diem, travel, and the actual testing hours on site as well as the overtime test support at JITC. Discussion regarding cause of the sole source situation. As stated above, this modification is a<br /><br />Reference Number: HC1028-12-D-0026-0083<br />Title of Effort: STEP DICE 14 test J&amp;A<br />Page 3 of 6<br />logical follow-on to work already under contract. Holding a separate fair opportunity competition simply to increase the level of effort for the exact work already under contract would result in the needless substantial duplication of cost and other resources as well as possible mission degradation due to the time delay. The additional delays may result in the DISA system losing system certification and could significantly degrade the DISA supported communications missions across the gateway. Thus, ManTech is the only contractor that can meet the requirements in the required timeframe and without the loss of the investments received to date.<br />(3) Demonstration of unique source. In addition to the loss of what is already invested in this testing, ManTech is poised and staffed with the appropriate personnel to continue work upon award. ManTech possesses the intimate knowledge and experience with the STEP/Tactical environment to be productive from day one. The nature of the task requires a contractor with working knowledge, which ManTech is currently demonstrating, of the STEP and tactical system technical architectures, business process and service organizations, as well as the automated test tools, to effectively evaluate, design, develop and rapidly deploy test capabilities.<br />(4) Procurement discussion. ManTech has provided support for the STEP testing during the current HC1028-12-D-0026-0002. In order to accomplish the scheduled Joint Interoperability Certification on time, ManTech is the only contractor to perform this action. ManTech has the knowledge, experience and skills to provide the technical and policy support within the timeframes established by JITC. ManTech possesses the intimate knowledge and experience with the STEP testing environment to be productive from day one.<br />(5) Impact. A delay in testing would result in the DISA PM having a significant cost increase for planning a test event outside of DICE. The funding that JITC DICE has already provided for SATCOM resources and test bed support would also be lost. There are USMC, JCSE, and AF resources that have also come online to support this event. It is unknown when we could reschedule an event with these resources. Continued continuity and timely supply of data collectors is critical to the success of this recertification in support of DISA STEP. The additional delays may result in the DISA system losing system certification and may significantly degrade the DISA supported communications missions. Additionally, if a different contractor were to provide this service the continuity of testing would be lost, critical time would be lost, and additional funds would be expended to bring a new contractor up to speed on the program and the test approach.<br /><br />5. COST/PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION:<br />By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in FAR 16.505, the government can conclude that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the government's needs. Rates have been established within the basic contract. All rates set forth in the contract, and used on individual task orders, were based on full and open competition and a price analysis was accomplished. Proposed task order rates and loadings will be compared with the basic contract rates and loadings and verified as fair and reasonable.<br />6. MARKET RESEARCH:<br /><br />Reference Number: HC1028-12-D-0026-0083<br />Title of Effort: STEP DICE 14 test J&amp;A<br />Page 4 of 6<br />a. In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted for this acquisition. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) conducted market research in September 2013. Market research conducted by the COR included a review of acquisition history, a review of possible competitors, and a review of source lists for identical or similar items obtained from Government, professional, and/or industry sources.<br />b. The original TO was awarded to ManTech and during that award process it was already determined that the rates for services offered are fair and reasonable. These same rates will be used. Award to any other contractor would cause significant delay to the required testing due to the specialized experience required in order to be able to fulfill this TO, as well as loss of the Government's current investment. This method represents the best value to the Government.<br /><br />7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: None.<br /><br />8. ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY, FAR:<br />a.
