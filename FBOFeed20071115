<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement for enhanced protection to the personnel working underground at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine.  This will be partially accomplished through the installation of a tunnel liner with backfill to the mine roof and ribs (walls).  This tunnel liner will extend 640 ft into an alternate escapeway from just outside a portal.  The tunnel liner will provide permanent support irrespective of future stability issues or developments and will meet the requirements of preserving the facility for future research needs.  Enhanced personnel protection from roof falls and the long-term viability of the mine will also be accomplished through the installation of rock and cable bolts and meshing across the mine roof and partially down each rib/pillar (wall) and through the application of shotcrete in other needed sections of both escapeways.  The magnitude of the requirement, in terms of an estimated price range, is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000.

This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition - unrestricted basis.

The CDC intends to award a single Design-Build Construction / Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The design portion of the requirement is to be completed within 60 calendar days after contract award (excluding the number of days allotted for Government review and approvals).  The construction portion of the requirement is to be completed within 150 calendar days after the Government issues a Notice To Proceed.  

The complete solicitation document and reference material will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 04 DEC 2007.  No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.

It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site.

An organized site visit has been scheduled for 11 DEC 2007 at 10:00 am local time.  Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed at this time.  Participants will meet at Lake Lynn Laboratory, 2546 Springhill Furnace Road (Route 857), Lake Lynn, PA  15451.  Upon entering the facility, next to the Lake Lynn Laboratory sign, visitors should be safety conscious of heavy equipment traffic on lanes shared with an adjacent active mine.  Follow NIOSH signs to a security gate and contact Government personnel to proceed by use of the intercom.  Follow visitor signs to the main office building for sign-in.  The following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to be worn while inside of the mine: steel toe safety shoes, hard hat, mine belt, safety glasses, W65 self-rescuer or equivalent, cap lamp or flashlight.  It is recommended that attendees provide their own PPE due to limited quantities available for use during the site visit from the Government.  Appropriate clothing is also recommended for temperature conditions between 55-60 degrees (can be much colder dependent on outside temperatures near the entry and portal area).  Attendee-provided spotlights will enhance viewing of the mine roof in the tunnel liner area.  Non-U.S. Citizens must be cleared in advance of attendance.  Such individuals should email the point of contact identified within this announcement by no later than 12:00 PM EST on 29 NOV 2007 to provide the Government sufficient time to process the security clearance.  Only email requests will be honored.  Email requests should include the following for each Non-U.S. Citizen attendee: visitor's full official name, gender, date of birth, place of birth (city, providence, state, country), country of citizenship, passport type and number, date of passport expiration, permanent resident number if the visitor is a permanent U.S. resident, type of visa with issue and expiration dates if the visitor is currently in the U.S., visitor's organization, visitor's position and title within the organization, visitor's organization address, visitor's organization telephone number, visitor's email address, visitor's residency address.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), in coordination with the US Geological Survey (USGS), anticipates the issuance of a solicitation for a competitive small business set-aside for the procurement of the LDCM Mission Operations Element (MOE), in support of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) Project.	It is also anticipated that a Draft Request for Proposals (DRFP) will be posted on or about December 3, 2007, with comments due not later than nine calendar days after release.  The functions of the MOE are mission planning and scheduling (not to include long-term and daily image collection planning and prioritization); telemetry, command and control; mission health and status monitoring and analysis; on-board memory management; and flight dynamics capabilities.	The proposed contract would be for the design, development, integration, testing, delivery, and installation of the MOE, support for ground system and mission-level integration and test, support of operations readiness activities, engineering support during the launch and early-orbit period, and a period of sustaining engineering.   The MOE must meet the requirements of all of the MOE technical documents such as the MOE Requirements Document. It is anticipated that the majority of the contract shall be performed at the selected contractor's facility. The first 42 months of the resultant contract will be Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) for the MOE development, and the following 60 months of the basic contract period will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for post-launch sustaining engineering.  It is anticipated that the basic contract period of performance will be approximately 8.5 years with five, 1-year CPFF options for sustaining engineering following the basic contract.   NASA/GSFC will host an informational meeting for prospective offerors on December 11, 2007 at the Marriott-Greenbelt, 6400 Ivy Lane, in Greenbelt, MD (see the LDCM web site for details, http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov/      ). Due to the fact that International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)-sensitive information will be presented at this meeting, attendance is limited to U.S. Persons.  Time will be set aside for NASA/GSFC discussions with the prime contractors and their subcontractors. There will not be separate discussions with subcontractors. Appointments for discussions will be up to 45 minutes in duration and must be scheduled in advance with the LDCM MOE Contracting Officer (see point of contact below).  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.	See Note 1. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541512 and $23M, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51		 Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The consultation services are necessary so that the Service can quantify avian injuries resulting from the oil spill and identify appropriate primary and/or compensatory restoration activities. This natural resource damage assessment effort is related to the grounding of the 738-foot cargo vessel M/V Selendang Ayu, off Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands. The vessel, carrying approximately 483,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel oil and 21,000 gallons of diesel fuel, ran aground and broke apart December 2004.  The number of bird carcasses recovered during an oil spill response typically represents only a subset of the total mortality. Many of the birds that are killed by an oil spill are not recovered due to predation, wave action, difficulties in detection, and some of the bird carcasses that are recovered may not have been attributable to the spill.  Estimating the total mortality involves correcting for factors that result in carcass disappearance before being recovered by researchers and estimating the rate at which carcasses are deposited in the absence of an oil spill. During the pre-assessment phase of the case, R.G. Ford Consulting assisted the Service and other trustees in compiling and analyzing information gathered during response and pre-assessment activities to estimate background seabird mortality, searcher efficiency, and scavenging rates.  The contract which will be awarded following this sole source synopsis shall include R.G. Ford Consulting using data and pre-assessment estimates from the preassessment phase of investigation to advise the Service regarding the development of an overall estimate of total mortality for avian species.  Under the direction of the Service, RG Ford Consultantswill participate in cooperative negotiations with the responsible party to resolve disputes over specific assumptions in developing the mortality estimate.  RG Ford Consultants will generate a final written report after the negotiations are concluded that contains the following: a) Name and address of the client b) Name and address of the analysts c) Description of the underlying assumptions and methods used to quantify seabird mortality d) Summary of results and conclusions This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made approximately 30 days following the publication of this notice, on or shortly after November 16, 2007.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) has a need to design, develop, and test software enhancement to the Adaptive Control Software (ACS) Lite version. This software controls roadway traffic control signals, and was previously developed for the FHWA under another contract. The software was designed to operate in existing closed loop systems, with traffic signal systems form all four NEMA signal vendors. The control algorithms consist of split and off set optimization routines that operate in a near real time. FHWA will supply the source code, executable API's, and the software documentation applicable to all four versions of the existing ACS Lite software. Upon award, the contractor will assemble all enhancements in a complete package and then lab test the enhanced software in a hardware-in-the-loop setting with real field masters and controllers for each version. This contract will provide a mechanism whereby FHWA can advance the ACS Lite program from state-of-the-art technology to state-of-the-practice technology, that can later be deployed throughout the highway transportation community.

The advantages of this procedure are that it will allow the NIA/CMS to reduce the number of animals needing to be maintained, while at the same time keeping a wider variety of strains safe and available for research purposes whenever needed.  The NIA/CMS is scheduled to move into a new building beginning in January 2008.  Cryopreserving mice before the move would eliminate the chance of losing a strain due to unforeseen technical problems or accidents with the move.  It would also reduce the numbers of mice needing to be moved, making the move itself less complex and less likely to result in a break in biosecurity. The Jackson Laboratory will send a team of three scientists to harvest sperm from mice in 25 strains.  The sperm will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in three geographically distinct facilities for a period of three years.  Jackson will also check to see that the procedure was successful by recovering mice from a portion of the stored sample.  Following the on-site visit, additional strains may be sent to the Jackson Laboratory via courier.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).   The cited authority is applicable because Jackson Laboratory is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.   The Jackson Laboratory is a nonprofit organization dedicated to research.  They have developed a proprietary sperm cryopreservation and recovery system which is less expensive than traditional embryo methods and offers greater versatility.  Due to technical barriers, no other company has successfully achieved the recovery of the breadth of strains from sperm cryopreservation that Jackson Laboratory has provided data on including: BALBc, BL6, 129substrains.  Jackson has successfully cryopreserved and recovered more than 400 hundred strains.  The Jackson Laboratory stores 16 straws of sperm in three tanks in two different locations.  An exhaustive search of Internet resources and conversations with other scientists at NIH did not reveal other vendors capable of supplying this type of service.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price technically acceptable.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 112990 and the size standard is $.075.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services.  The DSC does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria for contemporary/historic architecture and landscape architecture, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	Demonstrated ability, experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract,  (i.e., knowledge of indigenous cultures and practices, vernacular architectural styles, historical construction methods, sustainable design, natural resources processes and sensitivities, Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), etc.) in various climatic regions for the geographic area covered by this solicitation. Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs. 2.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to award a sole-source extension to Ricoh Americas Corporation (Ricoh) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of the Technical Information and Management Services Branch.  This procurement is to extend the current delivery orders under Contract NAS5-01125 from December 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 to allow for completion of the phase-in transition period. The NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) awarded the follow-on contract, an agency-wide multifunctional device (MFD) services contract, to Xerox Corporation effective May 1, 2007 with a 150-day phase-in period from the date of award.  The delivery orders were extended through November 30, 2007 to allow for the continuity of services as well as the completion of the phase-in and phase-out period of the successor and incumbent contractor, respectively.  It was anticipated that the phase-in and phase-out activities would be completed by November 30, 2007.  However, the NSSC notified NASA's GSFC that an extension is necessary for NASA Headquarters. The continued tight coordination between Ricoh, Xerox and the Government is critical in an effort to avoid an interruption in service.	Due to the necessary phase-in period, Ricoh is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA/GSFC's needs given the magnitude of the effort and the short period of performance of the extension. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>99 -- PORTABLE CSAR INTERROGATOR UNIT
<SOLNBR>R1718
<CONTACT>Stephen Martenz stephen.martenz@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>1.  The Electronic Systems Center (ESC) 753d Electronic Systems Group (ELSG) manages the follow-on development, production and sustainment of the Joint Service Combat Survivor Evader Locator (CSEL) System.  This is a dedicated survival communication system that provides Over-the-Horizon secure two-way data transmission and Line-of-Sight (LOS) non secure voice.  The 753 ELSG is currently expanding this to include secure text data transmission between the survivor and the rescue force. 2.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the USAF or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. 3.  This Pre-solicitation Notice is part of a Government market research effort to determine industry capabilities to develop, test, and produce a hand held interrogator unit that can be used by rescue forces on the ground and in the air.  Development is expected to begin in mid FY08 and extend at least through FY09, with an expectation of approximately 20 interrogator prototype units.  Subsequently, the Government has a requirement to procure up to 200 interrogator units and will likely add follow-on procurement options.  The hand held interrogator unit at minimum shall meet the following listed requirements:   (a) The interrogator shall communicate with the AN/PRQ-7 CSEL Hand Held Radio and the PRC-112G CSAR Transceiver (referred to as the CSEL HHR and PRC-112 respectively throughout this document). (b) Rescue forces using an interrogator shall be able to send both pre-formatted and free text messages to the isolated personnel (IPs).  The required capacity for two-way secure LOS data communications is 25 IPs, with storage for up to 25 pre-formatted interrogation statements, and up to 200 received or transmitted messages. (c) The interrogator shall be highly reliable and include a Built-in-Test (BIT) capability to quickly ascertain proper operation. (d) The interrogator shall incorporate the appropriate security schema applicable to the PRC-112 (Commercial Encryption) and to the CSEL HHR (NSA tested and approved encryption). (e) For airborne operations, the contractor shall propose a means to secure the interrogator to the pilot's leg for both in-flight use and during ejection.  The interrogator design will allow for operations with the various UHF/Inter-communication systems (ICS) that exist on Service aircraft that support the Personnel Recovery On-Scene Commander (PR OSC) and rescue vehicle function.  The interrogator must allow the normally used headset to simultaneously connect to the same communications port (connector) and share the selected radio for LOS audio voice or interrogator LOS data communications.  The interrogator must be capable of being connected quickly to the aircrew ICS communication cords and must not injure or hinder the aircrew, or hinder the operation of the ejection seat during normal or emergency operation; the design needs to meet current standards for certification as safe to fly. (f) The interrogator size and volume should not exceed 32 oz and 38 cubic inches with its self-contained power source, not including its cable assembly.  The objective length is under 7.5in, max width of 3.6in at the display, and max thickness of 2.5in at the display. (g) For daylight operation, the interrogator shall be viewable in direct sunlight conditions. For night operations the interrogator shall be viewable with and without Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). (h) The interrogator will not draw power from the aircraft electrical system, and as such, a battery life of 8 hours is needed. (i) The environmental requirements include interior cockpit operations, and exterior blowing rain, salt water immersion, snow, ice, dust and mud.  (j) The interrogator must incorporate a serial interface for upload and download of mission data, cryptographic key material and be capable of upgrading software. (k) The interrogator must have a two action zeroize capability that clears all mission data and cryptographic material stored in the interrogator.  The interrogator will notify the user of zeroization at first action and upon confirmation (second action), display 'zeroized' after all data and keys are purged. (l) The interrogator will protect classified IP data received from a non-approved COMSEC device to the extent practical.  Rescue force to rescue force two-way exchange of mission or IP data must be accomplished using the secure cryptographic architecture approved by NSA. (m) The interrogator must be electromagnetically compatible within itself and with other systems in the operational environment.  It shall not be operationally degraded or fail due to exposure to electromagnetic environmental effects, such as electromagnetic and radio frequency interference.  4.  Please provide formal responses to the tasks listed below.  Address your capabilities to accomplish the tasks and provide highlights of successful past experience on similar government contracts within the past 5 years.  (a) Describe your capability to develop and manufacture an interrogator that meets  the listed requirements described in Paragraph 3. (b) Describe your intended strategy to obtain the CSEL and PRC-112 specific waveform data, documentation, and general purpose rights to facilitate the development, production, and fielding of an interrogator that communicates with the CSEL HHR and PRC-112.  Assume that the CSEL waveform will be provided in a draft CSEL Waveform Specification.  The draft CSEL Waveform Description Specification document will be available to respondents upon request.  For reference, waveforms are described per the attached document, "Interrogator Waveform Description".   (c) Describe your intended testing strategy for the interrogator to include Joint safety of flight certification, flight qualification, and environmental testing. (d) Describe your capability to develop and conduct interrogator operator and maintenance training course. Training may be conducted at both CONUS and OCONUS sites. (e) The procured interrogator units will include at least a 1 year warranty and an option for Interim Contractor Support for repair and spares.  Describe your experience implementing this type of logistics. (f) What is your estimated ramp-up time from contract award to first article test?    5.  Firms will provide their qualifications package electronically via e-mail to Mr. Jeffrey Wong by e-mail at Jeffrey.Wong@hanscom.af.mil with a copy to Captain Stephen Martenz at Stephen.Martenz@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is contracting on behalf of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a general contractor for a new laboratory building (B1E) in Boulder, Colorado.  

The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world.  The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance.   The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to < 3 micrometers/second.  At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices. 

The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST?s most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness.  The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST?s continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. 

The solicitation will be published on or about December 5, 2007, with an award anticipated for the summer of 2008.  The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000 to $80,000,000.  Completion time for this project is estimated at nine hundred (900) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.  All project requirements and submission information will be available electronically and without charge through Fed Biz Opps on or about December 5, 2007.

Source selection will be made using best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1).   The government will not pay for any information solicited.  Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  

All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at 800-234-3867 or on line at 
https://www.dnb.com and click on ?get a D&B D-U-N-S number?.


This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $31 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder area) business concern participation.

<b><u>Trans-Caspian Oil and Gas Pipelines Feasibility Study</u></b>
The State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to determine the technical and economic feasibility of (1) a pipeline that would transport natural gas from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to Europe via Turkey and (2) a pipeline that would transport crude oil from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan.  

It is intended that the on-land portion of the natural gas pipeline be constructed along or within the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline corridor.  The pipeline is to cross the Caspian Sea in the territorial waters of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.  

The Feasibility Study includes tasks to develop net-back prices for anchor gas suppliers in Kazakhstan.  These net-back prices are to be based on European gas purchase prices less transportation costs.  The Feasibility Study contractor shall develop transportation tariffs for the Trans-Caspian Natural Gas Pipeline from Kazakhstan supplier interface points to its terminus point within or at the border of Turkey.  Tariffs from the terminus point of the Trans-Caspian Natural Gas Pipeline to the European point of purchase are to be estimated based on information gathered by the contractor from studies undertaken by transmission system developers, European governments, the TACIS INOGATE Program, the World Bank and other multilateral agencies.

It is intended that the crude oil pipeline parallel the land and sub-Caspian Sea route of the Trans-Caspian Natural Gas Pipeline described above.

The Feasibility Study includes tasks to develop the design and total installed cost of the Trans-Caspian Crude Oil Pipeline as well as develop the economics, tariffs and potential environmental impacts of such a system.  The design basis shall be two million barrels per day of Kazakhstan crude oil unless otherwise guided by the Kazakhstan oil producers and /or the BTC operators.

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study includes:

Task A - Determine Exportable Oil and Gas from Regional Producers;
Task B - Determine Shore Crossings & Route for Sub-Sea Portion of the Pipelines;
Task C - Prepare Preliminary Designs;
Task D - Prepare Capital and Operating Cost Estimates;
Task E - Prepare Pipeline Economic Models and Estimate Developmental Impact;
Task F - Review Transmission and Market Studies for Gas Pipelines from Turkey to Europe;
Task G - Prepare Natural Gas Net-Back Estimates for Anchor Producers;
Task H - Project Execution Strategy;
Task I - Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment; and
Task J - Deliverables and Reporting.
  
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,700,000 grant to SOCAR from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<u><b>Jordan: Feasibility Study: Zarqa River Basin Wastewater and Solid Waste Treatment Project</u></b> 
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the wastewater collection and treatment systems in the Zarqa River Basin, determine the needs, and conduct financial feasibility analyses for the needed investment.  

The Zarqa River is the third largest river in Jordan.  It flows through four governorates; Amman, Zarqa, Jerash, and Mafraq, which have 8, 7, 18, and 5 municipalities, respectively, with each municipality containing several communities.  The catchment area of the Zarqa River is the most densely populated area in Jordan, comprising approximately 65% of the country's population and more than 85% of its industries.

The main two sources of wastewater pollution in the Zarqa River Basin are industrial and domestic wastewater.  The Zarqa River Basin is home to more than 90% of the small to medium scale industries in Jordan, although some of the largest industries in Jordan also operate in Zarqa.  Some industries dispose of their untreated wastewater into the municipal sanitary network.  Although wastewater must meet the quality requirements of Jordanian Standard Specifications 202 for the discharge of industrial and commercial wastewater to the sanitary network, some industries violate national standards and discharge polluted wastewater into the sanitary network.  Other industries dispose of their untreated wastewater in adjacent wadis (dry riverbeds), often by using tanker trucks.

Restoration of the Zarqa River Basin is a primary concern of the Government of Jordan.  As part of its efforts in this regard, the Jordanian Ministry of Environment (MoE) has been given the responsibility of conducting a national workshop comprising all stakeholders to deal with the restoration issue in an integrated manner.  The Project is a major component of the MoE?s plan for restoration of the Zarqa River Basin.

The Jordanian Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, acting through the MoE, would serve as the Grantee for this activity.

The Terms of reference for this Feasibility Study are as follows:

Task 1: Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2: Review of Existing Conditions
Task 3: Demand Analysis and Projections
Task 4: Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment
Task 5: Review Jordanian Environmental Legislation
Task 6: Economic, Financial and Socio-economic Analysis of the Project
Task 7: Development Impact Assessment
Task 8: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $335,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Dana Altmon-Cary, (757) 878-0103
<DESC>This synopsis is for a noncommercial program entitled A-160 Flight Readiness and Envelope Expansion.  The objectives of this program are to expand the flight envelope and characterize the performance of the A-160 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL),  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); to determine and demonstrate the benefits and limitations of the Optimum Speed Rotor (OSR) with respect to range, endurance and noise propagation; characterize the helicopter system design accommodations necessary for integr ation of an OSR; identify and improve flight control deficiencies associated with this unique system; and improve the overall reliability and durability of the A-160. The system is expected to demonstrate endurance of 18-20 hours of continuous flight, flig ht above 20,000 feet and a payload capacity up to 1000 lbs.  Focus of the characterization will be the Optimum Speed Rotor which is the primary enabling technology. The contractor shall provide flight testing, capability demonstrations, design studies, ana lysis, engineering support, aircraft modification, subsystem integration, maintenance, repair, and efforts to improve aircraft reliability and durability.  A sole source award per 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no othe r supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements of A-160 Flight Readiness and Envelope Expansion.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a contract ma ximum of $30 million.  Orders will be issued on a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) basis.  The sole source IDIQ award to The Boeing Company has a contract minimum of $3,000,000.  The Boeing Company is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement without a substantial duplication of cost and schedule.  Operation, modification, and system integration of this prototype aircraft requires expert knowledge specific to the A-160 UAV, the details of which are not available to the Government to foster competition.  This acquisition will be conducted pursuant to the terms of FAR Parts 6 and 15.  Market research has identified Boeing as the only helicopter manufacturer with knowledge, experience and aircraft design that incorporates t he concept into a current, flying prototype. Boeing has sole access to the intellectual property of the A-160 detailed design information and is the only source for system trouble-shooting, software debugging, replacement parts and system modification that  will be required to further characterize the performance of the A-160.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to The Boeing Company.  The contract terms and conditions will be developed jointly between the Government and The Boeing Company consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the FAR.  The ordering period for this IDIQ is thirty-six (36) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541712.  While the Govern ment does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, ATTN:  AMSRD-AMR-AA-C Dana Altmon-Cary, Bldg. 401 Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577. Ms. A ltmon-Carys telephone number is 757.878.0103.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Lisa Bucci, Contract Specialist, 617-494-3124
<DESC>This Amendment A001 to the Solicitation DTRT57-08-R-20003, is effective November 15, 2007:  (a.) The following answers/clarifications are provided for informational purposes only, and are in response to questions received from potential offerors:  Question 1: In relation to Solicitation No. DTRT57-08-R-20003, the NAICS Code is 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, and the Small Business size standard is 1,500 employees.  Is there a possibility to act as a primary contractor, and then sub-contract the work out to another company that meets this size standard? Answer 1: As stated in the solicitation, any questions relating to small business size standards should be directed to the Small Business Administration.  Yes, it is possible to act as a large business prime contractor and subcontract some of the work to another company that meets the size standard for a small business; in that case, the size standard of the awardee would be a large business concern. Question 2: Why is the Period of Performance for CLINS 0001 through 0003 for only five (5) months and for CLINS 0004 through 0006 for only six (6) months (i.e., as opposed to a full year)?  Answer 2: The periods of performance stated in the solicitation for CLINs 0001 through 0006 are correct as stated, and were determined to be the performance periods that would cover the Agency's need.  Question 3:  I am wondering if you have any information on the Contract DTRS5705C10007, made Oct. 01 2004 and if you know anything about future telecom procurements.  I am also wondering if Volpe plans to use a vehicle such as NETWORX to procure telecom services. Answer 3:  The referenced Contract is not the subject of this procurement, and a request for information on this contract would need to be submitted separately under the Freedom of Information Act. We have no information available at this time regarding future telecom services procurements. Question 4: The Solicitation reads: [CONTRACTOR TASKS: TASK 1. REMOTE EQUIPMENT MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE A 24X7X365 REMOTE SWITCH MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE CAPABILITY FOR ALL EQUIPMENT]   We assume that [all equipment] pertains only to the Alcatel PBX system and accompanying digital phone sets? Please clarify. Answer 4:  Task 1 refers to monitoring and maintenance for all the telephone equipment and services provided in CLINs 0001 through 0006 of this contract.  Maintenance of the Local Area Network (LAN) cabling from the telephone closets to the LAN jacks as stated in CLIN 0002, will be the responsibility of the Contractor awarded this Contract.  The LAN monitoring of computers, routers, and other non-telephone system devices on the LAN network will be handled through a separate contract.      Question 5:  We would like to provide the U.S. Department of Transportation with an Accurate Pricing Bid/Response for the Maintenance Cost of the Alcatel OMNI4400 PBX.  Does the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center have any or kept any Maintenance Statistics for the Past year or Previous years on the Number of Service Calls  where a Technician had to be Dispatched & Work On Site  for a Minor or Major System Failure ? If you have these Statistics could you please provide them to us.  Answer 5: The requested statistics are not available at this time.

North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS): 561730.  Small Business Size Standard: $6,500,000.00.

The Government contemplates issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Firm Fixed Price Requirements type contract.  This solicitation shall be a 100% set-aside for SBA certified 8(a) concerns.  Evaluation of offers shall be based upon a Price-Past Performance Trade-Off (PPTO) evaluation factors with past performance being significantly more important than price.  Services shall be procured pursuant to the FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The expected award shall consist of one base period of performance (1 February 2008 through 31 January 2009) and may include up to four optional periods of performance (each 1 year in duration from 1 February and ending 31 January of each consecutive period of performance).  There is no guarantee that any optional periods of performance may be exercised.

The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the Performance Work Statement, the Department of Labor Wage Determination and the Past and Present Performance Questionnaire, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 16 November 2007, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each subsequent amendment, if any.

All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

See the following website for information on Map Modernization at:  http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/fhm/mm_main.shtm

Region VIII covers the following states: (Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and Utah).  In addition to work within this region, FEMA may award tasks to a contractor that requires performance outside of this geographical area.

<CONTACT>Andy Leighty, 937-255-2930
<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: ?	Program name ?	Government or contractor POC ?	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. ?	Date & period of performance ?	Cost of effort ?	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we?re looking for ways to implement a ?throttle?  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007. The 677 AESG/TS status brief on the C-17 Training Systems Sustainment  Re-Compete, scheduled for 28 Nov 07 at I/ITSEC in Orlando, has been  cancelled. Modifications: 1. Added additional information to Pre-Solicitation notice 2. Uploaded Industry Day notice available on PIXS 3. Changed the POC from Norma Weikert to Andy Leighty 4.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) extends the closing date of the BAA to 30 Sep 2011; (b) adds a FY 11 recommended date for white papers; (c) increases the total funding; (d) changes the funding profile; (e) updates ombudsman information; and (f) updates AFRL office symbols.  No other changes have been made. 

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 07 should be submitted by 8 Dec 2006; FY 08 by 31 Aug 2007; FY 09 by 31 Aug 2008; FY 10 by 31 Aug 2009; and FY 11 by 31 Aug 2010.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is a world recognized leader in the development of moving target tracking and Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) fusion algorithms.

AFRL/RI has established an in-house Fusion Laboratory for the testing, evaluation and development of Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms.  The state-of-the-art laboratory hosts an array of current up-to-date sensor simulations and a large repository of collected real world intelligence data available for use in algorithm development and evaluation.  In the past the laboratory has been used in the evaluation of a number of contractor and government developed tracking and fusion algorithms.  Algorithms are evaluated using a set of metrics developed by AFRL and their contractor partners.  This set of metrics has become the community standard for testing of tracking and fusion algorithms.  The laboratory is also used for the analysis of operational data to identify recurring patterns that can be used in the exploitation of intelligence data.

Through the evaluation of current state-of-the-art Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms, AFRL/RI has determined that new methods of data association must be developed to meet the tracking and fusion requirements of the operational community.  Lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (>3 targets per sensor resolution cell) result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms.  AFRL/RI believes that augmenting traditional Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms in difficult tracking environments shows promise to increase the tracking performance in difficult situations.  Technologies the laboratory is interested in developing and evaluating for this problem include knowledge based reasoning and learning, abductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques.

Objective:  The objective of this effort is to investigate and evaluate multiple reasoning, knowledge based, and heuristic algorithms against the temporal and spatial association challenges.  Work will include implementation and testing of complete systems, encompassing underlying technologies such as knowledge representation and learning techniques required to provide robust performance.  Data used to perform reasoning and context based association is Multi-INT in nature.  

Research conducted under this program will include application/investigation of knowledge based, reasoning and other heuristic approaches for association.  Other associated technologies required to implement various approaches, such as learning techniques, and knowledge representation and knowledge discovery shall also be considered in scope.  Incremental extensions to target tracking algorithms as well as implementations of new kinematic tracking algorithms will not be considered.

This BAA seeks research efforts that provide innovative technologies supporting new hybrid Multi-INT association algorithms that utilize a reasoning approach to account for large gap times, high density environments and large sensor data inaccuracies.

II.  AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 07 - $500K; FY 08 - $1,300K; FY 09 - $1,275K; FY10 - $1,025K; and FY 11 - $800K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $50,000 to $250,000 per year.   There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

<DESC>The current woodland Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) is used by the AF as a working & field uniform.  The Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) is replacing the BDU.  The lighter color way of the ABU camouflage print (AFDTS) will not hide many potential stains.  Air Force Clothing Office (AFCO) compiled data on stains that are of the biggest concern.  As a result AFCO is seeking information regarding industry available, stain repel-and-release finishes.  This is not a solicitation, and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Government holds the right to test any of the fabrics.  All submissions must be Berry Amendment compliant.  Proposed solutions shall be currently available technologies.  New technologies shall be compatible with all salient characteristics and testing requirements of the base cloth as specified in the purchase description (PD) YACL-05-1 CLOTH TWILL AIR FORCE DIGITAL TIGER STRIPE PRINT CAMOUFLAGE PATTERN, 25 July 2005, plus amendments.

FUNCTIONAL CONCERNS
	Types of stains encountered by the Airmen have a correlation to their functional daily tasks & responsibilities.  In Maintenance functions typical stain types include engine exhaust soot, tire break grime, fuel, deicing fluid, hydraulic fuel, mineral vegetable and ester based oils, and liquid oxygen.  In Field use Airmen reported blood, grass stains, dirt stain, red clay, flare (orange/red), and muddy water as typical.  General staining in everyday ?life? tasks such as eating and drinking are tomato, coffee, soda and juices.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
	AF requests testing results for each product.  For required tests please reference PD and amendments listed above.  Other requirements include effectiveness after exposure to high temperatures in theater, and under rigorous laundering conditions.  Finish should not cause changes in shade, or spectral values a result of application.  Use of Nano technology and other state of the art technologies encouraged.  Any available Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) sheets should also be forwarded.  Since this product will come in close proximity to the skin while in use, proof is required that no potential health issues are posed by the proposed remedy.
	If this fabrication is currently in use please note current applicable industry or military end uses as well as any known positive or negative feedback from current end uses. 
	The USAF would like to keep all current processing the same for the ABU, so that the only changing variable is the addition of stain assistance technology.  This means that we will continue to use the garment dipped process.  As there is some processing that occurs in garment form, this should be taken into consideration when implementing new processes to ensure overall compatibility.  The salient testing characteristics that currently stand should not be reduced by the addition of the new stain process.  We encourage industry partnerships.  If a copy of the cloth or the end item purchase descriptions are needed please e-mail request. 

If needed, request material(s) from a licensed vendor.

<DESC>The Government has procured about 3,000 units in the last 1.5 years.  The expectations are that another 3,500 units are needed between FY08 & FY13 and additional units will be needed thru FY15 (Qty is undefined). The units have been manufactured by a single manufacturer.  The Corps of Engineering requires at least 2 vendors for them to procure an item.  The units will be procured on either a best value or lowest cost basis; unit costs are not expected to exceed $25 0 each. There is an existing drawing to define the required item.  However, we are trying to procure a separate item that meets the form, fit, and function of the original item but may have some differences.  We cannot change the interface connection with the came ra box being supported but can change numerous other items to accommodate a different item.  Suggest interested contractors provide a sketch or draft drawing of any proposed item to meet our required capability.

The Forum, which will be held on November 29, 2007 from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at CMS headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, is designed to educate potential organizations about the federal requirements necessary to become a Medicare QIO contractor. 

Medicare's QIO Program is a key component of CMS' broad agenda to improve care for Medicare Beneficiaries.  CMS contracts with independent organizations (QIOs) to work intensively with providers to improve care. 

The QIO Program's next 3-year contract cycle, the 9th Statement of Work (SOW), begins on August 1, 2008 and will focus on the following four themes:  prevention, patient safety, care transitions (patient pathways) and beneficiary protection.  Each theme consists of a comprehensive set of tasks, roles and responsibilities, progress measures and evaluation.  

To meet the timeframe for the 9th SOW, CMS will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) either in January or February of 2008. The Open Door will provide potential contractors information on the following: 
-	Basic QIO Program history and contract structure
-	High-level 9th SOW content 
-	QIO eligibility requirements and strategies to meet requirements
-	physician sponsorship vs. physician access 
-	QIO governance requirements
-	QIO conflict of interest policies
-	Other opportunities for QIO work (subcontracts, teaming arrangements, etc.)
-	RFP timing and process
-	Answers to questions and opportunity for comment 

More information about the QIO Program (eligibility requirements) may be obtained at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/QualityImprovementOrgs/.   

We look forward to your participation.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability.  This Source Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposals and at this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

Introduction:  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) invites white papers for research and development to support technology applications under this Sources Sought Announcement(SSA)CSC080001115. The administering DTRA program is the Combat Support Contingencies Directorate (CSC). The total number of pages shall not exceed 5 pages to include rough order of magnitude on cost and effort.

Background:  DTRA's mission is to safeguard America and its allies from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives (CBRNE) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat. The objective of this SSA is to acquire scientific, technical, and operational information on the topic area of ordnance detection technology supporting DTRA/CSC.
DTRA is soliciting white papers to integrate selectable passive and non-passive ordnance detection technology into an Ordnance Detector/Mine Probe instrument that is currently made or one that can be easily constructed. The instrument should be light weight, man portable, able to detect and locate ferrous and non ferrous materials as well as solid state electronic components. 
The proposal should include discussions using only proven active and passive detector technologies such as Electro-Magnetic Induction (EMI); Magnetometers; Gradiometers; Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR); and Non-linear Junction Detector (NLJD); etc. Unproven, experimental, or theoretical search technologies will not be considered. The discussion should include only the technologies that would be required to search and locate ferrous and non-ferrous materials and solid state electronic components. The instrument should be capable of selecting and using one or more or a combination of the incorporated search technologies. 
The instrument should be cylindrical in design with one end that is pointed and rugged enough to use as a probe. The probe shaft and handle should carry all of the instrumentation and components. The overall length of the instrument should be no more than 18 inches and no more than 1 inch in diameter. The handle should conform to the instrument, should not extend or protrude off of the instrument, and should surround the electronics. The pointed tip of the probe should carry the active sensor technology; the shaft of the probe should carry the passive sensor technology.  
The controls should be simple on/off selectable, thumb wheel type, easily used with one hand. The instrument should have a selectable on/off intensity switch for controlling a visual and audible indicator. The visual indicator should consist of intensity indicator lights only. 
The instrument should be capable of one handed operation. Overall weight should be 5 - 8 lbs; counterbalanced; or with wrist or forearm support to facilitate use. The design should utilize a commercial off the shelf power supply such as a 3 volt Li-ion battery, Mil BA 5590 battery or cells, or standard "D" cells. The power supply should be integrated into the instrument if possible, if not, a plug in power pack is acceptable. The instrument should be capable of continuous operation for 2-4 hours. The instrument should be ruggedized, capable of operating in all weather and all terrains.
Overall use is for the instrument to function much like a mine probe with a selectable passive and active detection capability. The total time of the effort must be completed in 18 months or less. 
Responses: Specific performance data and materials compatibility information should be provided.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. Offers having the technical skills and capabilities to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought.   Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  Responses should address how the Offeror can meet any part or all of the above requirements and should not exceed five (5) pages in total.
Please submit responses to Wanda Maddox, Contract Specialist via email at wanda.maddox@dtra.mil no later than 12:00 P.M. (Eastern Standard Time) on December 3, 2007.

<DESC>UAS Sense and Avoid RFI 	This request for information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under FAR, Part 10, and is not a request for proposals. 	The U.S. Army Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Project Office, Redstone Arsenal, AL is seeking information concerning a Sense and Avoid system (SAA) suitable for integration on all classes of UAS operated by the U. S. Army.    	Currently, UAS do not have routine convenient access to the National Air Space (NAS) primarily due to their inability to provide an on board equivalent level of safety similar to manned aircraft.   The FAA requires UAS to provide a see (or sense) and a void capability equivalent to that of manned aircraft in order to permit their operation in the NAS.  This capability to see (or sense) and avoid (SAA) must be effective against all other air traffic whether or not they are cooperative (transponder equipp ed) or non-cooperative and under all weather conditions (VMC to IMC).  The SAA system on the UAS must be capable against balloons, gliders and parachutes. Both fully autonomous and pilot in the loop solutions will be considered.  SAA for UAS flight operati ons is the primary goal however ground operations capability is also desired.   	All technology approaches to a viable UAS SAA system are of interest.  Some level of SAA commonality across various classes (sizes) of UAS is desirable but may not be feasible in all cases due to size, weight and power (SWAP) restrictions. It is understoo d that a single technology approach may not provide the reliability and redundancy required in all situations (day, night, weather, clouds, etc.), therefore this request is for either an integrated SAA system or individual technology components (including sensors, data fusion/processing, software algorithms, etc.).  	Information obtained through this RFI will be used by the Government to better understand the technologies available or being pursued that are applicable to the UAS Sense and Avoid solution and the current status of those technologies.  This information w ill be used to develop the requirements for modeling and simulation and test capabilities for sense and avoid systems.  The Government is considering the modeling and simulation, integration and testing of SAA systems on UAS within the next 1-3 years. 	Respondents to this RFI should provide as much information as possible, including but not limited to the follows elements: 1.	Technology description and operation 2.	Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3.	Integrated system or component(s) 4.	Specifications such as: a.	Azimuth and Elevation coverage b.	Range c.	Resolution d.	Accuracy e.	Day/Night capability f.	VMC/IMC capability 5.	Traceability to the design and performance specifications of ASTM Standard F 2411 (latest edition). 6.	System testing and results 7.	Modeling & Simulation status 8.	System level of autonomy (pilot in the loop vs. fully autonomous  collision avoidance) 9.	Size, weight and power of the system/component 10.	Communication/Data link requirements 11.	Sensor fusion capability 12.	Algorithms developed or required 	As indicated in FAR 52.215-3, Request For Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), (a) the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an  allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although proposal and offeror may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as infor mation only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information that will be used to develop the requirements for modeling and simulation and test capabilities for sense and avoid systems.  Approp riately marked proprietary information, submitted as a result of this RFI, will be rece ived and protected accordingly by the U.S. Government. Written responses are requested to this RFI by close of business 21 December 2007 to the following address:  Commander, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSAM-AC-AR-A, Lloyd Smith, Contract Specialist; telephone 256-313-4299, e-mail:  Lloyd.S mith@peoavn.army.mil.  In addition to the responses received under this RFI, respondents may be asked to provide additional written information for clarification and/or to provide more detail via telephone or face-to-face discussions.

<SUBJECT>99 -- This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the P/L:
B3 Aviator Pen and Refill, NSNs: 7520-00-NIB-1754, 7510-00-NIB-0797.  The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 

Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing a similar type of pen to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar pens would fit the following description:  Provides smooth-writing black ink, red ink, and .5mm pencil capabilities combined with a slim design--perfect for flight suit/uniform & other small pockets.  Precision balanced with 360 degree twist action; all metal construction and non-reflective finish.  The screw-top eraser is foreign object damage compliant.  Refill packs including black, red, pencil & erasers are available.

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing aviator (or similar) pens to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 12, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, New York.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Pushpins, Assorted Colors to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Pushpins, Assorted Colors to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 12, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY NEUTRON PILLAR DETECTOR FABRICATION
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
NEUTRON PILLAR DETECTOR FABRICATION


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to further develop neutron pillar detector fabrication technology. This technology addresses applications associated with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), and DOE. In preparation for possible future solicitations from the U.S. Government for an advanced demonstration of this technology, LLNL is seeking potential commercial partners that could respond to such a solicitation.

Background: Present technology for thermal neutron detection suffers from fieldability
issues. Special neutron converter materials are used to react with neutrons to produce charged particles that can  interact with semiconductor materials to generate electrical signals. A need exists for improved high-efficiency neutron detectors based on materials having three dimensional structures at the micro dimensional scale level. LLNL?s neutron pillar detector fabrication technology is directed to such a need.

Description:  	LLNL?s neutron ?pillar? detector fabrication technology uses semiconductor-based micro-structured elements as an electrical signal generation medium for the detection of neutrons. These materials in the form of semiconductor ?pillars? embedded in matrix of high cross-section neutron converter materials (such as Boron)  that emit charged particles upon interaction with neutrons. These charged particles in turn generate electron-hole pairs and thus detectable electrical current in the semiconductor micro-structured elements.
	To view the LLNL Pillar 3 D Design, go to:
	https://ipo.llnl.gov/technology/profile/announcement/NeutronPillarDetectorFabrication.php
 
Advantages:  

1.	The main advantage of the ?pillar? detector design emerges from the greatly enhanced fieldability of this all-solid-state device over the 3He gas detectors currently in wide spread use.

2.	We are able to eliminate the need for high voltage and pressure and to reduce the sensitivity to vibrations.  

3.	The power requirements are greatly diminished.

Potential Applications:  

Potential applications for the pillar detector include:

?	Military, civil, or medical applications in the field or laboratory environment 

?	Radiation detection for counter terrorism and contamination control 

?	Luggage or cargo container inspection in airports and ports 

?	Radiation detection for particles accelerators and cyclotrons 

?	Analyzing samples in the laboratory environment 

Development Status:  

A patent application has been filed for this invention.  Most of the fabrication steps have been developed and the overall integrated device is currently being pursued.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Neutron Pillar Detector Fabrication technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	Current annual report or other overview of company organization and the proposal team members
4.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology
5.	Experience relevant to working on Federally funded joint research projects
6.	Experience with silicon processing, plasma etching and clean room capabilities for radiation detection technologies
7.	Experience in developing neutron-based detectors
8.	Experience working with Department of Homeland Security

Written responses should be directed to:

Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of the contract, which resulted from this BAA, and therefore will have met FAR/DFARS requirements and the Competition in Contracting Act. 
AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposal?s technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. 
POINTS OF CONTACT ? The offerors may email the technical point of contact at Stephen.Cook@navy.mil, and roberta.nethercutt@navy.mil for contractual guidance.

Measurement of projectile velocities from 1500 m/s to ~20 m/s is required while the projectile is interacting with a target.   The targets are frequently polymer composites (polyethylene and Kevlar are typical), but targets may include a ceramic, and the ceramic may be wrapped in a carbon fiber composite. Event time may be as short as 5 microseconds or as long as 200 ms.  Projectile diameter may be as large as 1/2inch and as small as 0.04 inch  Projectiles may deform during impact. Length may change by as much as a factor of 5; diameter may change by as much as a factor of 4 during the impact event.  It is preferable to gather data for projectile head velocity and tail velocity (2 radar systems may be required one from viewpoint of the gun one from behind the target).   Radar will be used in an indoor ballistics range.  Nominal range dimensions are 10x10x100 feet.  Targets are most frequently placed within 30 feet of the gun. Projectiles will be fired from either a gunpowder-propelled or compressed gas-propelled gun.  A sabot may be used to fire projectiles.
