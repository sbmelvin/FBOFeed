<DESC><strong>**THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE EFFORT. IN ORDER TO BE AWARDED A BOA FOR THIS EFFORT, YOU MUST BE CONSIDERED A SMALL BUSINESS (CAPABLE OF PERFORMING A MINIMUM OF 51% OF EACH ORDER ) UNDER THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE DEFINED BELOW.**</strong>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) AIR-4.5.11 Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division with kitting, material equipment list (MEL) items, material parts list (MPL) items, metalwork, and fabrication of cable assemblies in support of the Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV) program, as well as other programs that have requirements that fall within this scope of work.</p>
<p>A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Delivery/Task Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. The BOA template to be utilized is attached to this notice. The Contracting Officer will advertise the BOA through the Federal Business Opportunities website annually (at a minimum), to maximize competition for the duration of the effort.</p>
<p>Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for price proposals leading to award of orders. Issuance of BOAs will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Firm-fixed price orders will be competed among the BOA Holders. Individual orders will not be synopsized unless it is determined by the Contracting Officer that the requirements of FAR Part 5 have not been met by this notice for a specific order, or otherwise determines that synopsis of the requirement is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>BOA's will be issued to provide the Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division with kitting, material equipment list (MEL) items, material parts list (MPL) items, metalwork, and fabrication of cable assemblies in support of the Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV) program, as well as, other programs that have requirements that fall within this scope of work. The NAICS code that will be used for future BOA competitions is as follows: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">334290</span>.</p>
<p>Contractors shall provide a capability statement that demonstrates that they meet the following qualifications for issuance of a BOA for all of the following areas: metalwork, kitting, fabrication of cable assemblies. The evaluation criteria is as follows:</p>
<p>1) Technical: Contractor shall provide (a) a detailed discussion of the approach that will be taken to meet the requirements as described in the SOW; (b) information which demonstrates an experienced machining facility capable of meeting requirements as specified in the SOW within a 60 day timeframe; (c) documentation to verify they meet commercial certification requirements for routing, solder, and fiber as listed in SOW paragraph 2.0; (d) information regarding how the contractor will maintain an effective quality assurance program to ensure performance is in accordance with the SOW, and (e) information which addresses the contractor's ability to perform a minimum of 51% of each indiviudal order awarded against the BOA. The offeror shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective equipment.</p>
<p>2) Experience: Provide five (5) contracts your firm has performed that contain efforts similar to those efforts required by this solicitation, within the last three years (not to have exceeded 3 years since completion) to include contract numbers, value of contracts, points of contact for reference with phone numbers, email addresses, period of performance and a brief description of the contract. Experience information submitted must have a logical connection to the requirement. Contractors shall submit the above information as part of their capability statement for both the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors (if applicable). Attachment 1, Experience Evaluation Form, shall be used to submit all experience information.</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria identified above will be used to evaluate contractor's capability statement for issuance of a BOA:</p>
<p>1) Technical. Technical shall be evaluated for acceptability only on a pass/fail basis. Evaluation of Technical will be determined based on the contractor's responses to each aspect of the technical evaluation criteria requested in paragraph 1 above. The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical capbility statement to determine its ability to meet the requirements of the SOW, its ability to meet commercial certification requirements for routing, solder, and fiber, its ability to maintain an effective quality assurance program to ensure performance is in accordance with the SOW and its ability to perform a minimum of 51% of each order awarded against the resulting BOA.</p>
<p>2) Experience. Experience shall be evaluated for acceptability only on a pass/fail basis. Evaluation of experience will be determined based on contractor's responses to each aspect of the experience evaluation criteria requested in paragraph 2 above. The Government will consider the relevancy of the experience data. To be considered relevant, the contractor must demonstrate execution of similar contracts for metalwork, kitting and cable assembly in terms of complexity, magnitude of effort, schedule and scope. Additionally, the experience must have occurred during the last three (3) years. The Government reserves the right to contact the listed points of contact for each reference to verify the information submitted.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA to a contractor who fails to meet the above stated criteria. <br /><br />The period of performance of these BOAs will be for a period of five years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, NAVAIR may continue to place orders under the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms must review the BOA template and indicate their ability and agreement to comply with all of the terms and conditions as stated. Contractors must have representations and certifications registered on the ORCA website located at https://orca.bpn.gov/, and also be registered on the website System for Award Management located at https:// www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a capability statement (not to exceed 12 pages) in response to this announcement to be evaluated for issuance of a BOA.
