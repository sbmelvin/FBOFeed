<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of software maintenance and licenses in support of the FAA Maintenance Monitoring System (MMS) via Golden Gate, Incorporated's Golden Gate Transactional Data Management (TDM) Platform software.  The software provides for high volumes of data to be moved between MMS platforms and the Operational Data Store System (ODS), thus allowing queries of NAS performance data while preventing direct access to the MMS.  The period of performance for the contract is March 1, 2007 through February 29, 2008. The FAA intends to award this action to Golden Gate, Incorporated since they are the manufacturer and only licensed maintainer of the Golden Gate TDM Platform software. This announcement is for informational purposes only; however, any inquiries should be directed to the FAA point of contact.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-07 WNaN Adaptive Network Development (WAND); CLOSING DATE: 22 February 2009; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  31 May 2007; 12:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Points of Contact:  Preston Marshall, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-07@darpa.mil; Web site: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicit/WAND/index.htm. This BAA plus the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute the full BAA and proposers must obtain and follow the details of submission set forth in the PIP.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals for BAA 07-07, Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) Adaptive Network Development (WAND). The goal of the WAND effort is to design and develop the network technologies necessary to establish ultra-large (tens of thousands of nodes), highly-scalable, highly-adaptive ad-hoc networks that provide robust networking across densely-connected deployments of inexpensive wireless nodes.  The WNaN premise is that WAND-enabled networks will adapt to changing conditions and mission requirements by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the wireless nodes, particularly at the physical and link layers, to create and maintain a rich, multiply-connected network fabric.  This rich interconnection fabric will provide superior battlefield communications at lower system cost and enhance survivability by ensuring information, applications, and services are readily available within the tactical environment.
The development of wireless nodes to support WAND is ongoing under the Wireless Adaptive Network Node (WANN) BAA (BAA06-26).  Contracts have been awarded under this BAA to develop and produce low-cost, highly adaptive wireless nodes, which will be delivered to WAND developers for network technology development, integration, test and demonstration.   The WANN wireless node developers will develop and publish non-proprietary network Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for design and integration of network technologies / processes within the node.  The APIs, which will be published in the 2nd QTR FY07, are the means by which the WNaN network will be able to control and manage the adaptive features of the wireless nodes.   Feedback on the draft APIs will be solicited from outside sources, including WAND proposers.
The WAND program will be conducted as 3 sequential phases to design, develop, integrate, and demonstrate network technologies that support the WNaN network vision.  The developed network technologies will support network scalability and network formation from two to tens of thousands of WNaN operational nodes.  Examples of features that are expected to be supported by the WNaN network are listed below.  Note that the list is not in order of priority or dependency.
1.	The WNaN network should be aware of, and have the ability to adapt to, the mission and the environment, and be able to organize topologies in response to traffic flow and QoS across the entire range of tactical dynamics, network size, and network density.  WNaN network should also be able to identify and create a unified /coordinated approach to interference management by exploiting technologies as trades at multiple layers to maximize performance within spectrum management, network layer and physical layer constraints.
2.	The WNaN network should be able to identify and instantiate the "Best Mission Topology" rather than passively accepting network topology and routing as given.  WNaN network should create topology by allocating/modifying resources such as spectrum, interference, routing responsibility, battery power, MIMO, etc.
3.	The WNaN network should be able to interconnect with non-WNaN infrastructures at multiple, dynamic points of presence -- wherever and whenever a connection to the infrastructure can be created - rather than at a single, fixed point of presence.  (See Figure 4 in the PIP.)
4.	The WNaN network should provide the ability to create distributed computing environments where the applications and services are populated / migrated onto nodes according to demand, traffic flows, network congestion and resource availability.  (See Figure 4 in the PIP.)
5.	The WNaN network should be able to implement intelligent multicast protocols and caching mechanisms as appropriate to optimize streaming services, intelligent multicast, predictable performance, bandwidth reservation and end-to-end congestion control.
6.	The WNaN network should be able to support, as appropriate, cross-layer adaptation mechanisms that work together to optimize network performance and reduce stress on inexpensive physical layer devices.
7.	The WNaN network should be able to use policy and reasoning techniques to drive topology formation and load sharing.
8.	The WNaN network should be capable of supporting persistent caching and content-based access of information within the network.  The objective is to retrieve once and then be able to provide to local users as requested.
9.	The WNaN network should be able to support multiple network structures and multiple network frameworks to optimize delivery of high speed / low latency streaming / data services.  The network should provide both Connectionless and Connection-Oriented Services as appropriate.
10.	When the network experiences delays and disruptions, the WNaN network should be able to sense the impairment and to mitigate the effect of these impairments using techniques such as Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) to knit together heterogeneous network fabrics and to operate with episodic connectivity effectively. 
11.	The WNaN network should be able to asynchronously introduce new policies and policy controlled functions without code changes.   Policies and policy controlled functions could be linked symbolically through an extensible semantic structure.
Proposers are encouraged to add to this list of network features as necessary to support the program vision and goals.  It is anticipated that some or all WNaN network instantiations will autonomously and continuously determine the appropriate implementation of network features based on the environment, mission, and data.  The instantiation should consider and appropriately balance the needs of the individual nodes and the network enterprise.

This BAA shall remain open through 22 February 2009. Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.   Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instructions provided in the PIP at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-07) on or before 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on 31 May 2007.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs) and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small, or small and disadvantaged businesses due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transactions for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.
A Proposers' Day Conference will be held on 27 February 2007.  The information from this conference will be available on the WAND website: www.darpa.mil/sto/solicit/WAND/index.htm.  Attendance at the Proposers' Day is not a prerequisite to responding to this BAA.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the four Evaluation Criteria.  The proposed Evaluation Criteria in descending order of importance are: 1) Technical Approach with elements: (a) WNaN Network Technology meets the Program Vision, (b) Program Development Plans, and (c) Program Schedule and Milestones; 2) Management Approach; 3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and 4) Cost and Schedule Reasonableness and Realism.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA, and to make award without discussions.   Further, DARPA may choose to select for negotiation all of a given proposal, or from selected portions thereof, and make award without discussion. 
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must obtain the PIP associated with this BAA. You can access these documents at www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY & ASSESSEMENT Program Management, Acquisition Management, System Engineering, Operations Planning for the FAA Office of Technology Development  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) inform Industry of an upcoming procurement;  2) solicit comments on the Statement of Work; 3) assess market interest and capability of potential offerors. BACKGROUND: The Directorate of Operations Planning Technology Development Services, ATO-P  provides aviation engineering services that are an integral component of the National Airspace System (NAS) planning and operational system.  The NAS provides the flying public with air traffic control services designed to ensure air transportation safety.  ATO-P is responsible for providing technical and engineering direction and program management for multiple projects through various stages of development and NAS implementation.  ATO-P must satisfy the technical requirements of the NAS as envisioned and implemented by the FAA. The Draft Statement of work (SOW) is attached.  Included are specific project tasks and general tasks. A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in late March early April 2007. We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract.  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $9 Million over a 5 year period.   Responses to the below Capability Statement questions are to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competitive procurement for small business. The North American Industry Classification Code designated for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services. This classification uses $6.5 Million annual gross sales as the threshold to be considered a small business.  The FAA requests the following information from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions: A. Has your firm provided similar type services or supported similar type Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) programs as described in the SOW. How recently?  If so please elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance. B. Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW and any other relative comments and suggestions.  2. Discuss expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). If respondent is an SBA 8(a) certified business, or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 3. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. And if applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey may result in the government determining there are not sufficient qualified small business' interested to set aside this procurement  for small business. Therefore, a full and open competition would be considered.  Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.

<DESC>Notice of Pre-solicitation Conference:  General Services Administration Multi-channel Contact Center requirement.

Location:  A pre-solicitation conference that has been scheduled for Monday, March 5, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) at the American Institute of Architects (AIA).  ALA is located at 1735 New York Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C.  The conference will be held in the Second Floor Board Room.

Directions: The AIA is adjacent to GSA?s building, as well as the Corcoran and the Octagon House. The nearest intersection is 18th and E Streets, N.W. This is five blocks south of the Farragut West metro station (blue and orange lines).  The AIA is located behind the Octagon house.  It is a modern building, with a sculpture of a silver circle in the courtyard in front. 

Purpose:  The purpose of this conference is to provide Federal departments and agencies, and our industry partners with an opportunity to comment on the draft requirements for multi-channel contact center services and to provide a venue for large and small businesses to network on partnering plans for the forthcoming solicitation. 

Background:  Over the past three years, the GSA has been responsible for implementing and maintaining the USA Services E-Gov initiative.  The objective of this initiative is to provide high quality, cost-effective contact center solutions for Federal departments and agencies, and to provide these services in a manner that meets the immediate needs of these Federal customers.  To support this initiative, GSA has developed a requirement to provide a full range of multi-channel contact center solutions.  The scope of this work involves providing a wide range of automated and attended information services through multiple communications channels, including:  telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile and postal mail. The scope of this work is intended to support all Federal departments and agencies that operate programs which require the support of contact center services.  Through the award of multiple, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for multi-channel contact center solutions, GSA fully intends to leverage its extensive experience and anticipated requirements into a program that allows other Federal departments and agencies to identify and process their contact center services faster, smarter and at a far lower overall costs than they otherwise would be able to do through their own resources.

Services:  The attached draft documents will provide you with our current thinking on the ten (10) year pricing schedule and the services that will be provided under this requirement.  These documents call for the contractors to:  (i) provide a wide range of automated and customer support services, using multiple communication channels, to respond to inquiries about Federal government programs, policies, information sources, and agencies from the general public, Congressional offices, business and professional communities, academia, government offices, and electronic and print media.     The multiple communication channels include telephone, e-mail, the internet, facsimile, postal mail and other media as appropriate; (ii) provide and maintain all required facilities, equipment, software, supplies, and services, to support the automated and customer support services and technical and management functions; (iii) provide sufficient qualified personnel to support all automated and customer support services and to perform all required technical and management functions; (iv) provide solutions that fully comply with federal information system security requirements; (v) provide services that are fully accessible by individuals with disabilities as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998; (vi) perform all technical and management functions needed to plan, design, implement, operate, and manage these services.  To include: site management, program management, technology management, information systems security, content and knowledge management, contact/case management, relationship management, and customer satisfaction survey support; (vi) provide special project support needed to analyze, plan, design, implement, operate and manage special customer support services that may be needed to meet the diverse needs of the Government; and (vii) conduct public outreach and advertising programs which include publishing telephone numbers in telephone directories for agency-specified service areas.  In performing this requirement the contractor will provide (i) all necessary personnel, training, supervision, administrative support and management; (ii) all facilities, supplies, equipment and IT hardware and services; (iii) all telecommunications except that provided by the Government, (iv) all software and research and reference materials except those provided by the Government; (v) current information to the public according to Government direction; and (vi) a quality control program.  The contractor will be able to perform the work requirements of their contract at one work site within the United States, or at multiple work sites within the United States.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

CLIN 1000: It is assumed that there is a nominal need for miscellaneous repairs.  CLIN 900: It is assumed that twenty percent (20%) of the units will require an emergency repair during the life of the contract. CLIN 1200: It is assumed that ten percent (10%) of the total number of units installed will need to be temporarily deactivated during the life of the contract.  This normally is associated with demolition of an adjacent damaged structure.  Unit deactivation assumes all units will be deactivated during the life of the contract.

Marine Corps System Command is interested in a Commercial- Off-The-Shelf (COTS) system or capability that can provide upper air, (surface to 30 kilometers), data in the battle-space that can be used immediately or ingested in later cycle runs of Numerical Weather Prediction models.  This system or capability may be autonomous, but should not require the use of balloons or radiosondes as do current systems employed in the theater of operations.  This system or capability should be expeditionary, that is, it should not require t!  he use of a vehicle and should be transportable on a single High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and capable of supporting military operations in all potential theaters of conflict.  The system should also be capable of leveraging any existing sensors installed on manned and unmanned systems or vehicles.   Responses to this request for information for a COTS solution should have a system or capability that will provide:       	a.  Meteorological data from surface to altitude of          30 kilometers. b.  Measure Wind Speed     	c.  Measure Wind Direction     	d.  Measure Temperature      	e.  Measure Pressure     	f.  Measure Humidity (Relative)      	g. Meteorological data output as standard World Meteorological Organization (WMO) meteorological upper-air messages as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization Standardization Agreement (NATO STANAG), Ballistic Type 2 (MET:B2), Ballistic Type 3 (MET:B3), Computer Met (MET:CM) Fall Out Met (MET:FM), Target Acquisition Met (MET:TA) and Chemical Downwind Met Message.     h.  Provide data suitable for transmission to weather agencies such as Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Fleet Numerical Meteorological Oceanographic Center (FNMOC), and Meteorological Mobile Facilities (Replacement) (METMF-R), or other government or commercial weather data centers and subsequent ingest to their numerical weather models. All vendors having the capability of meeting these requirements as requested, in whole or in part, are requested to submit a copies of relevant documentation in response to this Request for Information at no cost to the Government.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule if applicable.

It is antic!  ipated to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (completion) type contract with a total period of performance from the date of award through three (3) years thereafter.  The intended source is Alcoa of New Kensington, PA under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements because it is not feasible to find another contractor with the capabilities, familiarity, and unique experience in aluminum alloys and the manufacturing processes employed in the aluminum industry.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Siemens Communications, Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) Information Technology and Communications Directorate (ITCD). This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-02032 for a period of up to 6-months from March 31, 2007 through September 30, 2007 and increase the maximum ordering value in order to allow sufficient time to award the follow-on procurement.   The ITCD is currently working to refine their requirements in order to go forward with the most efficient and effective set of requirements for the follow-on to the current Telecommunications Maintenance and Operations Support Services contract.  This extension will allow for a continuation of current delivery orders issued, for modifications to existing delivery orders, and for new work until the Telecommunications Maintenance and Operations Support Services follow-on contract is awarded.  The contract extension and maximum ordering value increase are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical and programmatic impacts to GSFC.   The current contractor provides the following highly specialized mission critical services to NASA's GSFC ITCD: Responsibility for the continued day-to-day operation and maintenance support for the ITS which consists of six (6) Siemens Hicom 300 H Version 1 System Communications Servers, Phonemail, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Interactive Voice Response(IVR) System, Hicom Domain Management System (HDMS) Modular, Information Management System (Comsoft), and the Uninterruptible Power System (UPS); relocating existing equipment; performing new installations; providing new system design, testing and documentation, cable plant, and maintenance of ITS related data bases at the Greenbelt site.  At the Wallops site, the current contractor is responsible for continued day-to-day operation and maintenance support for two (2) Siemens Hicom 300 H Version 1 Communication Servers (one located at the Main base and the other located at Wallops Island), Phonemail, HDMS, the Information Management System (Comsoft) and the UPS.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, Siemens is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA's GSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM. local time on March 12, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for two additional Coarse Sun Sensor Units (CSS), ten CSS stimulators, and one stimulator control panel for the ten CSS stimulators to support the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) under Contract NNG06ED61C to Adcole Corporation in Marlborough, Massachusetts.  Adcole Corporation shall provide two additional CSS units, ten CSS stimulators, and one stimulator control panel for the ten CSS stimulators.  Adcole is currently under contract to supply 22 CSS units for the LRO Project.  The LRO is required to possess redundant CSS units and the additional CSS units must have identical form, fit and function as the original CSS units.	Adcole Corporation, as the original vendor for the LRO CSS units, is the only source that can build the identical CSS units and provide for the CSS stimulators and stimulator control panel for these CSS stimulators.   The two additional CSS units must be the exact design as those that are currently being provided by Adcole.  Additionally, the CSS stimulators and control panel must interface directly to the CSS units.   This combined with the adherence to the existing project schedule is paramount for us to meet our launch schedule as requested in the Presidents Vision for U.S. Space Exploration.  To ensure we meet our October 2008 launch date with acceptable technical and schedule risk, this procurement must be awarded by early 2007.  The estimated period of performance of this firm-fixed-price (FFP) effort is approximately 6 months.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Notes 22, 26, and B. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for independent special studies, technical systems analyses and assessments of selected NASA issues, programs, and projects.  This requirement will be for a period of five (5) years. NASA/MSFC intends to procure the services from The Aerospace Corporation, which is the only known independent contractor with the experience and skill mix available to meet the requirement.  The uniqueness of the need for independent critical assessments or studies and requirement to independently report on the potential program or study risk to NASA/MSFC management for use in their decision making processes limits the potential contractors to those without a conflict of interest.  The Aerospace Corporation, for example, is not involved in performance of the Discovery and New Frontiers Program which allows them to maintain their objectivity and independent status. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 12, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Nick Graham, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 418-5191, Fax (202) 418-5414, Email ngraham@cftc.gov
<DESC>CFTC intends to issue a Request for Proposals for commercial off the shelf (COTS) software for trade violation detection.  

BACKGROUND:  The Commission's overall mission is to ensure market integrity and customer protection in the futures markets through effective oversight.  To accomplish this mission, the Division of Market Oversight (DMO) staff engages in various analyses to profile trading activity and conduct investigations to detect and prosecute possible trading abuses.  These functions all require the collection of trade data and the ability to process those data in various ways for further analysis.  In this regard, the Commission currently operates the Exchange Database System (EDBS), a system developed to process and maintain information concerning trade activity at each U.S. futures exchange.  The primary function of EDBS is to collect and make trade data accessible to futures trading specialists and investigators so that they can retrieve, organize, and analyze trade data to assess compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act, Commission regulations, and exchange rules. A new trade violation detection tool will assist staff in conducting timely, customized trading analyses and detecting novel, sophisticated and complex patterns of potential trading violations.  The trade violation detection tool will also allow the Commission to quickly respond to fast-moving market events.  

DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT: The new trade violation detection tool, applied to a SQL database for electronic and open outcry exchange trade data, must identify and score potential trade practice abuses and alert DMO staff whenever such a potential abuse has been found.  The software must also enable DMO staff to perform initial analysis of the data in order to assess the legitimacy of the potential abuse.  A trade violation detection tool should have the capability to automatically detect and flag specific trade execution patterns and trade anomalies; compute, retain, and compare trading statistics; compute trade gains, losses, and futures-equivalent positions; reconstruct the sequence of market activity; perform inter-market and intra-market analyses; and support users to perform specialized analyses and ad hoc queries.

This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  Offerors are advised that questions regarding this pre-solicitation notice should be held until the RFP is posted.  CFTC anticipates the release of the RFP on or about March 23, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.

<SUBJECT>D -- GPO Composition System Replacement (CSR) Opportunity RFI
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-GPO-CSR-2007
<RESPDATE>030807
<ARCHDATE>03232007
<CONTACT>Herbert Jackson,Jr., Chief, Acquisition Services, Phone 202-512-0916, Fax 202-512-0975, Email hjackson@gpo.gov - Larry Ferezan, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone 202-512-2010x31502, Fax 202-512-1481, Email lferezan@gpo.gov
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only!    

The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is currently looking for information in order to assess the current state of available technology for a composition system designed to replace its current composition system. The current system is focused around a legacy batch composition engine called Microcomp. An estimated 700 related applications and utilities have been developed over the years to sustain and enhance Microcomp in order to support the evolving needs of GPO?s Congressional customers, in-house print and bindery processes and electronic access. Microcomp is currently used to compose the majority of Congressional documents produced by GPO and extends to a few key Executive agency publications. These products are printed and disseminated electronically by GPO. The opportunity expressed in this RFI is referred to as Composition System Replacement (CSR) and is envisioned as a replacement to and improvement of the current functionality provided by Microcomp, which is a precise, high-end and robust composition program that specifically addresses key challenges in the production of Congressional publications.

The envisioned CSR system will be aligned with GPO?s Strategic Vision for a 21st Century and the agency?s enterprise architecture (EA). It will also integrate with evolving enterprise architecture in order to automate many content lifecycle processes, back office functions, and delivery of the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. The system will be rules based to facilitate the migration of content into future data tagging schemes/technologies while utilizing industry best practices. CSR must use the typographic style and page layout of current printed publications as well as support enhanced search, retrieval, data formats, and repurposing of data.

GPO is requesting industry assessment of our documentation as well as information to determine the capabilities of vendors to provide some or all of the services required for CSR.  This information will be used to revise, if necessary, our Requirements and Concept documentation in order to deliver a world-class composition system. 

Background:
GPO is the Federal government?s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.  Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and Government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them to efficiently and cost effectively produce printed documents.  GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has also served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications.  
Microcomp is currently used to compose the majority of Congressional documents and select Federal agency publications that are printed and disseminated electronically by GPO. Microcomp was originally designed to compose data files with typesetting-specific codes called locators. Locator codes are tied to external format files that specify style attributes to be applied to segments of content. 
CSR will count among its user classes over 200 content creators working in all branches of the government and congress and over 100 Government composition operators.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE), Cherry Point, NC intends to issue a modification to extend the FRC's Transportation Support Services Contract N00421-02-D-3112 with LBM, Inc. of Dunn, NC for an additional five months of support.  This support is needed to bridge an anticipated gap in service until a follow-on contract can be competitively awarded under a solicitation to be released.  LBM, Inc. is the current provider of these services under contract N00421-02-D-3112, which will expire on 30 April 2007.  This modification is required to provide Transportation Services from 01 May 2007 through 30 September 2007.  The effort includes towing and fueling/defueling aircraft, providing forklift services, mule and mule train services, as well as local and long-distance light and heavy trucking support.  These and other similar transportation support services are needed to transport aircraft and aircraft parts and accessories in support of the FRC East's mission of repairing and overhauling DoD aircraft and aircraft parts and assemblies.  The services shall be performed at the FRC East Facility located on the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, NC, adjacent to the town of Havelock, NC.  This notice is for information purposes only.  The continuation of effort can only be accomplished reasonably and without impairing continued support through the issuance of a modification to the current contract with LBM, Inc.  Only LBM possesses the technical knowledge and qualified personnel to continue the support services currently being performed.  It is not possible for any other potential source to become familiar enough with the tasking and to obtain the necessary site-specific training and certifications needed to sustain this workload without a break in service.  These are continuing tasks and are time sensitive.  There are no other sources capable of providing uninterrupted support.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Replacement of Power Supply for Precision X-Ray Equipment

Purpose/Brief History:

The purpose of the Tumor Biology Branch is to investigate various ways of studying and treating tumors using ionizing radiation or chemotherapy drugs or by combining both agents.  The Tumor Biology Section investigates mechanisms that increase the effects of ionizing radiation on tumor growth or processes that reduce the effects of radiation on normal tissue.  The TTB evaluates a 
wide variety of drugs to examine what interaction (if any) they will have in conjunction with ionizing radiation.  For the last 5 years TTB has utilized a self shielded, enclosed x-ray system produced by Precision x-ray, Inc for our biological samples.  When properly working and calibrated it is a rapid and safe method of delivering radiation.  

Replacement of the current power supply to our Precision X-Ray Inc. equipment, will ensure that the Tumor Biology Branch's projects will go forward without any loss of downtime due to the 
increasing possibility of failure of our older equipment.
 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Precision X-Ray, Inc. is the only vendor that can upgrade the outdated power supply.  They are the only known vendor that has a power supply that is compatible with the current x-ray tube system.   Precision X-ray, Inc. is the only vendor with the necessary replacement components, and the knowledge of our government owned self shielded enclosed x-ray system to do the upgrade.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Systems Positioning Wing hereby posts the  Request for Proposal number FA8807-07-R-0001 for the Next Generation GPS Control Segment (OCX) to the GPS Bidder?s Library.  The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

	(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
	(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 

A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the ARINC conference facility-Kilroy Airport Center 2250 E. Imperial Highway, El Segundo CA 90245-with check-in starting at 8:00 a.m. and the conference beginning at 8:30 a.m. on 8 Mar 07 for the purpose of answering questions regarding this solicitation.  Offerors should refer to clause 5352.215-9001 NOTICE OF PRE-BID/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE contained in Section L of the model contract for further guidance.
 
The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces.  OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time.  GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC)  2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC  14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. This acquisition executes those statutory mandates.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.

The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner.  He may be reached at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

Amendment 01: The purpose of this notice is to correct the voltage/frequency information included in the original RFI.

RFI:
This notice is a form of market research and serves as a Request for Information Only:

The Department of State?s European Logistic Support Office (ELSO) seeks to identify European sources of American style household appliances (Washing Machines, Dryers, Ovens, etc).     ELSO currently purchases bulk quantities of American style products, which it receives via sea freight from the United States, and subsequently sells units to American Diplomatic Posts throughout the Europe, Africa, and Asia.           

In an effort to streamline its supply chain, ELSO seeks major brand name manufacturers with operations in continental Europe that produce appliances destined for the American marketplace (120V 50Hz). Ideally, ELSO hopes to significantly reduce delivery lead times while maintaining the major-brand name quality (Maytag, GE, Whirlpool, etc) that its customers expect and demand. 

Interested parties may send information to Thomas Lemole at (LemoleTC@State.gov).     

The Department of State currently seeks information only and does not solicit any supplies or services of any kind by this notice.

Introduction:

       The CPSC is concerned about the hazards posed to youth under 16 years of age riding All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs).  Incidents related to ATVs can result in death or serious injuries and/or lasting disabilities to youth.  CPSC staff has studied ATVs for many years, most recently in responding to a 2002 petition requesting a ban on the sale of adult four-wheeled ATVs for use by children and in developing a briefing package recommending that the Commission approve a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would set mechanical, labeling, point of sale, instruction, and training requirements for ATVs.  The NPR was subsequently approved by the Commission and published in the August 10, 2006, Federal Register. 

       In 2001, there were an estimated 2.8 million ATV drivers under the age of 16, and another 4.4 million children rode ATVs as passengers.  Children under 16 sustained about 31% of the estimated ATV-related injuries in 2001, and the societal costs associated with all medically attended injuries to children under 16 that year are estimated to be $2.5 billion.  The societal costs of ATV-related deaths to children in 2001 are estimated to have amounted to about $550 million.  Eighty-nine percent of child drivers who were injured were driving an adult ATV at the time.  Based on injury and exposure data estimated from surveys conducted in 2001, the risk of injury to drivers under the age of 16 on adult ATVs was roughly twice the risk for child drivers on youth ATVs.  

       The CPSC staff is considering various means to try to reduce youth deaths and injuries related to ATVs.  Since the risk to youth on adult ATVs is much higher than on youth ATVs, CPSC encourages all youth to ride appropriate youth ATVs.  For more background information on this issue, please see the staff briefing packages and other documents available on CPSC?s Web site (go to http://www.cpsc.gov/cgi-bin/foia.aspx, select All Terrain Vehicles, and click on Find).  The relevant documents with human factors information are as follows (in order of date, beginning with the most recent): (1) CPSC Staff Response Regarding Follow-Up Questions from Commissioner Moore after ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 07/11/2006, Youth ATVs: Questions 1 through 7 (beginning on p. 3 of 18), and Question 9 (beginning on p.7 of 18); (2) CPSC Staff Response to Commissioner Nancy Nord after the June 15, 2006 ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 06/30/2006, Question 3 (beginning on p. 3 of 7) and Question 4 (beginning on p.5 of 7); (3) All Terrain Vehicle Initiative, Part 2, dated 05/31/2006, especially Tabs H (p.138 of 229 through p.149 of 229) and I (p.150 of 229 through p.157 of 229); (4) Response to Questions from Commissioner Moore on CP-02-4/HP-02-1; Petition Requesting Ban of All-Terrain Vehicles Sold for Use by Children under Age 16, dated 08/22/2005, Question 8 (beginning on p. 3 of 6); (5) Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 3, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab H (p. 39 of 55 through p. 55 of 55); and (6) Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 4, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab I (p. 1 of 43 through p.6 of 43). 

       One of the strategies being proposed by the Commission to encourage youth to select appropriate ATVs is to characterize youth ATVs by speed rather than engine size, as is currently done.  (A chart showing CPSC?s proposed ATV models and intended ages is available on p. 45908 of the August 10, 2006, Federal Register notice.)

Request:

       The CPSC staff is interested in obtaining ideas, data, concepts, and feasibility information for human performance and behavioral research that supports or refutes the ATV requirements proposed for each category listed above.  CPSC staff realizes that, while the ideal of eliminating all hazards associated with ATV driving is not feasible, it may be possible to reduce the number of deaths and the severity of injuries, especially to youth.   

       The category recommendations listed in the above table are based on the existing voluntary standard (American National Standard for Four Wheel All-Terrain Vehicles ? Equipment, Configuration, and Performance Requirements, ANSI/SVIA-1-2001) and on published child development data reviewed by CPSC staff, including research on teen automobile driving.  There are, however, factors CPSC staff has been unable to investigate due to the lack of available research regarding youth ATV drivers.   CPSC staff is aware of little published data regarding the motorized vehicle driving skills of youth under age 16 even though some youth may have years of experience on dirt bikes and ATVs.  CPSC staff therefore would like to consider the feasibility of research specifically focused on youth ATV driving.  

General Questions:

       Responders should provide descriptions of the options available for obtaining human performance data regarding youth driving ATVs.  CPSC staff is particularly interested in the feasibility of obtaining data related to 1) human factors research related to vehicle design factors that may be relevant to youth ATV drivers such as a) appropriate speed, b) appropriate maximum ATV weight and/or driver weight to ATV weight ratio, and c) control design factors that may be specific to youth driving; 2) nighttime off-road driving performance and behavior of youth as compared to youth driving performance during daylight and adult driving performance, both during daylight and at night; 3) youth distractibility while driving ATVs; 4) the effects of peer pressure and the extent to which youth ATV drivers may be more or less susceptible to peer pressure than youth automobile drivers. 

       Responders should address the following questions in their submissions: 1) What are the possible methods that could be employed to collect the desired data? 2) Are there examples of existing research that have proven successful in collecting the desired data? 3)  Is there existing research regarding the off-road driving skills of youth? 4) What other human performance and behavior factors that may be relevant to youth ATV driving could and/or should be studied? 5) Would there be difficulties related to obtaining youth participants for a study of driving behavior (e.g., finding volunteers, research ethics, etc)?  6)  What is a reasonable rough estimate of the time, cost, and other resources needed for such a study?

Driving Simulator Specific Questions:

       CPSC staff is aware that one possible method for obtaining the needed data may be through use of driving simulators.  Responders who are familiar with simulator studies should provide documentation on the technical feasibility of using existing driving simulators to obtain human performance data regarding youth driving ATVs.  CPSC staff is particularly interested in the feasibility of obtaining data related to the maximum appropriate speeds for various categories of youth drivers and the nighttime driving performance of youth as compared to youth driving performance during daylight and adult driving performance both during the day and at night.
       
       Responders who wish to address simulator research should also address the following questions in their submissions: 1) Is the study of ATV driving with driving simulators a pragmatic, valid, and cost-effective methodology?  2) Are there existing high fidelity simulators for ATVs or similar motorized vehicles?  3) Can children be successful participants in a driving simulator study?  4) Can driving simulators accurately test nighttime driving skills? 5) Would a simulator be able to accurately reproduce the lighting effects of headlights? 6) Is it feasible to obtain data with a simulator suggesting maximum appropriate speeds for various categories of youth ATVs?  7) What other human performance and behavioral factors could be studied in a driving simulator that may be relevant to youth ATV driving? 8) Would the prevalence of driving-type video games that may be used by youth confound data obtained?  9) How do simulator studies translate to off-road driving conditions? 10) How do participants alter their behavior when using a simulator versus when driving in an actual off-road environment?  

How to Respond:

       Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing the likely success of research projects aimed at acquiring the data listed above, and including factual support for the assertions made therein.   If the responder provides a compilation of published example studies from other sources, the results should be summarized. 

       Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the Contracting Office address indicated above, Attn: Rudi Johnson no later than 02 April 2007.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. These additional licenses are needed to support  80TB of the recently procured backup system.  The original order only included 80TB, but actual need was for 160TB.  These licenses will be used to support the backup system being implemented at BIMC. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Symantec Veritas Netbackup is the only effective support for the backup system in place at BIMC.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) efforts essential to identifying novel materials and processes that can provide potential breakthroughs in solid hydrogen storage and accelerate the adoption of these technologies by the military. On-board hydrogen storage is considered to be one of the most technically challenging barriers for the successful widespread commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and subsequent reduction in U.S. petroleum imports. Many DOD applications require hydrogen storage and generation systems to be situated in confined spaces or battlefield environments (dust, broad temperature range, sea salt atmosphere, etc.). The overarching objectives of this program are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) associated with solid-state hydrogen storage materials and solid-state hydrogen storage systems integrated into!   vehicles.  Specific areas of interest (concept areas) include, but are not limited to: 1. High throughput combinatorial screening techniques to rapidly identify novel or breakthrough solid-state hydrogen storage materials for a broad range of adsorbent and doped materials suitable for military applications that can reversibly and reproducibly store hydrogen. 2. Sub-scale prototypes incorporating solid-state materials for the storage of hydrogen for Defense applications.  Specific goals for each concept area include, but are not limited to: Concept area #1: 	Developing screening processes and techniques applicable to a broad range of adsorbents, including doped materials, aimed at increasing hydrogen adsorption energies (above the typical 5 kJ/mol for such materials).   	Delivering the screening process documentation to demonstrate the ability to reproducibly screen a minimum of 10 solid state material adsorbents per run. o	Measuring adsorption at cryogenic temperatures (77 K) up to 150 C and up to 50 atmospheres Concept area #2: 	Demonstration sub-scale prototypes that include all necessary system components necessary for charge and discharge operation including thermal management, reactant flow control, humidification, etc., and that have the following characteristics: o	Storage capacity in the range from 0.1kg to less than 1kg of hydrogen (proposer shall specify) o	Maximum storage pressure of 200 atmospheres o	Moderate temperature of discharge (less than 150C) o	Discharge rate adequate to power fuel cell stack with between 0.5KW and 5KW peak power (proposer shall specify) 	Prototype evaluation and documentation identifying:  o	Potential environmental and safety issues, such as venting or gas leakage, related to the proposed technology. o	Operating performance such as kinetics of hydrogen charging and release o	Operability over a range of temperature conditions and durability o	Performance and durability under exposure to contaminants encountered in military (combat zone) environments o	Overall system gravimetric and volumetric energy capacity NSWC Crane and DLA are interested in receiving proposals in the aforementioned areas.  Proposals may be basic research, applied research, or advanced technology development.   Proposals cannot be for development of specific systems or hardware solutions but must be non-specific and have potential benefit across a wide spectrum of DOD applications. However, in all cases, applicants should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, significant improvements to national security and military operations.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until one year from its initial publication. Proposals for initial contract awards are due no later than 22 March 2007.

Overview: The Denali Commission wishes to engage a contractor to develop a message for the organization and align the message in various communication tools. The Commission operates and delivers multi-faceted programs and services to the public. These programs and services should be broadcast using a concise message. Historically, the Denali Commission has secured the services of various graphic designers and video producers to deliver the Denali Commission?s message to the public. Currently the Commission provides information to the general public through various avenues including:
Annual Report ? The Commission produces this document providing general funding information (including sources of funding), program overviews, letters from both Co-Chairs, history on the Commission and spending activities. The RFP for the 2007 annual report will go out in June.
Brochure ? The Commission brochure is a short ?snap-shot? of Commission program areas and basic contact information. The current brochure being used was produced in the fall of 2006. There are not plans currently for the production of another brochure.
eNewsletter ? Historically, the Commission provided a newsletter to their distribution list that included a program update for every program. This publication, when printed out, could run in excess of 25 pages in length. In the fall of 2006 the Commission conducted a survey of the readership (which consists of approximately 2,000 subscribers). The results brought the eNewsletter concept to the Commission which will be launched in March 2007 by a contractor. The eNewsletter will be no more than 2-3 pages with the feature story coming from the Denali Commission?s Federal Co-Chair.
Website ? Discussions are underway now to either update the existing website or redesign the website entirely. Accessibility and transparency is a critical concern of the Denali Commission and the website has helped provide information quickly to customers.
Video - Video on the Denali Commission, telling our history, the challenges faced in Alaska and broadly explaining our services. The Commission will be hiring a contractor in the summer of 2007 to update this video for use in various venues.
Booth ? The Denali Commission has a tabletop booth used for various tradeshows and conferences. The message of the booth is communicated through the Denali logo and pictures of various projects from their programs. Handouts of brochures and annual reports are used during booth activities. There are no current plans for updating the existing booth.

<SUBJECT>39 -- Electric Cargo Winch System for CH-53D Aircraft
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-2.3.2.1.1
<RESPDATE>031207
<CONTACT>Erin Alex, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-5259, Fax 301-757-5284, Email Erin.Alex@navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  The following information is provided to assist the United States Navy in conducting a Market Research of Industry to determine potential contractors who have an Electric Cargo Winch System that could be used to support CH-53D Aircraft operations including the offload of vehicles, trailers, and other cargo.  The winch system must meet the following minimum requirements.

The winch system must include two individual electric winches, each having a rated single line pulling capacity not less than 2,000 pounds at a speed not less than 33 feet per minute.  The cable length shall not be less than 98 feet, and the weight of the individual winch shall not exceed 75 pounds.  The two winches must be capable of operating independently or as a matched pair while being controlled from a single pendant.  The system must be operable over a temperature range of -40 degrees to +122 degrees Fahrenheit at altitudes up to 15,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).

The winch system must be compatible with existing aircraft power.  Specifically, the winches shall operate on 115 volt three-phase alternating current at 400 Hz, with not more than 7.5 amperes of current draw per phase while performing at maximum rated capacity.  The controls shall operate on 28 volt direct current at no more than 5 ampere of current.  

The individual winches must be capable of being installed to existing floor-mounted fittings on the left and right sides of the CH-53D cargo compartment.  To be compatible with the existing mounting provisions, it is imperative that the physical dimensions of the new electric cargo winch match the existing footprint of the current hydraulic cargo winch in order to qualify as a mission kit.  Accordingly, the new electric cargo winch shall have the physical dimensions of 10.312 inches wide (side-to-side) by 6.093 inches deep (fore and aft)with a maximum height of 10.76 inches.

The winch system must have the following safety features that are included in the existing hydraulic winch system: (1) emergency stop, (2) redundant limit switches, (3) mechanical fail-safe brake, (4) bi-directional cable tension control, (5) integral control box, (6) safety clutch, and (7) phase lockout relay.

Because the winch system is planned for fielding as a mission kit, the system must be fully removable or installable on an aircraft in approximately 30 minutes.  Since this system is required to support aircraft already operating in austere combat locations, the first six systems shall be delivered to the government not later than six months after contract award.  The Government anticipates a one-time buy of 18 units including all interface and electrical components for installation into the aircraft.
 
The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Any company that would like the Government to consider their existing electric winch for the future procurement of this requirement should express their interest in writing.  Please include a company pamphlet or brochure; a description of the company?s existing cargo winch including specifications, capabilities, and lead time for delivery; and a point of contact including telephone number and address.  Written responses should not exceed 10 typed pages and must be submitted by 12 March 2007, to Naval Air Systems Command, 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, BLDG 2272, Rm. 155, ATTN: Erin Alex, H-53 Program (AIR-2.3.2.1.1), Patuxent River, MD  20670-1547.

<SUBJECT>V -- Resupply Services to McMurdo Station Antarctica
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DACS-USAP-0107
<RESPDATE>013107
<CONTACT>Patricia Williams, Deputy Chief, Contracts Branch, Phone (703) 292-4596, Fax (703) 292-9140/9141, Email pswillia@nsf.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) is managed by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U.S. Government, pursuant to NSC Memorandum 71 (1971) as reaffirmed in Presidential Memorandum 6646 (1982).  PM6646 states: Every effort shall be made to manage the program in a manner that maximizes the cost effectiveness and return on investment.
    
In meeting its responsibilities, NSF arranges for all USAP logistics support activities, including resupply of the year-round U.S. research station at McMurdo.  

In January 2006, NSF sought information regarding the long-term availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the resupply of the USAP?s McMurdo Station. That RFI can be viewed at: 

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DCCA/CPO/DCCA%2D060024/listing.html

NSF now sees merit in seeking information concerning a complete resupply package (for example, mated icebreakers and cargo/fuel supply vessels that can work in close tow configuration.)  

Background 

NSF is interested in contracting for resupply services to McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  These services would involve annually transporting cargo as specified below to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77 deg 51' S, 166 deg 40' E. NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement of at least ten years. It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60 deg S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks, but the operating period may differ with the type of resupply package that is proposed. After that period the vessels would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

The service would deliver fuel, containers and break bulk to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as well as retrograde of materials from McMurdo Station to the U.S or to an acceptable transfer point.  The nominal current annual requirements are identified below and in the attached spreadsheets. 

Fuel (gallons)
o	AN-8 3.5 million
o	JP-5 3.0 million
o	Gasoline 250 thousand

Cargo Delivered
o	Containers (TEU): 600
o	Break Bulk (Pounds): 1.5 million

Cargo Retrograded
o	500 TEU
o	500,000 lbs break bulk

At present, fuel storage (ullage) in McMurdo is such that delivery of the above fuel quantities must be made each year.  However, the USAP plans to increase the ullage such that skipping one year without re-fueling will be possible.  

The container and break-bulk cargo listed in the attached chart includes a considerable amount of cargo dedicated to the re-building of South Pole Station.  It is expected that the volume of delivery will decrease somewhat in coming years.  NSF would consider a proposal for a smaller ship if it could be demonstrated that a double shuttle from a port in the Southern Ocean could be timely and cost-effective.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to open a channel in the sea ice and then to escort cargo and fuel supply vessels using its POLAR class ships. The cargo and fuel delivery vessels have been ice strengthened vessels chartered by the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  The USCG vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life. The MSC vessels are not configured for close coupling with icebreaking vessels configured with a towing notch.  

It is envisioned under this RFI that the icebreaking capability and the resupply ship(s) are all to be offered as one complete, integrated package under direct contract to NSF. 

Partnering arrangements will be welcomed.  For example, it may be that one partner would supply an icebreaker and another would provide the supply ships.

NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c). 

The United States Antarctic Program 

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported in Antarctica by the United States Government. The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research. For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated. U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research. At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities. The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations. 

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station. McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea. It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail. 

Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station. 

Present Schedule and Operations 

The current plan of operation and schedule is provided for information purposes.  Responses to this RFI are not bound to keep within the current mode of operation; in fact respondents are encouraged to review the current operating plans and schedules and to provide innovative suggestions for changes.  

Respondents are encouraged to review the ?Report of the Office of Polar Programs, Office Advisory Committee, subcommittee on U.S. Antarctic Program resupply? for a review of ship resupply and other innovative resupply issues.  This report may be viewed at:
http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jspcntn_id=104354&org=OPP&from=news

Under the current operations, the USCG icebreaker typically arrives at 60 deg S on or about December 25. Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival). The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required .

The freighter used during the 2005/2006 season was the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m). The tanker used was the LAWRENCE GIANELLA, one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/21.2m). Additional information on these vessels may be found at: 
http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp'ship=americantern&type
=ContainerShip 
and 
http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp'ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker. 

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP. The tanker loads at differing ports each year and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16. It departs on or about January 20 each year. The freighter loads at Port Hueneme, California, and Lyttleton, New Zealand, and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year.  It departs on or about February 11. 

Sea Ice 
The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo. It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  For the past five years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound. Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet. The icebergs have moved out of the area since last year.  It is possible that the coming season's ice could start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods. 
A more extensive review of the sea ice conditions may be read at the RFI issued in January 2006 and referenced in the opening paragraph above.  

Evaluation Information 
Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of the proposed resupply package; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted. 

Except as identified herein, no specific format is required. 
Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an icebreaking/resupply package would be: 

o  System economics
o  Performance
o  Reliability
o  Flexibility
o  Marketability (when not on USAP charter). 

It is highly desirable that the vessels proposed have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any refueling from McMurdo. Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this. 

To read more about the fuel available at McMurdo, please read the January 2006 RFI. 

Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation. Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to January 31, 2007, is requested.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT


(1)  GENERAL:  The Department of Commerce is conducting market research in order to determine the capabilities of small businesses to provide services as a prime contractor for the Department of Commerce Financial Management Modernization Project described herein. In order to qualify as a small business, an interested firm must be a small business under NAICS code 541511 and must meet the size standard of $23 million. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 19.102(b), the small business size standard is applied by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) which best describes the principal nature of the product or services being acquired and the associated size standard SBA established for that industry.  FAR 19.102(c) states, for size standard purposes, a product or service shall be classified in only one industry, whose definition best describes the principal nature of the product or service being acquired even though for other purposes it could be classified in more than one. The following websites provide information pertinent to the small business size standard:  http://www.sba.gov/size, http://www.naics.com/sba_sizestandards.htm , and www.arnet.gov/far.   To be considered a small business, your firm must be of a nature which primarily engages in writing, modifying, testing, and supporting software to meet the needs of a particular customer. Information about the NAICS code can be retrieved from the following url:  http://www.naics.com/censusfiles/ND541611.HTM and http://www.naics.com/faq.htm#q1.   The second criteria for being considered a small business is your firm's annual average revenues over the last three years cannot exceed $23 million.  FAR 19.101 provides a definition and circumstances for applying this standard.  In general, annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. For the purpose of this definition, gross revenue of the concern includes revenues from sales of products and services, interest, rents, fees, commissions and/or whatever other sources derived, but less returns and allowances, sales of fixed assets, interaffiliate transactions between a concern and its domestic and foreign affiliates, and taxes collected for remittance (and if due, remitted) to a third party.  The average over the last three years cannot exceed $23 million.


The Department of Commerce is embarking on the next evolutionary stage of its Financial Management.  The Department's strategic vision is aligned with the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) goals of standardization, consolidation and optimization in achieving and sustaining financial management excellence.  Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive financial management modernization initiative focused on deploying the next generation of strategic, process, technology, change management and human performance components.


The original implementation strategy was to allow each bureau to establish unique business rules, implement an instance of the system based on these rules, and run the system on the bureau's server.  Over time, this model has proven inefficient, ineffective, costly, and time-consuming. The new business model, which the Department has already begun to execute by consolidating bureau instances and servers, is intended to address these deficiencies, and allow the Department to achieve the goals of the Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB), including facilitating strong internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other stewardship activities; reducing cost associated with implementing and operating financial management systems; standardizing systems, business processes and data elements and providing seamless data exchange between the Department and other federal agencies.  


In furtherance of this new direction, the Department is considering seeking contractor support for developing a comprehensive strategy and roadmap/blueprint to assess feasibility of analyzing alternative options for financial management support in achieving financial management excellence. This roadmap is anticipated to provide the overarching architecture around standardizing, consolidating and optimizing the Department's business processes, administrative systems and technologies, user interaction and usability, data centers, security and integration components.  This analysis is anticipated to include an assessment of Shared Service Providers capabilities in providing all four categories of service: technology hosting and administration, application management, business process services and system implementation services as outlined in FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance.  The Department is anticipated to undertake the broad scope of process re-engineering, systems implementation and deployment, change management, security management and integration activities necessary to achieve its vision.


As a part of finding and implementing the right solution the Department would require a continuation of current requirements such as both current system maintenance support and overarching support during transition to migrate from its current financial management state to its optimal future state, including all design, architecture, integration, and deployment activities as well as sustaining this future state, including continual business improvements to achieve most efficient organization (MEO) status.  It is critical that the contractor develop, manage, and execute a comprehensive solution that includes maintaining current applications in parallel while performing transition. 


PLEASE NOTE: An interested small business firm which is also a Shared Service Provider or FSIO (JFMIP) Compliant Federal Financial System Vendor would be precluded from offering their software product to the Department of Commerce during any resulting competitive process due to this requirement potentially creating an Organizational Conflict of Interest in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5.


(2) INCUMBENT:  There is no prior contract for the requirements as identified herein.  Some of the services were provided by Systalex Corporation, 1901 Research Blvd, Suite 240, Rockville, Maryland under contract number CM130104CQ0006 which was awarded on July 26, 2004.  Services provided under contract number CM130104CQ0006 included developers, testers, help desk, data warehouse, and Oracle portal services.


(3) ATTACHMENTS:  This announcement contains two attached documents:  Attachment 1 provides instructions on the preparation of a response to this market research and a template for the response; and Attachment 2 is a general description of the system.  Interested small businesses are encouraged to review the attachments thoroughly.  They are also encouraged to activate the email notification feature of FedBizOpps in order to receive notification of any additional postings for this announcement.  In addition to the attached documents, interested firms are encouraged to become familiar with the FSIO website at http://www.fsio.gov/fsio/fsiodata/ in order to understand the requirements of Federal agencies to meet the standards, performance measures, and compliance requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget task force.

     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.

This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Basic Urologicals.  

The approximate annual purchase volume of $217,064 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Basic Urologicals over a one year period.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) year (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) 12 month option periods.  The anticipated award date is 31 June 2007.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the Best Value and trade off criteria.  The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, mail your letter of response by traceable means (i.e. registered mail-return receipt requested or Express Mail Carriers) and provide (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address).  Letters will include vendor responses to the requirement for provision of technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Letters will be mailed to: 

Robert Meinertzhagen
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Responses must be received in writing within two (2) weeks of the closing of this announcement.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

Emails may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil but will not substitute for the above requirement.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Once vendors are notified, a three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Any changes/modifications will be approved by the CPT and all participating vendors will be notified.

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  In addition to the required discounted pricing from DAPA for participating regional commands, vendors should also submit additional tier pricing in the event that they are afforded added volume from standardization commitments from other regions.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be mailed by traceable means (i.e. registered mail-return receipt requested or Express Mail Carriers) to:

Robert Meinertzhagen
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Pricing responses must be received in writing within two (2) weeks from the date of request by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Emails responses may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil but will not substitute for the required written responses.

Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). 

1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability:

<DESC>This is a request for information only.  This request for information is for planning purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Governm ent as a result of the responses to this RFI.  The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding or in any subsequent exchange of information.  All proprietary and restricted information shall b e clearly marked.  All interested sources should provide a product brochure, company literature or information that details their product.  All submissions should include company name, point of contact to include, name, position, telephone number and email  address. All interested parties with significant past performance experience in producing and/or sustaining radar systems are encouraged to respond to this RFI by providing the following information on or before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 16 M arch 2007.  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified and should not exceed 40 pages in length.  All responses shall be transmitted electronically to the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP) at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil, under the Army Pre-Aw ard, C-E LCMC Market Research section, subject as above.   The US Army, PM Radars is seeking sources and information for a lightweight, man-portable weapon location sensor that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and enables accurate detection of mortar locations up to a range of five kilometers.  This sys tems performance is detailed in the LCMR Performance Specification For the LIGHTWEIGHT COUNTER MORTAR RADAR (LCMR), AN/TPQ-48 (V)2 dated 27 January 2007, attached in the Links to Drawings section of the IBOP Market Research Page.  Anyone interested in  reviewing this specification shall forward their company name, address, CAGE code, point of contact to include name, title, telephone number and e-mail address to Joseph Manganaro at joseph.manganaro@us.army.mil or telephonically at 732-427-1389.  Company  information will be verified via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  If youre registered in this database, access to this specification will be granted.  All respondents must be registered in the IBOP system as well.  The Government poss esses no technical data package for the LCMR Program.  Item Definition:  The LCMR is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar, cannon and rocket locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform targ et detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The system consists of an Antenna and Radar Cylinder that is powered by battery or external generator.  Data processing is performed by the Radar Processor (RP), Porta ble Display Unit (R-PDA and/or Laptop).  The LCMR will be located in the Fires Battalion of both the Current and Future Force Units of Action.   The current AN/TPQ-48(V)2 LCMR System is being produced by SRCTec, North Syracuse, NY and has demonstrated the following:  Range and Accuracy Performance in an Actual Environment of 100m TLE (50% CEP) from 1km out to 5km on 60mm, 81mm, 120mm Mortars.  Other considerations:  The Army has a requirement for 640 AN/TPQ-48(V)2 systems; accelerated production that consistently delivers 20 systems per month with minimal or no lead time to the first delivery; a reduced logistics footprint; full technical data r ights; and sustainment and support of all systems (both existing fielded and yet to be fielded).  In addition, the Government needs an antenna solution; currently, the antenna column is a critical issue with availability and maintenance of the systems.   PM Radars is seeking potential respondents who can demonstrate the existing LCMR functionality today.  Schedule is of the utmost importance to PM R adars; therefore, if your firm can demonstrate the existing functionality, can you start delivery of 20 systems per month in 6 months and remain consistent with this delivery quantity?  Is this delivery achievable?  IF NOT, describe in detail your recommen ded schedule and number of systems per month. In addition, PM Radars is seeking sources and information to perform sustainment support for LCMR systems.  LCMR systems are fielded in theater supporting Operation Iraq Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) operations.  The LCMR system shall have a  91% probability that 1 of 2 systems operate failure-free over a 72 hour mission pulse.  Rationale: The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time. The LCMR system shall have a 95% average operational availa bility (Ao).  Rationale: The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time.  The LCMR system operators shall perform 80% of all unscheduled maintenance.   Rationale:  Key to maximizing the system availability a nd increasing self-sufficiency.  The LCMR system shall have a field and sustainment maintenance ratio not to exceed 0.05 maintenance man hours per operating hour.  Rationale:  Ensures that the radar is maintained within the maintenance force structure cons traints.  The LCMR system Maximum Time to Repair at Field Level will not exceed 30 minutes for 90% of the maintenance tasks performed at this maintenance level.  Rationale:  The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with mini mal down time.  Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) may include, but not necessarily be limited to: material and facilities, as well as services, in the following areas:  (1) supply & distribution; (2) maintenance; (3) training; (4) software support; (5) re build/overhaul; (6) repair (CONUS & OCONUS); (7) repair and return (if the unit cannot be repaired OCONUS); (8) modifications/upgrades/updates to hardware/software/firmware and (9) system support.  LCMR maintenance and support will be composed of a mix of Government Logistics Assistance Representatives (LARs) and Contractor Field Service Engineers (FSEs) located at C4ISR Regional Support Centers (RSCs).  The C4ISR RSCs provide direct and integrated general support as well as some limited depot support for o ther systems in OIF/OEF.  It serves as a centralized single face to the field for a broad range of engineering, management, logistics and technical services.  Although the Government will provide these RSC facilities, the Contractor may be required to trav el to remote and hostile areas.  Contractor-provided FSEs shall be co-located and integrated in theater at one or more RSC location (subject to change) in Iraq or Afghanistan. A 2-level maintenance concept at the operational unit (Field) and Echelon Above Unit (EAU) (Depot) levels and ILS CONUS and OCONUS will be implemented.  This shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:  on-site and off-site repairs, 24/7 on call serv ices when a system is returned from the field to include maintenance, product support, shipping, training, documentation and manual updates to the LCMR program.  Any resultant contract will include the requirement to: provide technical support for damaged systems returned from the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems; provide depot level support to include repair parts/field maintenance kits for all LCMR systems; provide FSEs for technical su pport of the system in the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems, and operator guidance and training; provide updated electronic technical documentation sufficient for soldiers to operate, ma intain and train on the equipment in forward areas of the battlefield; document and implement a components and materials obsolescence program and monitor and evaluate electronic part life cycle status and availability on the system design throughout the duration of the contract; provide training and documentation necessary for both Contractor and Government to be able to perform in-theater maintenance above unit level and conduct unit and G overnment LAR training in theater.  Ease of supportability in the field environment is paramount. A wartime operational readiness supportability rate of 99.5% is a requirement.  Repair parts and personnel required to maintain stock levels to meet this read iness requirement is a critical element of any future requirement.  When field failures occur and the Contractor FSE or Government LAR determines that the LCMR cannot be repaired in country, the established turnaround time for CONUS repair is a maximum of thirty (30) days once received at the Contractor CONUS depot to the time the repaired unit is received at the designated CONUS acceptance point.  The established turnaround time for OCONUS repair, once an evaluation indicates an item can be repaired within  country, is twenty-four (24) hours with the item being repaired and returned to the LAR.  Records shall be maintained of all repair/replacement actions detailing inventory of all equipment, returned equipment by name, part number and serial number, mainte nance actions underway, repairs completed, labor hours and categories expended for repairs and repair price/cost of repairs, repair/replacement action taken, why a repair or replacement decision was made, date each item was received for repair, and whether  the item is covered by warranty and the date/time repaired or replaced item was shipped back to the Government.  The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall develop Performance Based Logistics (PBL) metrics by establishing a baseline for the LCMRs  logistics footprint.  All collection of data shall be at the lowest level of detail and allow for visible cost drivers.  The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall complete a Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) or an equivalent model and utilize the results to support a Best Value Business Case Analysis which shall include the following metrics to be measured: A. The Logistics Response Time (LRT) for the LCMR System is defined as the period of time from a logistics demand signal sent to satisfaction o f that logistics demand. This requirement can be provided to the Government via a Technical Discrepancy Report.  B.  The Repair Cycle Time per System failure (the elapsed time from the receipt of a failure item at a repair facility until the time the item is repaired and ready for reissue to the user).  The contractor shall monitor and record the transportation time of a failed LCMR item as a metric and provide this information and any delays beyond the prescribed 96 Hour Turn-Around-Time to the Government.   C. The Stock Availability at Units forward supply level (time to fill a Line Replaceable Unit by the unit s forward supply support).  D.  Maintenance Driven Sub-Elements called Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) (time system is inoperable due to dela y in obtaining maintenance resources.)  E.  The Contractor shall provide accurate data collection process of the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) system information, MANPRINT, spiral development by enhancing BIT/BITE requirements, susta inment training, and personnel.  The contractor shall use the transportation time to move parts as a metrics Packaging Handling Storage and Transportation.  Using an open architecture will aide and lower the footprint by modernization through technology in sertion and sparing.  F. The contractor shall maintain and report LCMR System Life Cycle Sustainment Costs and achieve the optimized System Operational Availability (Ao). Questions/Information Requested:  In providing your response to the sustainment requirements portion of the announcement, please ensure you address the following as well as provide any additional data/information you feel necessary for the Go vernment to assess the availability of suppliers for this level of service.  1. The Government intends to implement a Performance Based Logistics Strategy for this requirement.  Please explain fully how you would implement PBL in a system that has been fie lded.  Please detail performance characteristics you feel are measurable as part of a PBL strategy?  Your response should provide your past PBL accomplishments and the methods and metrics used to develop a support concept to reduce the logistics footprint.   Provide the type of planning your company used to manage the supply chain (Parts Support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating it with the anticipated organic capability and transition.  2. How would you approach this ILS effort? Describe your processes and methodologies to effect the transition from the current ILS provider of (V)1 and (V)2 systems (the OEM, SRCTec, Inc.).  3. Describe how you would partner with a U. S. Army organic element to satisfy the Armys long range goal of  depot capability for all repair and return and inventory management efforts for the LCMR System.  This capability has not been incorporated to date.  Please detail your approach to involving a depot, identifying how you would engulf them into the processe s and provide a reasonable timeline to transition 100% repair and return and inventory management functions to that depot.  4. To accomplish the Governments requirements outlined in this announcement is there anything you feel the Government must provide to make it happen?  Points of contact:  Contracting Officer: Linda A.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH, PM Aerial Common Sensor, W15P7T-07-R-W401.   The Airborne Reconnaissance Multi-Sensor Systems (ARMS) were developed and fielded under a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC).  Project Manager Aerial Common Sensors (PM ACS), in conjunction with the C4IEWS Acquisition Center, Fort Monmouth, NJ, is seeking information from potential sources to support the potential solicitation and award of a competitive multi-year Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services contract to assist the Army in meet ing deployed operational and training needs, with direct responsibilities for the performance of all logistic actions ensuring a ninety percent operational availability of the TS/SCI Airborne Mission Equipment Subsystem (AMES) hardware and software aboard eleven ARMS (RC-12) aircraft. AMES is a software controlled, integrated array of electronic sensors, antennae, real time imagery (Infra Red, Day-Time video, and electro-optic still cameras), data links, data recording, navigation, voice and data communicat ions and data links, managed through the use of manned workstations.  This requirement also sustains the Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) mounted on the aircraft, but not the aircraft themselves.  Sustainment includes but is not limited to the expedi ted troubleshooting, isolation and repair of unit reported faults through adjustments, alignments, repair or replacement of failed parts with specification compliant parts procured by the CLS contractor.  While upgrades to the AMES are not anticipated unde r a potential contract, configuration management and engineering expertise to overcome parts obsolescence are required.  Pre-mission, mission and post-mission assistance are required to support maximized mission effectiveness as well as contractor performa nce of informal on-the-job training for assigned unit personnel and formal training for ARMS personnel assigned to the unit after the start of the contract.  A Technical Data Package, suitable to support the potential contract performance, is a deliverable  on a current contract.  A full technical data package is to be available on items developed at Government expense, and commercial information as normally accompanies Commercial Off-The-Shelf items will also be made available upon request following the pos ting of a subsequent contract solicitation. Contractors with well established Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance expertise, at the TS/SCI level, in the operation, training, maintenance, and supply support areas of excellence are invited to submit information regarding company capabili ties, past performance, and factors relating to the operation and sustainment of systems like AMES. This research is for the purpose of obtaining information only.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this market research.

<DESC>A.	 General Information      TRICARE Pacific Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation  (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Monitoring Electrodes. The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Suppo rt Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.      This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is  December 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.     Point of Contact Susan Hwang, 808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Monitoring Electrodes. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $91,059.00. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information,  and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the decision makers for thi s initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to particip ate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert like one to five rating scale. One is equal to not acceptable and five i s equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further co nsideration in the standardization process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the  MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 year s).  1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: 1.	Does your company manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Monitoring Electrodes? 2.	Are your products available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health? 3.	What is your DAPA number for this product line? 4.	Under what brand(s) does your company manufacture or distribute your product? 5.	Under what standards is your product manufactured? 6.	Under what regulatory and/or advisory agency are your products classified? Are your products approved by these agencies? 7.	Please provide a list of the products your company offers for this product line. 8.	Are your products latex free? 9.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only. The U.S. Department of the Army, Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), is seeking information on large scale solid state mass storage devices that meet the requirements outlined below .  Specifically, the goal of this synopsis is to identify companies with mature systems or the ability to rapidly mature systems which support high speed collection, formatting, processing and non-volatile storage of data (GPS, INS, metadata, imagery, rada r, other) with capacities exceeding 10 Terabytes.  The types of memory components currently under consideration are D-RAM, S-RAM and NAND Flash memory.  The preference is toward true non-volatile technology such as NAND flash, however responses can include other technologies so long as it can be shown that  they are of sufficient maturity, capability and availability to meet all requirements.  Upon the conclusion of this announcement, the Government plans on reviewing the responses according to capability, effectiveness (performance), maturity, complexity, c ost and deploy ability (to include maintainability, reliability, and ability to be used on either or both fixed wing and/or rotary types of platforms).   It is possible that multiple responses may contain similar approaches.  We request that sources capable of meeting the Government's technical requirements provide detailed information about its products. In order to allow a more consistent review of the re sponses, the following response format is recommended:  1) Technology Description  What memory technology is used in the Solid State Memory System and the principles of operation ; 2) System Description  What comprises the system prototype/final system f rom a hardware standpoint (size, weight, location) and interface requirements (power, data) and what existing equipment is available; Limitations, technical risks and requirements that cannot be met should also be addressed. 3) Maturity Level  The ability  of the system to meet the maturity requirement and how the ability was assessed; 4) Cost of Implementation  ROM costs and schedule for design and development of an initial prototype for production system in the 10 to 100 Terabyte range. Respondees should  also address pricing for production of additional units in quantities of less than ten; and 5) Deployability  What technical or maintainability, or reliability limitations that would effect the deployment of this system on an airborne platform.

<SUBJECT>D -- Broad Agency Announcement - Notification of AF ISR Solutions Call for Concept
<DESC>******THIS ANNOUNCEMENT COINCIDES WITH PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT #FA7014-07-C2-INDAY**********

Notification of AF ISR Solutions Call for Concepts

1.  With completion of the ISR Functional Area Analysis (FAA) and Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), the third phase of AF capability-based planning the ISR Functional Solution Analysis (FSA) has commenced.  The Combined C2/ISR Functional Solutions Call/Industry Day (10-11 Jan), attended by many of you, signaled the beginning of the FSA.  We request your participation in the AF FY10 ISR FSA process. As promised at the close of the forum, we have loaded all ISR Needs into our I-CAST data base and are now soliciting ISR DOTMLP-F solution concepts addressing the prioritized ISR needs documented in the FNA.  We have, in cooperation with AFMC/A2, developed non-materiel and materiel solution concept forms (Atch 1 & 2), with associated instructions (Atch 3 & 4) that will be used by providers to submit their solution concepts.  Please heed the guidance to limit the length of any supporting white papers, etc. to no more than four pages, and the mandatory requirement to include a quad chart (Atch 5 for materiel solutions only) as part of the submission process.  The suspense date for ISR solution concepts submission is 20 Apr 07.  The extended deadline is intended to accommodate those industry solution providers who must wait to receive the classified ISR shortfall data via mail.  The ISR Solution Analysis IPT (SAIPT) will meet approximately 45 days later to evaluate submitted solutions.  Request you review the prioritized ISR capability Needs and submit materiel and/or non-materiel solution concepts by the above suspense date. 
2. For those with SIPRNET access, the ISR Needs will be available on SIPRNET at: https://afc2isrc.af.smil.mil.  You will need to select I-CAST under the ISR Requirements toolset to gain access to the ISR information.  Once there, you will see two selection boxes.  If you want to view and submit solution proposals you will need to apply for an I-CAST Write Access account.  If you wish to review/read the ISR needs, you do not need write access.  If you submit for write access, it will be adjudicated within 48 hours.  You must await your approved access in order to submit solution proposals via SIPRNET.  To read ISR Needs simply click on View FY10 ISR Needs/Submit Solution Proposal and then select the area of the Capabilities and Task List (CTL) in which you are interested.  To submit a proposal, select a needs statement for review. On the top and bottom of each needs form will be the phrase Submit Solution Proposal for this Need Statement.  Selecting this link will take you to the required template to be filled out and submitted.  Note: there is no provision for the direct submission/acceptance of Quad Charts (required for materiel solutions) on I-CAST.  Therefore, the last item on the I-CAST template will automatically direct the provider to the AFC2ISRC/A2X organizational mailbox, where Quad Chart and other supporting materials may be sent. Additionally, the complete Functional Needs Analysis (FNA) Draft Report will be available for review/reference NLT mid-February.
3.  For those without .mil accessibility, you may request a classified CD of the Needs, solutions templates, and instructions by providing your name, company, address, phone number, and CAGE code to Mr. Marc Smith, AFMC/A2, at:  Marc.Smith2@wpafb.af.mil. Classified solutions may be submitted via I-CAST (noted above), or in a CD via registered mail.  In this case the outer envelope should be addressed to AFC2ISRC, 300 Exploration Way, Hampton VA, 23666.  The inner envelope should be addressed to AFC2ISRC / A2X, Attn: TSgt Michael Young. Unclassified solutions concept may be submitted via NIPRNET E-mail to Maj Shannon Bouvier, Mr. Dade Phillips, or Mr. Larry Snider (see addresses below). Alternatively, unclassified CDs may be submitted to: AFC2ISRC/A2X, 300 Exploration Way, Hampton VA, 23666, Attn: TSgt Michael Young. 
4.  The submission of ISR Solutions Concepts is totally voluntary and in no way obligates the government to award any contracts or pay any cost associated with such participation.
5.  POCs for further questions or information are Maj Shannon Bouvier, DSN 575-4295 or (757) 225-4295, shannon.bouvier@langley.af.mil ; Mr. Dade Phillips, DSN 575-1336 or (757) 225-1336, dade.phillips.ctr@langley.af.mil ; or Mr. Larry Snider, DSN 575-4239, or (757) 225-4239, larry.snider.ctr@langley.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Technology Insertion (TI) 2008
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (GSA-FAS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this notice to inform industry that an initial Request For Quotation (Phase I), for the Technology Insertion FY08 (TI-08) will be issued on or about April 20, 2007.  Issuance of a final RFQ (Phase II) is anticipated on or about September 24, 2007.  Phase I of the RFQ will be issued primarily to determine general pricing, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks) and related HPC functional capabilities for HPC systems that are deliverable on or before July 2008.  Phase II of the RFQ will request offerors to provided detailed pricing, configuration, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks), maintenance, and delivery information for one or more specific HPC system configurations to significantly improve the DoDs HPC capability and capacity.  The application benchmark codes that are anticipated to be included in the TI-08 application benchmark suite are recognized by the following names: CTH, HYCOM, GAMESS, AVUS and OOCORE.  Benchmarks that can optionally be executed and submitted as supplemental information to Government predicted performance estimates include ICEPIC, LAMMPS, Overflow-2, WRF and AMR.  See a related FedBizOpps announcement for an invitation to a March 1, 2007 information-exchange workshop to discuss the methods the Government intends to use for Government predicted benchmark performance.  <p>

Responses to the RFQ will only be considered from original equipment manufacturers who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services; (2)  have demonstrated the sustainment of a commercially available HPC systems product line with success in large scale manufacturing, deployment and maintenance of commercially available, production HPC systems; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.  Furthermore, the Government financial appropriations associated with this acquisition do not permit the purchase of any supercomputer which is not manufactured in the United States.  Interested vendors are required to submit a NTE 10 page paper providing evidence of their ability to meet the above requirements to Ms. April OConnor at april.oconnor@gsa.gov by COB March 23, 2007.  In cases where the vendor is acquiring substantial portions of a potentially offered system from third party suppliers, please be specific in justifying your role as an OEM with a sustainable HPC product line versus, for example; a reseller, an assembler or an integrator of HPC systems.  An evaluation of the information submitted will be conducted and letters of eligibility will be distributed to qualified vendors by April 13, 2007.  An information briefing will be offered to pre-qualified vendors.  The briefing is currently scheduled for the morning of May 3, 2007 beginning at 9:00AM EDT and will be followed by vendor-specific, one-on-one information exchange meetings and question and answer sessions individually scheduled for the afternoon of May 3 and, as needed, on May 4 to host all qualified vendors.  Each vendor will be allowed 30 minutes for their May 3 or May 4 one-on-one session.   For more details about the HPCM Program visit the website at www.hpcmo.hpc.mil. Questions can be submitted to GSA at any time during the RFQ process.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation.

I	Description of Requirement.

Federal agencies relocating to the new Federal building, 90 Seventh St., San Francisco, CA  94103, have a requirement for satellite TV service. The Federal building is near completion and agencies are scheduled to begin moving into the building in March 2007. 

The building consists of two structures: an eighteen-story tower with raised floors and a four-story conventional building. The building (both structures) is supported by a standard cable infrastructure with two identical IDF closets on each floor.  All horizontal cable in the building is Cat 5E.  The design of the tower portion of the building is designed as a green building. There is very limited space in the existing conduits to support the installation of horizontal coaxial cable. Therefore, the contractor must use existing, Government-furnished, Cat 5E to connect to the end device. 

At this time, there is no TV service to each floor and to the office spaces. Therefore, this requirement consists of delivering satellite TV service from the commercial carrier to the various agencies throughout the building.

	1. Deliver satellite TV service to approximately 50 users using existing, Government-furnished Cat 5E cable.

	2. Install Cat 5E distribution hubs (equal to or better than Endeleo brand) and terminate on Government-furnished Cat 5E jacks on the customers' Cat 5E patch panel, Data Two jack, unless specified differently by the agency.

	3. Provide and install all equipment and cabling in accordance with industry specifications.

	4. Provide, at a minimum, the following 12 channels:

1	        KTVU (2) - Independent FOX; 
2	        KNTV (11) - NBC San Jose; 
3	        KPIX (5) - CBS San Francisco; 
4	        KGO (7) - ABC San Francisco; 
5	        Weather Channel; 
6	        Bloomberg; 
7	        Fox News Channel; 
8	        CNBC; 
9	        MSNBC; 
10	        CNN; 
11	        CSPAN-1; 
12	        CSPAN-2. 

	5. Complete all work no later than March 31, 2007.

II	Instructions for submission of quote.

	1. Itemize all equipment, quantities, unit prices, and amounts. 

	2. Provide the title of each labor category, number of hours, hourly rate, and amount.

	3. Describe the sequence of work that will be performed from start to completion. Providing a milestone schedule is desirable.

	4. Provide three references for similar work completed within the past two years, including contract number, brief description of the work, name and telephone number of the point of contact, and name and address of the work location.

III.	Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation of offers will be based on three factors: technical description, including items offered; past performance; and price. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must clearly demonstrate the firm is capable of performing the required work and completing it on or before March 31, 2007.

IV	Method of Award

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

V	Government Points of Contact

Any questions of a technical nature or requests for site visits should be directed to Mr. John Archdeacon at (415) 522-4530 or via e-mail at john.archdeacon@gsa.gov. All other questions or concerns should be directed to Jo Ann Lew at (415) 522-4550 or via e-mail at joann.lew@gsa.gov.

VI	Due Date for Receipt of Quotes

The Coast Guard intends to procure the services from Converteam, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2404 (a)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Converteam (formerly Alstom Power Conversion, inc.) is the original equipment manufacturer/integrator of the IPP.  The Healy is currently home ported in Seattle, WA. The maintenance support contractor shall be required to maintain a quality program that complies with ISO-9001.  The technical consultant must have at least 5 years hands-on experience in the troubleshooting, repair and performance of preventative and corrective maintenance on equipment of similar size and service to the Converteam equipment currently installed on the USCGC HEALY.  The Coast Guard anticipates a four month contract to bridge a gap between other support contracts.  

It is the Government's belief that only Converteam, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)/Integrator, can provide the support required.  The Government does not own the technical documentation or software code needed to conduct a competitive procurement.   This is a contract to the OEM for support services, as the developer and proprietor of the Machinery Plant Control and Monitoring System (MPCMS) software that enable integration of the IPP components, Converteam, is the only known source with access to the software code to maintain the system.  All responsible sources are encouraged to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Other potential sources must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence of at least five years experience/work on Converteam control systems with features/capability comparable to the system to be supported.  This experience may be in system design, operation, maintenance, and training or in any combination of these four specialties.  They must be intimately familiar with all components of the HEALY systems list and their function.  Interested parties must provide proof of access to Converteam proprietary technical documentation on systems hardware and software.  Parties must also demonstrate the capability of accessing the ship's MPCMS/CTES from a remote shore site and extracting data from MPCMS/CTES databases for analysis and troubleshooting.  In the absence of responses for firms, which believe they have the capability to perform this requirement, the Coast Guard intends to negotiate with Converteam Inc. for the work described pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency.  No other notice will be published until award is made.  Address all correspondence to : USCG, NESU  Seattle, Attn: G. M. Wing, 1519 Alaskan Way S Bldg 3, Seattle, WA  98034.  See Numbered Note 22.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE ? NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).    Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.    Informal forum with the Ombudsman.    Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-AP01), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

C1.	Background
Facility Services (FACS) is responsible for planning and designing current and future space needs for the Library of Congress (LOC).  FACS also develops and implements Library policy governing the structural, mechanical and custodial care of Library buildings.   Presently, FACS is responsible for maintaining and managing the buildings on the LOC Capitol Hill Campus which is comprised of The James Madison Memorial Building (1,900,000 SF), The John Adams Building (760,000 SF), and The Thomas Jefferson Building (660,000 SF), as well as The Landover Center Annex, (246,100SF), The Taylor Street Annex (88,630SF), St Cecelia?s Special Facility (39,662SF), FT. Meade Book Storage Modules (335,000SF) and NAVCC in Culpeper VA (420,000SF).  Facility Design and Construction (FD&C), as a unit of FACS performs the space planning, interior design and furnishing of all Library facilities.  Additionally, construction management is executed in conjunction with the Architect of the Capitol (AOC).   Projects managed by FD&C range in scope from the design of a secured collections storage facility to the refurbishing of a reading room to the renovation of a training center. Given the breadth of scope of work managed by FD&C, contract services must be delivered in a manner that speaks to the dynamic and comprehensive nature of FD&C?s service requirements.
C2.	Scope

	The intent of this solicitation is to obtain furniture repair, reupholstery and refinishing services for the LOC facilities located on Capitol Hill.  Services will be requested on an as needed basis.. 

C3.	Requirements
	
	The selected contractor will provide furniture installation and repair services.  FD&C will issue a Request for Quote for each task.  Submitted quotes will require a Request for Service and approval by the COTR.  These services are to include repair of systems furniture, wood furniture, antiques, as well as various furniture that is part of the LOC standard  and non-standard inventory.

A.	Kick Off Meeting:  The contractor will meet with the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR), and designated LOC contacts to review the program objectives, roles and responsibilities

B.	Review Meetings:  The contractor will meet regularly and on request with the COTR, to review and confirm the status of the services.  The contractor will maintain project documentation, including critical path alerts, action items, briefings and meeting minutes.

D.	Contractor Personnel:  Contractor will assign a single project manager who will participate and maintain oversight from project start to finish.  Contractor will provide resumes, professional credentials and certification of all persons assigned to the contract.  Personnel provided under this contract shall not be pending charges, shall not have been convicted of any felony within the last 10 years or any misdemeanor within the last five years (excepting minor motor vehicle infractions for which the individual paid a fine or posted collateral in the amount of $300 or less) which would indicate violent or disruptive conduct, dishonest conduct, untrustworthiness or unreliability which could reasonably affect performance on the contract or pose a security concern with respect to access to Library buildings or grounds, property or collections.  Note that the term ?convicted? would include a disposition of ?probation? or ?probation before judgment.?  Should any person employed by the contractor to perform work under this contract be convicted of any of the aforesaid offenses, the contractor agrees to remove the individual from the contract performance and return all Library building and stack passes issued to the individual.  The contractor also agrees to remove from the contract performance, any individual under pending charges for any felony or misdemeanor with exceptions noted above until such time as the final disposition is known.  Upon request of the Library, the contractor will identify personnel to be assigned to work under the contract and submit a FD-258 (contractor fingerprint chart) and any other necessary administrative forms provided by the Library so that a background check may be conducted.  The parties agree that the Library has final authority to determine the suitability of contractor personnel who perform work under this contract.  Nevertheless, the fact that the Library may conduct background checks on assigned contractor personnel does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide qualified, reliable personnel of sound character and conduct.

PLEASE NOTE: THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S SITE MUST BE WITHIN 50 MILES OF QUANTICO, VA HAS BEEN DELETED. Question #2: About 1 ? years ago, CISCO made the CCNA exam a lot harder and we went to 6 days of training, Monday thru Saturday, with Monday thru Friday being 10-12 hour days to make sure pass rates stay high. Can the training be 6 days? Answer #2: Yes. Question #3: In this solicitation, you state, ?When completed, attendee shall be certified.? Do you mean that we should issue them a ?Certificate of Completion,? or are you referencing to an official CISCO certification? We can certainly deliver the exams, but no one can guarantee certification since some students may not have the intellectual capacity to pass the exams. Answer #3: We are referencing an official CISCO certification. The FBI understands that there is no CISCO certification if the student does not pass the exam. Question #4: The boot camp training classes must be exclusive to FBI personnel or can we receive them in one of our already scheduled, and opened to a max of 10 students? Answer #4: The boot camp training classes do not have to be exclusive to FBI personnel.

Answer #5: In accordance with RFQ-0276309, minimum class size would be 3 and the largest class size would be 10 during Fiscal Year 2007. Question #6: Could you please give us a basic idea about the desired schedule? Answer #6: The FBI wishes to keep the schedule flexible.  There will be two classes sometime during Fiscal Year 2007. Question #7: Is this a new requirement?  If not, who is the incumbent? Answer #7: This is a new requirement. Question #8: What on-line Reps and Certs have to be submitted with the RFQ? Answer #8: The following Federal Acquisition Regulation Provisions are listed in ORCA: 52.203-2 ? Certificate of Independent Price Determination, 52.203-11 ?

Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software.  PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR DUNS NUMBER WITH YOUR QUOTE. Question #9: Can instructor resume and certifications be sent as a separate attachment since the quotation is limited to 5 pages only? Answer #9: Yes. Question #10: Do you require a single per student price to cover all possible quantities of students the solicitation suggests? We would prefer to provide a sliding scale that provides for decreasing student class as student count per class increase. Answer #10: You can propose an alternate price schedule; however, you must submit a price schedule in accordance with the requirements in the solicitation.

Question 1: In Section 4.2.19 a caution plate triangle is required.  Is this to be permanently affixed to the back of truck, or are they requesting a folding style that stores behind the seat?

Answer 2: Bolivia.  See paragraph 2.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.

Answer 3:  No.  Payment will be made in accordance with paragraph 3.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.

cover? (Manufacturer's warranty is only going to cover so much, and it may not even be valid in Bolivia).
Answer 4: The warranty must be valid in Bolivia.  See paragraph 1.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.

Question 3: Considering the ongoing and anticipated build-up of forces at Fort Bliss as the result of BRAC actions, will the requirements for this . . .Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (COCO) laundry service . . ., be such to include the additional requirements of the Fort Bliss mission consistent with the mission? Answer 3:   Because this is a requirements contract, the Government can only estimate the amount of the supplies or services specified in the Schedule.  For further information, refer to FAR 52.216-21, Requirements, included in the contract.   1.	At Section C.1 of the PWS, is the following statement, This contract includes all functions, tasks and responsibilities normally performed by a Laundry Operator to include a tailor and patch service. Question 4: Are the requirements for these services limited to those clearly defined in the PWS, or in the alternative, are there other  . . . functions, tasks and responsibilities . . . anticipated by the terms and conditions of the solicitation that ar e merely implied and not clearly defined in the language of the solicitation? If so, please provide more specific data. Answer 4:  Other  . . . functions, tasks and responsibilities . . . anticipated by the terms and conditions of the solicitation that are merely implied and not  clearly defined in the language of the solicitation will include the normal repairing of items performed by a commercial laundry operator that are listed on the announcement, following the guidelines set in section C.9.1.   2.	At Section C.4.1, is the following statement, The Contractor shall also establish and maintain a bench stock consisting of common materials and items of nominal value used in operating a tailor activity necessary to perform the requirement of this cont ract. QUESTION 5: Please provide a clear and unambiguous definition of  . . . a tailor activity . . ., and additionally, those  . . . materials and items . . . which would be anticipated by the terms and conditions of the solicitation that would be required. Answer 5:  For the purposes of this contract, the definition of a tailor activity can include functions such as measuring, cutting, sewing, pinning, embroidery, etc., for the purpose of producing the result desired.  In Sections C.8.7. Sewing Services and C.9., sewing requirements are described in more detail.  Also, the materials and items required to maintain a bench stock to perform the sewing services must include thread, webbing/tape, embroidery thread, an embroidery machine, sewing machine, sewing pin s and needles, etc.      3.	At Section C.4.2, is the following statement, The contractor shall provide a total of fourteen carts to prevent any clean/soiled items from being stored on the floor. QUESTION 6: Referencing the  . . . fourteen cars . . . made part of the solicitation, will said carts and the design and specifications of same be under the control of the contractor, the government, or as a joint agreement between the parties? Answer 6:  See C.5.1., the specifications of the carts are 30W x  42 L x 32 Deep, made  with heavy duty canvas.  The contractor will provide the carts and the carts will be under the control of the contractor. 4.	At Section C.4.2, is the following statement, These carts shall be delivered on or before the start date of the contract and in coordination with the COR to building 2031. QUESTION 7: What is the anticipated start date of the contract, and how much time prior to the start date of the contract will be available to perform the referenced requirements of the contract? Answer 7:  The performance start date of the contract is 1 May 2007.  Anticipated award date is 26 April 2007. 5.	At Section C.5.1, is the following statement, Sewing services for mobilizing personnel with orders shall be completed within two (2) workdays. For non-mobilizing personnel, sewing services shall be completed within four (4) workdays. QUESTION 8: Please define the phrase  . . .sewing services . . . as is used in this part of the contract. Additionally, does this requirement of the contract anticipate pickup and delivery independent of the established pick-up and delivery schedule as s et forth in the contract? Answer 8:   Sewing services are amended in the PWS, specifically section C. 8.7.1. to include repair of items.  In addition, there will only be a 3-day completion requirement, that will follow the pick-up and delivery schedule that will not be independent of the established schedule set forth, see amended PWS. 6.	At Section C.8.1, is the following statement, All items shall be plastic wrapped in bundles designated by label by customer. QUESTION 9: There are clear and apparent contradictions to this statement within the PWS, specifically Section/s C.9.5, C.8.5.9, C.8.5.9.1, C.8.5.9.2,C.8.5.9.3, thus, would you provide the controlling language as would apply this aspect of the contract? Answer 9:  All sections should say plastic wrapped.  The instructions are still applicable, however, the final product would require plastic wrapped. 7.	At Section C.8.6.1, is the following statement, The Contractor shall operate a mobile laundry pick-up and delivery service to buildings listed in Section C.8.1. Items picked-up or delivered wi ll be loaded or off loaded by the Contractor to and from the service points. QUESTION 10: The language of the PWS in this area makes reference to . . .buildings . . ., though Section C.8.1 makes reference to only one building, and further reference is made to  . . . service points . . .. Simply, is this a grammatical error with in the PWS, or in the alternative, is it the intention of the government that more than one building or service point is contemplated under the terms and conditions of the contract? Answer 10:  It is the intention of the government that more than one building or service point is contemplated under the terms and conditions of the contract, see Technical Exhibit 1 for explanation of additional locations to be added at a future date. 8.	At Section C.9.1, is the following statement, The Contractor shall repair or patch holes, rips, tears, one inch (1) in diameter or less. QUESTION 11: Are the  . . . repair or patch . . . functions as described at this part of the PWS considered part of the Total of Sewing services per Year, as set forth in Technical Exhibit 2, or would this work be in addition to the referenced servi ces? If so, would there be any line item within the contract for compensation of the contractor for these services that are not within the scope of Laundering? Answer 11:  The repair/patch functions are in addition to the sewing services required by the contract.  Sewing services for repair are anticipated, however, an estimate cannot be determined.   Other questions are answered as follows: Question A:  Request for a standard form 1449 and a list of everything that needs to be included in the packet for submittal.   Answer A:  The combined synopsis/solicitation advertised in the Fed Biz Ops constitutes the solicitation.  Everything that needs to be submitted is described therein.

Answer B:  The last sentence in section C.8.6.1., The Contractor shall adequately staff the service vehicle so that customers will not be required to wait more than 20 minutes for pick-up and delivery service is removed in its entirety.  Reference Techni cal Exhibit 1, pick-up and delivery will be 2 weekdays per week, Monday and Thursday.
