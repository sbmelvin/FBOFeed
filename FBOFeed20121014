2.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

The Board will evaluate where appropriate the effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure; coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will also be examined. 
3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  A board will consider a firm's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work in the required time. The board will consider the full potential value of any current A/E contracts that a firm has been awarded when evaluating capacity.
4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Information obtained for Government Past Performance Information Systems may be accessed and utilized in the evaluation process.
5.	Location in general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Examples of knowledge of the locality include knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  
6.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
7.	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

This is in order to assure compliance with FAR Clause 52.219-14(b)(1) Limitations on Subcontracting.  Failure to provide this information will deem the Firm as nonresponsive and preclude SF 330 submittal from being included in the evaluation process.

Information Used by Boards.  Boards will only consider the following information: SF330 Parts I and II; any required supplemental information; documented performance evaluations. A board will not assume qualifications which are not clearly stated in a firm's submission.  A board will review the entire submission of each firm and not excerpts or summaries.

<DESC>Here are some more answers to questions.
<p>Coil count specified is the minimum.</p>
<p>A firm mattress with plush top is what the customer is looking for.</p>
<p>there is not a thickness requirment, but it must have all the required specifications and be able to be used in a bunk bed setup.</p>
<p>If the bed frames are frames only that can be bolted together than no assembly is required by the contractor, if the ends (foot board and headboard) are comprised of a lot of little pieces than they will need to be built before being brought here so minimal assembly is required by customer.</p>
