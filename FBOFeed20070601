<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Foundation for Earth Science, Boyce, VA to provide support services in coordination with National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS) offices and centers and the Federation for Earth Science Information Partners (Federation) for semi-annual meetings, technical committee initiatives, and portal development activities.  Particular emphasis will be placed upon positioning the Federation to support the U. S. Group on Earth Observations (USGEO) Architecture and Data Management Working Group (ADM) with the objective of developing a test bed for initiatives aimed at moving toward the system-of-systems capability envisioned in the Strategic Plan for the U. S. Integrated Earth Observing System.  The Federation will work with NOAA?s National Data Centers to develop and jointly host a user workshop, co-located with one of the Federation?s semi-annual meetings, aimed at better defining user requirements and generating new users for NESDIS products and services.  The Federation will continue to assist the National Climatic Data Center in the development of the U.S. Drought Portal and other major earth observing agencies to improve metadata standards and profiles.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because of the Federation?s national role in the acquisition, storage and processing of earth observation information and its unique mix of participating organizations provides a neutral forum for interaction and exchange of ideas.  The Foundation for Earth Science is a private, non-profit corporation established by the members of the Federation to provide support services to the Federation and its operating committees, which makes them uniquely qualified to provide the required services.  They are the only known source with the technical expertise and network of relationships required to provide the required services.  The period of performance shall be from September 1, 2007 through August 31, 2008 with option provisions for two additional one-year periods.  A cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to meet NOAA?s requirement by June 15, 2007.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  The applicable NAICS is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.

Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.tsa.gov/public/display?theme=84&content=090005198001349.  The provisions of 
3.2.2.5-1 Instructions to Offerors ?Commercial Items (August 2002) and the clauses 3.2.2.5-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (February  2003) and 3.2.2.5-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (August 2002) apply to this acquisition

In accordance with 3.2.2.5-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, offerors are advised that the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offer whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on best value criteria, price, timeliness, and other factors considered.  The factors listed below will be used to evaluate offers:

A.	Compatibility with existing software.  Contractor?s proposed service shall provide raw data to be compatible with existing software (i.e. SSIM format).  Contractors will be required to provide test data, if requested by TSA, to allow TSA to conduct the necessary testing to ensure compatibility.  Any offering found to be incompatible with existing software will be ineligible for award.

B.	Past Performance.  Proposals shall provide a minimum of two (2) past performance references for contract services the offeror has provided which are similar in size and scope to this requirement.  Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service provided.  When evaluating the factor, the Government will assign greater value to experience which is most directly related to the current requirement and for which customer references provide positive past performance reports which attest to their satisfaction with the offerors support.  

C.	Completeness of Airline Schedule Coverage.   Proposals shall detail the number and title of airlines included to illustrate the completeness of airline schedule coverage, inclusive of all US Flag.  This should include a list of the schedule data that would be provided, as documented in SSIM Chapters and Appendices, such as airline names, flight numbers, departure/arrival cities, dates/times of flight sectors covered as well as the average number of schedule changes handled per month.  Also included in this section shall be a discussion of resources available for the collection, validation and management of flight schedules and related flight input.  This discussion shall include the identification of any resources that will be exclusively dedicated to support of  TSA..  When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals exhibiting the greatest breadth of airline schedule coverage, inclusive of schedules being rapidly available without time delay, as well as the availability of the greatest amount of resources to address the current FAMS requirements (to include exclusively dedicated resources).  Carrier must include domestic and international routing.

D.	Minimum performance requirements include:

1.	Operational IT support shall be provided which can be reached 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, via an Internet address or a toll free telephone number.
2.	Verbal notification of airline reporting error shall occur within 2 hours of discovery (independent and proactively verify accuracy of schedules based on corporate expertise and knowledge and provide immediate personal notification upon recognition of possible error).
3.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to deliver an ad hoc load should FAMS determine an additional mid cycle load is required.   Pricing for ad hoc loads shall be proposed on a per occurrence basis, separate from other pricing.
4.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to deliver a weekly report listing changes for each load (e.g. new airlines).  It is important that weekly reports reflect items such as new aircraft, new airlines, airline closures and new city pair routes, etc.
5.	Proposals shall specify a firm delivery date for each load and detail a notification procedure that will be followed if it is anticipated that delivery will be delayed for any reason. When delays are experienced, FAMS shall be given priority when correcting any delivery delays.


When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals which not only meet all minimum requirements, but which also exceed the Government?s requirements by offering additional benefits in a cost beneficial manner.

E.	Pricing.  Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a 1 year base period and four (4) one year options in increments of 12 month period.  Offerors shall assume the first date of service will be that of July 29, 2007.  Pricing shall be broken down by weekly costs based upon 52 weeks of service.  The weekly price shall be itemized to clearly show all components/services that are covered by the weekly price, to include the pricing for each of those components/services.  The itemized list provided shall clearly show how the total weekly price is derived.  Additionally, offerors shall provide a separate price for ad hoc loads which the Government may order on a per occurrence basis.  Finally, the offeror shall also provide pricing for four (4) additional 12-month option periods (2008-2012) in the format just described.


Evaluation factors in descending order of importance are compatibility with existing software, past performance, completeness of airline schedule coverage (without time delay), satisfaction of minimum performance requirements, and price.  Technical evaluation factors when combined are more important than price.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:  Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contracto!  r Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Num ber (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on Orcas homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.

<DESC>The Bacteriology and Mycology Branch (BMB), Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking contractors interested in advancing the field of contemporary clinical laboratory diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA).  DMID intends to solicit this project under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about May 4, 2007, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.75 total FTEs.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious fungal infections are high priorities of the NIAID.  Systemic fungal infections are a significant health problem in immunocompetent hosts (the endemic mycoses) and immunocompromised hosts (the opportunistic mycoses in addition to the endemic mycoses). The burden of invasive fungal disease in the U.S. has shifted from the community to the hospital base. These are recognized as important emerging infectious diseases, especially in nosocomial settings involving the management of bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients, neutropenic cancer patients, and surgical, trauma and critical care patients.  Fungi cause approximately ten percent of nosocomial bloodstream infections.  This contract will link the appropriate clinical specimens (blood, urine, etc.) from subjects at risk for IA and potentially interfering medical conditions to currently available and experimental laboratory tests for the purposes of diagnostic proof of principle, test comparison, and evaluation of the effect of potentially interfering medical conditions (pathologies/interventions), unrelated to IA, on the performance of the diagnostic test.  It is expected that these goals be achieved through the establishment and maintenance of a repository of clinical samples from patients at risk for IA and by performing evaluation and comparison studies between FDA-cleared tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests.   Offerors are required to demonstrate relevant experience in establishing and operating a clinical sample repository in accordance with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines, access to human subjects at high risk for developing Invasive Aspergillosis that must include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy and subjects at high risk for IA with potentially interfering medical conditions that must also include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy, personnel with experience in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and collection of samples from human subjects, personnel with experience in Good Laboratory Practices and diagnostic test development, and adequate facilities.  It is expected that these goals be achieved through the establishment and maintenance of a repository of clinical samples from patients at risk for IA and by performing evaluation and comparison studies between FDA-licensed tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests.  Offerors will be evaluated against the adequacy of their training, experience, expertise and availability of the proposed PI, including technical and management skills, knowledge of applicable regulations to manage a GCP and GLP compliant clinical sample repository and ability to direct GLP compliant test studies along with personnel that have appropriate GCP and GLP training.  Offerors should have access to patient populations at risk for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) such that it is highly probable that serial clinical samples will be collected from a minimum of forty-five (45) subjects diagnosed with proven IA and a minimum of forty-five (45) subjects diagnosed with proven IA with potenitially interfering medical conditions during the first three years of the contract.  Offerors will be asked to provide a cost-effective plan for obtaining and storing samples from subjects at risk for developing IA and provide documented evidence of all collaborations/consortiums that will be formed to collect and/or store specimens.  Patient populations must include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy and may also include neutropenic cancer patients, and solid organ transplant recipients.  

Your proposal should address staff expertise in the collection of clinical research samples and medical information in a GCP compliant manner along with an understanding of the OHRP guidelines for the operation of a repository.  It is expected that offerors have experience in the storage, retrieval and distribution of samples and would be expected to provide personnel, facilities (clean rooms, laboratories, storage area, etc.), and equipment (freezers, refrigerators, etc.) available for preparing the samples and the repository, along with a system that will be used to track samples in the repository.  Offerors should have an understanding of Federal, State and international shipping regulations, validation testing for cold chain shipping containers, preparation of SOPs based on the results of validation testing, preparation of all shipping documents, preparation of SOPs for the receipt and proper storage of clinical  samples,  experience in the techniques used in published laboratory tests available to detect Aspergillus fumigatus, including PCR and other technologies that could potentially be used to develop IA diagnostic tests, expertise in performing and interpreting the results from the Bio-Rad PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA test, and access to samples required for replication studies (IA animal model or samples from previous IA clinical studies).  This RFP will be available electronically on/about February 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.    No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a HIGH RESOLUTION-MULTIPLE COLLECTOR-INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM (HR-MC-ICPMS) to be used in the Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

BACKGROUND:
NIST intends to acquire a HR-MC-ICPMS to enable the certification of accurate high precision isotopic Standard Reference Materials (SRMs).  At present, isotopic SRMs are accurately known on an absolute basis to an uncertainty between 0.1 % and 0.03 %, relative.  Recent developments in HR-MC-ICPMS instrumentation have lead to isotope ratio measurements appearing in the scientific literature with uncertainties approaching 10 to 100 ppm, relative.  Such measurements are two orders of magnitude more precise than the standards used to benchmark them.  Applications have also expanded to include medical, environmental as well as forensic studies and have broadened the research field to include isotopic variations in elements that were previously thought to not show any natural fractionation. The HR-MC-ICPMS will form the basis for a renewed focus by NIST on producing SRM materials that will benchmark the advances in this new and exciting sphere of research.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Test Case Generator for Source Code Analyzer

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to award a sole source contract for a Test Case Generator for Source Code Analyzer to KDM Analytics Inc, Wilmington, Delaware under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1). The sole source determination is based on the need that the existing software is proprietary and can only be obtained from KDM.  The objective is to deliver a computer program called test case generator or TCG, to generate reference programs with given variants of weaknesses embedded in code constructs.  The programming language of the references depends on a module.   The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) project needs dozens of reference programs to assess source code analysis tools.  For precise measurement, thousands of reference programs with various combinations of factors and program language traits to validate that assessment, to create the next generation of more accurate and precise assessments, and to research the contribution of such tools to software assurance.  Writing these reference programs by hand would be error prone and take years to complete. A program is needed which takes descriptions of factors and traits in the combinations required, and through sophisticated semantic processing fashions each reference program.  The reference program generator (RPG) must interoperate with the Software Assurance Ecosystem.  In particular, it must use the ISO/IEC 19502 Meta Object Facility and the JSR0040 Java Metadata Interface.  The input language must follow the OMG Knowledge Discovery Meta-model standard specifically, the ISO/IEC 19503 XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) and must use CWE Micro rules.  KDM invented some of the now standard and publicly available techniques and developed specialized Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) micro rules that will be leveraged to automatically generate reference test cases directly from CWE specifications and therefore appears to be uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement.  A firm-fixed-price contract will be awarded for a period of twelve months from date of award.  

Interested parties may identify their interest; however, must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing, no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Cheryl Coxen at cheryl.coxen@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers has a need for a contract for Fabrication and Delivery of floating mooring bitts and anchorages for the river chamber of the future Charleroi Locks located in western Pennsylvania.  A total of fifteen (15) floating mooring bitt s and thirteen (13) anchorages are required; each bitt and anchorage is identical.  Each mooring bitt consists of 3 ft 6 in diameter x 13 ft 8 in long stainless steel pontoon suspended below two line posts. The line post section is approximately 13 ft long .  The line posts consist of and are connected to the pontoon using various sizes of tubular steel shapes.  In addition, there are four sets of rollers on the line post section to permit the mooring bitt to ride up and down the anchorage frame.  The approx imate dimensions of each mooring bitt are 27 ft long x 4 ft 6 in wide x 4 ft 6 ft deep.   Each mooring bitt anchorage is a built up frame consisting of multiple components of steel angle, steel channels, and steel plate. In addition, several areas receive stainless steel cladding.

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Professional Architecture, Engineering and Design Services are required for a firm fixed price contract within the Detroit District mission boundary.    One (1) firm will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competen ce for the required work.   Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety.   The contract awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Detroit District through its preparation of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for t he proposed work.   The contractor selected will need sufficient resources and flexibility to be able to furnish a full range of professional architecture, engineering and design services related to design of approximately 22 miles of interceptor sanitary sewer line, including pump stations and appurtenances.

Its purpose is to allevi ate existing sewer surcharges and provide adequate conveyance consistent with the assumptions for growth in both service areas and customers.    It will initially serve 90 square miles with the ultimate capacity to serve 180 square miles.    Expected servi ces may include, but are not limited to, the following:  architectural design of pump stations and surrounding landscape; technical design of sanitary sewers and pump stations, including hydrologic analyses; preparation of engineering and design report doc uments, construction plans and specifications, and cost estimates.  A firmed fixed price contract will be negotiated and awarded.  The proposed services will be negotiated and obtained through the issuance of a firm fixed price task order.  This announceme nt is open to all businesses regardless of their size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on the part of this work it intends to subcontract.

PROJECT INFORMATION:    The Va Shly ay Akimel Salt River Ecosystem Restoration project located in the Salt River Pima, Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC) adjacent to the City of Mesa in Maricopa County, Arizona, about 18 miles east of downtown Phoenix.  Th e overall project is approximately 14 miles long extending from immediately downstream of the Granite Reef Dam to the Pima Freeway (US 101), and averaged 1,500 feet wide.  Wetland features proposed include cottonwood/willow, open water, wetlands areas and new river bottom.  The project is divided into 3 phases (ph ases I, II and III).  This synopsis covers Phases  I, II and III.  The estimated construction cost for Va Shly ay Akimel is approximately $138,968,000.00. CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Design of Wetlands restoration including aquatic and riparian habitat locating in the arid region.  Wetland features described under project Phase I information below are to be designed under this contract.  Site surveying and mappin g for the project design will be provided. PROJECT WORK AND SERVICES.  The work and services consist of detailed site investigations, planning, engineering studies, preliminary and final design services.  Work and services also comprise the preparation of design documents and other engineering repo rts including Construction Contract Drawings/Plans and Specifications, Design Documentation Reports (DDR), Engineering considerations and instruction to Field personnel (ECIF), and providing support for engineering during construction (EDC).  In addition t o those described above, preparation of the Operation, Maintenance, Repair, Replacement and Rehabilitation Manual (OMRRR) is required for this contract. New Wetland, open water and cottonwood/willow are environmental/wetlands features designed to house and restore native habitat in the arid region including endangered species, vegetation and aquatic plants.   Wetlands features considered for design and con struction also involve reshaping the Salt River riverbed to ensure flow reconnection of the main channel to the old quarry pit, and provide water for the vegetated areas.  This reshaping the Salt Riverbed will form the new river bottom.  The new river bott om shall be planted with vegetation.  The design of the reshaping/grading of the Salt River riverbed is not included in this contract and will be performed by others.  The A-E will be required to incorporate the reshaping/regarding design into final A-E de sign.   Wetland vegetation, primarily cattails, tile, and sedges, require a water table at or near the surface, while open water aquatic plants need a certain depth of water to survive.  Therefore, the surface of all wetland features will be lined to maint ain the necessary surface water and water depth.   To distribute water from the wetland features laterally, a series of drainage ditches/open channels and pipes will be needed to convey water to other areas that require irrigation.  These project features are the project infrastructures called water distribution system.  This is not to be confused with the irrigation system, which requires delivering water (surface water) from the source (irrigation canal) to the newly restored vegetated areas.    Pump stat ions will be needed to deliver water from irrigation channels and groundwater wells to vegetated areas and wetland features.  Pump capacity is estimated to be between 1,500 gallons per minute (gpm) to 5,000 gallon per minute (gpm).     Construction cost estimates must be prepared using the Corps of Engineers M2 (Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System 2nd Generation).  The A-E contractor will be required to acquire the necessary software and training from the vendor(s) to accomplish this task.  Construction drawings/plans shall be prepared using the Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) and delivered in three-dimensional drawings in Bentley Microstation V8 or XM DGN,  and Auto CADD electronic digital format.  The Government will o nly accept the final product without conversion or reformatting.  The firm selected for this contract will be required to submit a quality control plan and to adhere it to during the work and services required under this contract.

<DESC>Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are  solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this  RFI. 4.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will now post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library on 27 April 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC)  2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC  14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, OR
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsmans role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offerors concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner, and he can be reached at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of a Multi-Function Aiming Device.  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is attempting to improve the effectiveness of their soldiers by developing a fully integrated Multi-Function Aiming Device (MFAD) for engaging targets in close quarters combat.  

Combat operations require the soldier to accurately engage enemy personnel targets in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUNT) environments at ranges of 200 meters and closer.  These close quarter battle operations may require the soldier to clear buildings with multiple rooms over extended periods of time.  Reducing the weight of ancillary equipment (e.g. lasers, lights, pistol grips, etc.) and freeing up rail space on the front hand guard of the soldier?s weapon system in order to maintain a stable and solid firing position is critical to mission success.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue and free the weapon system of obstructions in order to accurately engage enemy personnel targets.  The MFAD shall incorporate the following components into a single, integrated system: a day sight, Infrared (IR) laser pointer, IR illuminator, visible laser pointer, and white light flashlight.

This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the MFAD.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 4Q FY07 or 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.    The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 10 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements from approximately 2,300 units to a total production potential of 10,000 units.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Nicole Humphrey, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4379
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to technical questions received. Question # 1: Regarding Item 3:  What efficiency is expected at a useful energy rante of atleast 46 keV? Answer # 1:  EPA would consider 46 keV to be in the "useful energy range" for  this nominal detector size if the aboslute efficiency at 46 keV for a 2" filter paper placed directly on the detector end cap is not less than .015 (1.5%), and .003 (0.3%) for one liter of liquid in a Marinelli beaker. Question # 2: Regarding Item 3:   Would it be possible to obtain manufacturer,  model, and a cross sectional drawing of the existing shield that is in use in order to ensure that the proper cryostat is offered to fit the existing shield? You state that this detector is to be used with an existing dewar, is this correct? Does this mean that the contractor should not supply a  dewar with the new detector? Answer # 2: This detector is a replacement for an aging detector that is beyond economical repair, therefore no dewar is required.  Drawings for the existing shield and dewar are not available.  The cylindrical shield was manufactured by Quantum Technologies and has  inner dimensions of 12" diameter by 16" high, with a swing-open door on top for sample placement.  The base of the shield is supported 29.5" above floor level and is 3.5" thick, which places the bottom of the inner cavity at 33" above floor level.  The bottom opening is 3" in diameter.  The dewar  is 24" high with a 1" thick rubber collar on top, and supported on a shock-absorbing jack stand that is adjustable from 1.5" to 6.5" above floor level.   Question # 3: Regarding Item 5: EPA specifically requests a coaxial detector to be provided for this section. May the contractor propose a  different type detector that will provide a better detector geometry? Is EPA aware that a detector of this size uses a 4 inch diameter end cap? Answer # 3: EPA is aware that a detector crystal of the dimensions specified will requre a large end cap.  EPA included separate statements of intended  use, functional requirements, and specifications believed to be necessary to meet the functional requirements, to encourage proposals for equipment that EPA may not be famialr with through the conducted market research.  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, EPA will consider exceptions  to the specifications if the proposal describes how the equipment will meet the functional requirements.  The specification requirement for ratio of crystal diamter to thichness of 2.25 is believed by EPA to be the minimum necessary, but the relative placement of the contacts and whether the  detector is classified as planar or coaxial are not important.

<DESC>AHRQ-07-10037
Amendment #1
Questions and Answers
1.	Can we get a listing of the group of experts that are currently available to the AHRQ PBRN RC?   Do you encourage the new AHRQ PBRN RC to utilize this current list of experts for the ad hoc consultation and/or technical assistance, or are we expected to create a new list of experts or modify the current one? 
ANSWER: Proposals should include a list of experts (or areas of expertise) specifically available to the offeror for providing consultations and/or technical assistance to PBRNs.

2.	 For Attachment 1, Past Performance Questionnaire, can we change the title from ACTION RFP to the Resource Center RFP?
ANSWER: Yes

3.	 For Attachment 2, Proposal Intent Response Sheet, can you confirm whether the due date is June 8 or June 26? 
ANSWER:  Notices of intent are due June 8. 

4.	 Will the AHRQ provide additional funding to the current Resource Center for a short timeframe (2-6 weeks) to work with the newly funded RC during the transition phase, or should proposals include funding for this activity in Year 1?
ANSWER: Your proposal should not include transition costs for the current Resource Center. 

5.	Please confirm that the $350k ceiling on the award includes indirect costs, e.g. for an institution with a 54% indirect rate, about $225k/year in directs is maximum award. 
ANSWER:    $350,000 is the Government?s estimate of the cost of performing the SOW, inclusive of all overheads and indirects, and it just an estimate.  Your proposal should be based on your cost of performing the statement of work and the proposal should contain the rationale and justification for those costs.

6.	Will David Lanier be the project officer and person with whom the contractor will work on a day to day basis?  If not, who will be? 
ANSWER:.  Dr. Lanier will serve as Project Officer for this contract.  

7.	What can you say about the degree of flexibility to direct the resource center?s efforts to PBRN needs more pressing/ promising than those listed as tasks? 
ANSWER:   The contractor will be expected to complete fully and on time all tasks described in the RFP.  Should AHRQ identify additional tasks within the overall scope of work of this contract that the Resource Center can reasonably accomplish before the contract expires, it has the option of assigning these new tasks through a contract modification.  AHRQ?s ability to modify a contract is contingent, however,  upon the availability of funds.

8.	Has there been any consideration of partnering this initiative with another agency/funding source?   If so, what mechanism exists to implement such a strategy? 
ANSWER:   While private/non-Federal organizations with interests similar to those of the Federal government are welcome to contribute to awards made under a Federal contract, the contract itself is solicited, negotiated and managed solely by the Federal government.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ON SCREENING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. Pursuant to Section 44920 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Public Law 107-71 (November 19, 2001), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) established the Screening Partnership Program (SPP) in which an airport may apply to have the screening of passengers and baggage at the airport carried out by screening personnel of a qualified private company (also referred to as the Opt-Out program) under a contract entered into with TSA. 

The TSA is seeking industry participation in the development of the acquisition strategy for the procurement of services for passenger and baggage screening workforce management for disparate locations within a given state or regional area (e.g. a group of states). Specifically, TSA is currently considering the state of Montana for a single contract for multiple airports in order for all airports involved to receive passenger and baggage screening services under the Screening Partnership Program.  Some of the airports involved may currently have screening services provided by TSA, and some may not.  This RFI serves as a means of gaining ideas relevant to the development of an effective acquisition approach to procure passenger and baggage screening services operated in multiple locations under a single contract vehicle. 

This requirement will include Human Resources functions, such as the recruitment, assessment, and the training of screeners. TSA seeks to implement a procurement process that (a) follows ATSA; (b) encourages innovation and cost savings while ensuring security; (c) provides flexibility to meet changing security needs; (d) streamlines the issuance of contracts; and (e) encourages competition. 

The estimated period of performance will be a base period plus four one-year options. This RFI serves as a means of gaining ideas relevant to the following: (1) Acquisition Strategy, (2) Contract Structure, (3) Contract Type, and (4) Performance Standards/Metrics (to be used as cost and performance incentives); (5) Identification of cost drivers; (6) Control Issues; (7) Suggested methods to ensure TSA oversight; (8) Proposal Evaluation Criteria; (9) Information contractors feel they would need in the Request for Proposal (RFP) to make an informed proposal; (10) Identification of possible opportunities for small business participation; and (11) Ideas on how to best achieve the objectives listed above.
  
Industry input shall not include proprietary information, nor shall the comments deviate from any of the requirements for the program, Section 44920 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) (P.L. 107-71). This announcement is for a submission of a WHITE-PAPER, it is NOT a request for proposals, nor is it a request for capability statements. TSA is not accepting unsolicited proposals. The Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted. The results of this RFI will be used in the development of: a formal solicitation which is contemplated for release in the latter part of 2007 or early 2008. The resulting formal criteria for the solicitation will be announced at the Federal Business Opportunities website. All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than June 21, 2007 to the following email address: OPT-OUT@tsa.dhs.gov.  Early responses are encouraged.  All submissions are restricted to no more than ten (10) pages in length. Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of these services. TSA thanks all respondents for their comments and input.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement for written information only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) and Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC) are considering potential contract awards for unique line items of materiel.  The primary goal is to quickly procure and deliver items funded by a FY07 cost of war supplemental appropriation. The materiel to be procured is from the Tables of Allowances (TOAs) managed by the Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC) in direct support of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Naval Beach Group (NBG), Special Warfare (SPECWAR) and other Navy expeditionary units ashore. Items to be procured will be predominantly (but may not be limited to):  individual infantry equipment; individual protective equipment; construction and mechanical tools (kits); miscellaneous construction, office and maintenance supplies/consumables; expeditionary (field) medical and dental equipment/supplies; photographic equipment and ancillary support equipment; (tactical) computer equipment and shipping/storage cases; communications equipment; medical supplies and equipment; dental supplies and equipment and tent camp facilities.

NAVFAC and NFELC currently procure these items through a variety of methods, but due to the volume of requirements and the limited amount of time to execute awards prior to the end of the fiscal year, NAVFAC and FISC are seeking sources interested in aggregating significant portions of the identified groups of materiel and delivering those items under two or more separate contracts.

<SUBJECT>45--Space Heater Convective 120,000 BTU (SHC 120K) Market Survey
<SOLNBR>SHC120K-2007
<RESPDATE>071807
<ARCHDATE>09162007
<CONTACT>Richard Guiliano, 508-233-4697
<DESC>Manufacturers of heaters in the 120,000 BTU/hr range are sought.  The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM  FSS), Natick, MA is conducting a market survey to locate potential manufacturers of  Space Heater Convective 120,000 BTU (SHC 120K).  The SHC 120K requirement is for  a self-powered, thermoelectric heater that will provide soldiers operating in basic, cold and extreme cold environments with a safe, portable, lightweight, multi-fueled, forced-air heater in the 120,000 BTU/hr range.  The SHC 120K must be able to operate o utside the tent without the need for an external power supply (i.e., field generator).  The SHC 120K generates its own electrical power through the use of thermoelectric modules located inside the combustion chamber that convert waste heat into electricity .  The internal generation of electrical power gives the SHC 120K the added capabilities of single switch operation, forced hot air circulation, outside the tent operation, completely automatic safety and temperature controls, built-in troubleshooting diag nostics, operation without the need for a fire guard, and significantly higher combustion efficiencies, all without the need for external generator.  The heater must burn multiple diesel fuels and operate in extreme cold temperatures down to -60oF.  The SH C 120K will be equipped with a remote intelligent control box that informs the heaters operator of a problem and how to easily resolve the problem.  The SHC 120Ks unique, self-powering capability enables the heating system to be smaller (less than 29 cub ic feet), lighter (less than 400 lbs), more mobile, versatile, reliable, efficient, and is an ideal match for meeting the future battle field requirements to reduce the logistic burden of supplying fuel and power to the field.  The SHC 120K is intended to replace  existing Army heaters in the 120,000 BTU/hr range with a self-powering heating  capability to support applications for heating Modular General Purpose Tent System  (MGPTS) and Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) complexes, maintenance  tents, critical operation centers, Force Provider billeting tents, Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS), Laundry Advanced System (LADS), Containerized Batch Laundry (CBL), etc.  Compared to the current military heaters, the SHC 120K will provide an improved  heating capability that is lighter weight, more mobile, reliable, efficient, maintainable, and reduces the logistics footprint and burden for meeting battle field requirements.  All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to  respond to this request for information.  Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, and relevant company background/experience.  Information submissions must be received NLT 18 July 2007.  Responses  to this notice should be directed to:  U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems, Shelter Systems Team, ATTN: SFAE-CSS-FP-F (Joseph MacKoul), Natick MA  01760-5057, facsimile to 508-233-5533, or email to Joseph.MacKoul@us .army.mil.  All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction. This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only. This is not an Invitation fo r Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a commitment by U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center.

<DESC>The Office of the Product Manager- Medium Cannon Caliber Ammunition and the U.S. Army Joint Munitions & Lethality, LCMC, Acquisition Center is conducting  a market survey to identify potential sources for the procurement of a  replacement round for the 20mm PGU-28/B round. Current 20mm combat rounds limit mission effectiveness.  These rounds are used  on aircraft that utilize the M61 Cannon.  To meet current mission requirements  it is necessary to procure a non-fuzed, non explosive round with PGU-28/B  performance.  The Government has no Research, Development, Test and  Engineering (RDT&E) dollars and therefore is seeking a non developmental item. The replacement round will be a form-fit-function replacement.  The  replacement round must have the same ballistic performance and physical  dimensions as the PGU-28/B to prevent the need for software or equipment  modification.  Additionally, the replacement round must meet or exceed the  safety requirements outlined in MIL-STD-1316, be a non-fuzed,non-explosive  combat round with performance similar to the PGU-28/B, be cost effective and  easily scaleable to mass production.  If procured, the replacement round will  utilize the same logistics support as the current 20 mm round.  Based on the  cost and design of this replacement round, the Air Force may transition to a  single round for both combat and training with associated benefits in user  proficiency and regularly rotated stock.  The Government is interested in  procuring a producible Technical Data Package, and may compete future buys.   The Government does not intend to pay for any information.  All responses are  requested no later than 22 June 2007. Contact: Jim Terhune, OPM-MAS, (973) 724-2839 Jim Terhune, jterhune@pica.army.mil SFAE-AMO-MAS-SMC,Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000

<SUBJECT>Z--Privatization of Army Family Housing at Small Installations (Remaining Non-Privatized) located throughout the United States
<SOLNBR>W912DR-07-S-0015
<RESPDATE>071607
<ARCHDATE>09142007
<CONTACT>Nichol Fitzpatrick, 301-677-3007
<DESC>Request for Information: The Army is looking for ways to improve and sustain Army (Family and single Soldier) housing at 21 installations at various locations in the U.S. and seeks to determine private sector interest in working with the Army to find  traditional or non-traditional strategies.  Each installation may contain from one home to 333 homes.   These are locations where Army partnerships with private sector developers/property managers (Residential Communities Initiative--RCI) have not yet occ urred.  The Army is permitted to combine as few or as many installations as needed into any project and seeks private sector advice in crafting solutions.  The Army believes that solutions include, but are not limited to, a more traditional approach (desig n, build and manage housing on government land) or other non-standard strategies including privatization (10 USC 2871) enhanced use leasing (10 USC 2667), real property exchange, GSA relocation, new off-post government leases, tying an Army housing proje ct with other existing or planned DoD or commercial housing projects.   The Army encourages smaller, locally-based developers, property managers and investors to help find solutions.  Larger firms and current RCI Partners are also encouraged to respond.  Respondents may express interest or offer potential approaches for one, s everal, or all locations.  The Army is furnishing detailed information about the specific properties in Attachment 1, as well as summary information about the housing communities at each of the installations.  Information is also provided about the need to  house single Soldiers where a requirement exists at that installation.  Responses to the RFI may also consider single Soldiers' needs and non-key and essential civilians as an additional source of commercial interest. The office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations & Environment) is issuing this Request for Information to determine the type and depth of industry interest in working with the Army to achieve a solution.  Respondents to this announcement a re requested to identify their interest in these projects and to provide a brief opinion on the viability of privatizing housing all or a portion of these locations via traditional or non-traditional development strategies.  The Army seeks the opinion of R espondents in order to gauge the potential to successfully improve and sustain housing at these small installations. The Army would be interested to know if industry would consider these to be individual projects or if they should be grouped for geographic al locations and/or financial efficiencies.  In preparing responses, interested parties will be asked to consider the 'community amenities' and 'neighborhood character' surrounding the family housing area -- and that may well include playgrounds and other quality of life considerations.  Attachment 2 contains information on the Army Material Command Installations. Similar information for the other installations listed in Attachment 1 can be found on their respective installation websites.  Interested partie s are invited to provide their written opinion of the options to privatize Army family housing at these smaller installations while remaining within the allowed authorities. Firms with experience in historic preservation, historic tax credits, residential construction, operation, and management are encouraged to recommend means by which privatization could be accomplished.   The Army seeks firms whose innovative approach to financing and organizational structure will minimize or eliminate the requirement fo r Army financial contributions, and may include proposed exchange of real property, leasing, (enhanced use and traditional off-post individual leases).  Interested concerns are invited to provide their written opinion of the feasibility of satisfying the A rmy housing needs at these installations.  Responses (ten pages or less) should also include the company name, a brief statement of relevant corporate background (statement of capabilities) as it relates to low-rise (3 story or less) housing development/construction, property management and project financing, point of contact, telephone number and email address, as well as  address the following types of information: -	Which installation(s) will be nominated/selected? -	Amount and type of housing that is anticipated at each installation nominated/selected? -	Type/nature of proposed business structure (including the legislative authority that authorizes this structure(s))? -	Estimated timeline(s) associated with implementation? -	Level of Army financial or managerial participation? -	Any concerns/challenges that will/may impact the privatization at the nominated/selected installation(s)? Attachments 1 & 2 may be viewed at the Baltimore District's public website, under CURRENT ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES at http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/ebs.htm. Please supply your response via overnight delivery to the Contract Specialist, Nichol Fitzpatrick, at the following address: HQ USACE RCI PDT, 4471 Redwood Road, Fort Meade, MD 20755.  Please send a minimum of one hard copy and one electronic copy of your response no later than 16 July 2007.   This announcement constitutes a sources sought / market research synopsis and will close 16 July 2007.  Information obtained as a result of this announcement is for planning purposes only and may or may not be used for a subsequent solicitation.  It does n ot constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal and should not be construed as a commitment by the Army.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Street Broom to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of Street Broom to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of a street broom by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Street Broom 
7920-00-NIB-0461

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 7, Ft. Worth, TX.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Street Brooms to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

Weiler 42033 ? 16? Street Broom with brown synthetic fill
ProEnd 01252584 ? 16? Street Broom, brown poly

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing street brooms to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 29, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Global Positioning System (GPS) Block III RFP Release
<DESC>This is a modification to the Synopsis originally posted on 05 April 2007.

The Global Positioning System Wing will post a final request for proposal FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library on or before 08 June 2007. The Navstar GPS is a satellite based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, and will introduce a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-Code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitate international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted websites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a user name and password, before granting access.

In order to access the Bidders Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:
a. A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificated, along with a CAC reader and software, or
b. A DoD-approved External Certificate Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html) This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.

OMBUDSMAN:
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communication his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsman?s role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer, but to advocate the offerors concerns on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. Lindsey Arison who can be reached at (310) 653-1780 or lindsey.arison@losangeles.af.mil

<SUBJECT>15 -- QF-16 Industry Day I Annoucement
<DESC>This notification replaces the Special Notice posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) on 21 March announcing the QF-16 Industry Days for 1-3 May 2007 in its entirety. 

The 728th Armament Systems Group, 328th Armament Systems Wing (AFMC), announces the first of a series of Industry Days for the future acquisition of the QF-16 Air Superiority Target (AST) to be held 16-19 July 2007 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.  The purpose of this event is to provide available program information pertaining to the QF-16 Full Scale Target Drone and will include a QF-16 program overview and draft QF-16 requirements.  Additional briefings will include the technical requirements relevant to Logistics, Engineering, Drone Operations, and Testing.  

The QF-16 requirement contains classified elements that will not be discussed at this Industry Day event.  However, we anticipate this information will be presented at a future event(s) and will require responding firms to have a secret level security clearance.  We anticipate this procurement will be limited to U.S. owned firms only.  Prime contractors would then be allowed to request export license for participation of foreign companies as subcontractors.

An opportunity for Contractors to tour the Drone Operations at Tyndall Air Force Base, Panama City, Florida is tentatively scheduled for 16 July 2007.  The Industry Day Presentations will be conducted from 0800 - 1500hrs CST at the Bob Hope Village, Shalimar, Florida.  Directions to the Bob Hope Village and a specific agenda will be posted separately on the FedBizOpps website.  The Government would like to have structured discussions about the QF-16 requirements and future solicitations.  Please review the information located on the FedBizOpps website prior to the meeting and keep in mind that this information will be updated periodically.  The Government may be better able to answer questions of interested parties during Industry Days if they are submitted prior to the forum.  Submit any questions known in advance by using the QF-16 Industry Days Question Request Form located on the FedBizOpps website and follow the instructions for submission located on the form.  General questions will be posted on FedBizOpps for Industry comments leading up to the event.  Index cards will also be provided during Industy Days for submission of additional questions. 

One-on-one discussions for prime contractors, in a proprietary only forum, with Government personnel will be scheduled 18-19 July 2007.  The length of time allotted for each potential offeror will be determined based upon the number of respondents requesting a one-on-one session.  Each contractor will receive an equal allotment of time.  Your desire to have such discussions must be submitted by 10 July 2007 using a separate QF-16 Industry Days Question Request Form located on the FedBizOpps website.  Discussions will be scheduled in the order received and you will receive an e-mail notification of the time and location for discussions.  It is the responsibility of Industry to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any follow-on information. The Government is interested in Industry ideas concerning vector scoring including accuracy, reliability, encryption, spectrum issues, and validation; system airborne software development independent of aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level for prime and subcontractors; potential incorporation of onboard flight recorded data; airworthiness certification; risk management processes; requirements traceability; systems engineering plans; target control system integration; and potential for an auto landing system. 

Contractors can also access information pertaining to the QF-16 Program via ATIMS.  ATIMS is a centralized web-based Information Management System providing on-line encrypted internet access. ATIMS access is recommended prior to Industry Days to share/view information related to the QF-16 Program. This restricted website allows data exchanges without distribution to the general public. Instructions on how to secure an ATIMS account are located on the FedBizOpps website. 

This Industry Day event is open to all interested parties.  Attendance at the scheduled Industry Day and any discussions/release of information is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information or costs associated with travel.  As access will be required during the solicitation process, responding firms must have a secret level security clearance and export control certification in accordance with DoD 5230.25 in place early enough to access the solicitation package and prepare a responsive proposal.  A certification is required by U.S. contractors that wish to obtain access to unclassified technical data disclosing militarily critical technology with military or space application that is under the control of, or in the possession of the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD).  Export control certification may be obtained through the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI, 49017-3084, telephone 1-877-352-2255, website: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp.  For submission of visit requests and clearances see instructions below.

<SUBJECT>25 -- Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV)  Industry Day
<DESC>ATTENTION:  Important Notice for Small Businesses Doing Business with the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC).  The Defense Logistics Agency will host an Industry Day on June 28, 2007, at the Defense Supply Center Columbus http://www.dscc.dla.mil, Columbus, Ohio for the Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) Program.  This concept aims to capitalize on the strengths of the Supply Chain Integrator and the Government to improve the supply chain process while increasing both supply availability and parts reliability.

This initiative will require vendors to provide items classified as "bench stock" hardware for a given military depot or maintenance facility.  Although the Army is the primary customer, other DoD activities may be included in the scope of this effort.

1. BACKGROUND - The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  S&T performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, and universities.  With terrorist events such as the Madrid rail bombing, the London Underground attack, and the recent exposure of possible attacks on U.S. bound flights from the United Kingdom, there is an urgent operational need for a unified approach to the detection of liquid explosives in the civil aviation industry as well as other mass transit modes of transportation.  This project is in support of the ongoing effort by S&T to counter the recent increase from liquid explosives threat.  S&T's goal is to investigate any and all potential detection technologies capable of detecting and distinguishing explosives and flammable liquids from benign liquids (drinks, lotions, hygiene products, contact lens solutions, etc.).  Homemade Explosives (HME) such as black powder, triacetonetriperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene-triperoxidediamine (HMTD), chlorates, and perchlorates mixed with sugar or other fuels have come to be used instead of commercial explosives.  In support of this critical focus area, S&T is initiating the Home Made Explosives (HME) Detection System Development Program. Its goals are: To immediately evaluate Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME); To develop, rapidly prototype, and improve products and systems capable of detecting HMEs; To support the research and development of next generation, novel technologies, algorithms or prototypes for the detection of HMEs; To address potential operational venues, including airport and mass transit checkpoints for passengers and carryon baggage (not cargo or checked baggage).  This BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) with multi-phased program approaches described in Section 2.4.  The BAA is structured to solicit Proposals for the immediate evaluation of projects (TTA-1) where COTS are to be evaluated within 3 to 6 months after award.  Proposals are also to be solicited to develop and improve products in the Prototype or Breadboard stage (TTA-2).  It is anticipated that prototypes will be ready for developmental testing under TTA-2 no later than 30 months after award.  In addition, proposals will be solicited to support the research and development of the next generation or novel technologies in an immature stage of development (TTA-3).  It is anticipated that these technologies will be ready for prototype developmental testing no later than 48 months after award.  The final Proposal solicitation will be for innovative algorithms and data analysis tools to support current COTS and prototypes under development (TTA-4).  It is anticipated that algorithms and data analysis tools will be ready for hosting and testing on selected HME platforms within 24 months after award.
1.1  Program Description - The Home Made Explosives Detection Program will require current technology, and/or innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including material science, computer science, chemistry, physics, electrical, mechanical and systems engineering.  In order to best accomplish these goals, S&T anticipates receiving proposals with innovative teaming that may include private sector organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and academic institutions.  DOE National Laboratories are precluded from participating in this BAA and any potential R&D efforts by the National labs will be funded separately by S&T.  TTA-4 is intended to encourage small companies and academic institutions with innovative ideas for advanced algorithms and data analysis tools that could be hosted on COTS or near COTS systems.  Coordination and potential teaming is encouraged between algorithm developers and hardware or system developers in Phase II of the TTA-4 projects to demonstrate the proposed capability.
2. PROGRAM APPROACH AND SCHEDULE - The approach and schedule ensures that HME detection technologies will be in place in a timely manner to be effective against indiscriminate threats and new innovative technologies will be researched to further the Nation?s safety.  S&T anticipates making multiple awards under this solicitation.  Small companies and academic institutions with innovative detection technologies or advanced analysis algorithms are encouraged to propose efforts under the most appropriate TTA.  Coordination and potential teaming between hardware or system developers and algorithm developers is encouraged in the Phase II efforts.  2.1 Government Furnished Equipment and Resources - In support of the TTAs, the Government will consider requests for Government furnished resources and technologies.  As part of this solicitation S&T will not publish a list of potentially applicable technologies for accelerated schedule Proposals.  2.2 Review Panel - A review panel drawn from Government and non-Government experts who have signed appropriate non-disclosure agreements will perform technical evaluations or assessments of the proposed efforts.  2.3 Test and Evaluation Facilities - Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate will make available appropriate test and evaluation facilities to support this program.  Bidders must note any specific requirements required for test and evaluation (T&E) of proposed concepts in their proposal.  Due to the nature of the material being tested and safety concerns, T&E activities will be conducted by trained personnel per S&T' direction.  It will be the responsibility of the selected performers to setup, maintain, and train S&T directed test personnel on the selected systems.  2.4 Program Structure and Program Schedule - The BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs), described below. Responses to TTA-1 should propose immediate (3-6 month) solutions, TTA-2 should provide near term (6-30 month) solutions, TTA-3 should provide long term (30-48 month) developmental solutions, whereas those to TTA-4 should describe algorithm and data analysis technology for the immediate and near term solutions for testing within 24 months.  All responses to TTA-2, TTA-3, and TTA-4 should describe multi-phased efforts, offering clear points for decisions about whether proceeding to the next phase is technically justified.  Performance enhancements that should be strongly considered include increased probability of detection, reduced false alarm rate or automated determinations to aid screener decision making.  Continuation of work past Phase I will also be based upon the availability of funds, potential teaming arrangements and other programmatic considerations as determined by S&T.  
TTA-1: Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  
TTA-2: Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS) coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables:  Successful Critical Design Review (CDR) and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 6-30 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-3: Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype, system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Successful CDR and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system. Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 30-48 months after award of Phase I, test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-4: Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Feasibility analysis, performance predictions with supporting data for the modified systems.  Completed teaming arrangements with hardware or system developers.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Software package ready for T&E in 24 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  Figure 1. A notional schedule of the program execution timeline.  Offerors are encouraged to propose their own schedule based upon their detailed understanding of the technical challenges and their realistic estimate of the technical effort required to solve the problem they propose.  Projects addressing each of the TTAs must include: contractor performed lab tests, developmental test and evaluation tasks, and, where appropriate, operational user-oriented field tests.  3. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, 3.1 Preliminary Requirements - There are a number of operational requirements that need to be addressed when evaluating technologies for potential deployment. Below is a list of preliminary requirements that will be refined or clarified by TSA with respect to their future operations.  It is assumed that unopened containers for primary screening will be the standard, and that opening containers may be a potential approach for secondary screening to clear alarms from primary screening.  A threat/no threat response will be satisfactory for primary screening (no threat meaning that this item contains a substance that is recognized to be a typical stream of commerce substance, and a threat designation represents something outside that definition).  It is recognized that some techniques provide higher quality chemical identification than others (with concurrent disadvantages in other areas).  A probability of detection (Pd) objective will be >0.90 and a false alarm rate (FAR) <0.05.  However, much higher Pds and much lower FARs are desired and preference will be given to proposals that realistically project these improved rates.  The throughput objective is no fewer than five people per minute or 10 packages/items per minute.  Total time includes entry and exit of portal or checkpoint, analysis, and results.  Consumables (e.g., filters, reactive agents, batteries) required for operation and routine maintenance of the production system (if any) should be minimal, and should not exceed 5% of the unit cost per year of routine operations.  The production system should not require extensive factory level maintenance.  If factory level maintenance is required, it must not normally be required at a greater frequency than one time every three years, and should not cost over 10% of the total unit cost.  The system must be designed so it is sufficiently easy to operate such that security personnel following initial training (not to exceed 12 hours) can safely and effectively operate the system.  Safety standards:  Must meet appropriate safety standards for safe operation, Must meet Hazards and Electronic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) safety standards, Must be intrinsically safe per Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 913, Any field calibration, if required, must be accomplished within the setup time (or separately during routine maintenance) without any specialized instrumentation, Powered using standard U.S. power requirements (Selectable 115 VAC 60 Hz or 220 VAC 60 Hz), or where appropriate, batteries (e.g., off the shelf 9V, C, or AA and/or rechargeable versions), All proposed concepts and designs must be appropriate for indoor and/or outdoor applications, must be benign to humans and property in the interrogated area, and eventually must be cost-effective to procure and maintain.  Depending on the concept design and application, the devices should have the potential to be portable, transportable, or moveable between inspection sites.  Deliverables, depending on the TTA level shall include a COTS or prototype device and an operator?s manual, suitable for dissemination to law enforcement or security professionals, which includes maintenance procedures and a recommended operational employment protocol.
3.2 Technical Topic Areas - The objectives and goals of each TTA emphasize specific phases of readiness of technologies, systems and algorithms in the detection of HMEs.  The TTA topics are detailed below:  TTA-1: Immediate Need - Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  TTA-2: Near Term Need - Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and CONOPS coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.
TTA-3: Long Term Need - Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.  TTA-4: Algorithm Need - Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems (including currently deployed systems) for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) options; 

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 

(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision) 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011


See Numbered Note 1.

 The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The Unites States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement.  Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. 

The closing date for receipt of offers is 19 June, 2007, 3:00pm EST. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-335-6962, email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil  The evaluation factor for award of this requirement will be based on lowest price obtained from a responsible offeror. FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Jun 2006) Offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their offer or complete only paragraph (j) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov <http://orca.bpn.gov/> .

<DESC>Express Delivery Services

I.  BACKGROUND

CDC?s use of Express Delivery Services has grown substantially over the years.  CDC shipments have increased as have the dollars spent on such services.  The receipt and payment of Express Delivery Service Invoices was initially done in house when the volume of CDC shipments was much more manageable.  In 1993, the Financial Management Office sought a vendor who would support an increasing need to properly manage all of CDC?s Express Delivery Service Needs.  This vendor was required to receive all of CDC?s express delivery service invoices thru EDI, properly code the invoices and related shipments for proper payment and accounting, and also audit the rates charged by the service provider to see that CDC is not being overcharged.  The vendor would also seek credits on CDC?s behalf for shipments that were not made in a timely manner.  The vendor would have to perform these functions timely to ensure that invoice payments were not delayed which could result in interest penalty payments being made.

II.  PURPOSE

The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of a vendor who can process all express delivery service payments for CDC?s Financial Management Office.  The vendor would need to effectively and accurately receive and transmit billing information, identify account numbers that would match up with common accounting numbers (CAN), generate reports, assemble all data and submit an electronic payment file that can be easily uploaded into our Payables module of CDC?s Oracle based Financial System called UFMS.  
    
III.  SCOPE OF WORK:

The vendor shall provide all the labor and material necessary to accomplish the tasks for the express delivery services for the Financial Management Office (FMO) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

4.	Enter the manual, automated and unidentified shipments.

5.	Provide detailed reports showing shipment details.

6.	Adjust data when and where applicable for over shipments, unacceptable shipments, and errors.

7.	Merge data from the EDI and manual invoices to prepare for payment.

8.	Transmit files to CDC for upload into CDC?s accounting system, namely UFMS no later than 21 days after receipt of invoice from the shipping company. 

9.	Prepare and transmit remittance files, non-pay files and any other files required by the shipping company.

VI.	PROJECT OFFICER

Curtis Meusel will be the Project Officer.  Upon award, all questions regarding the technical aspects of this order shall be referred to the Project Officer.  

VII.  MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF VENDOR OR VENDOR REPRESENTATIVE

CDC will need to receive a flat file from the vendor.  CDC will provide the flat file format.  The vendor will need to provide all of the accounting information shown in the format including fiscal year (FY) and common accounting numbers.

Vendor needs to check express delivery service invoices for pricing discrepancies.  A one hundred percent audit is required of all shipping charges to ensure that CDC was billed fairly and billed at the government rate. 

CDC wants access to the data.  CDC also needs to have the capability of reviewing and querying reports on line and creating adhoc reports.  

Allow CDC CIO?s to access the data via Internet. 

Generate and send email messages to cost centers for reconciliation.  Information should provide all relevant shipping information such as account numbers, shipping numbers, complete shipping information for the sender and receiver including name and address and proof of delivery.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to notify vendors that the Fedbid.com quote deadline has been extended to Wednesday, May 23, 2007 at 12:00 PM (noon) EST.

Additionally, the part list as posted to Fedbid.com on May 15 is still accurate and has not changed. Because this final part list is slightly different from the original announcement posted at Fedbizopps on April 20, 2007, it is listed herein for reference purposes:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted from a potential offeror. Referenced drawings and pictures can be found at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfp/07tb05.htm 

Q-1.  How close to the sidewalls, floor, and ceiling the source antenna is when it is at its maximum travel? 

A-1.  The source antenna can be moved in a square area of 18 inches wide x 12 inches high located on the center line of the back wall of the chamber.  See the Chamber Drawing for dimensions. The source antennas are shown in the Source Antenna picture. 

Q-2.  How close to the transmit wall is the moving horn assembly?  

A-2.   Approximately 14 inches

Q-3.  Where are the doors located in the facility?  

A-3.  See the chamber drawing for door dimensions and location. Picture of door is shown in the Chamber Door picture.

Q-4. Is there an existing drawing or sketch of the facility? 

A-4. See the Chamber Drawing. 

Q-5. Where is the chamber located? First floor?  

A-5.  The chamber is located on the first floor of Building 210 at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC.  The diagram of Bldg 210 shows where the chamber is located.

Q-6.   I think the "2" is a "-" which puts the chamber performance at - 40 dB @ 4-6- Ghz, -45 dB @ 6- 18 Ghz, and -50 dB @ 18 - 35 Ghz. Is this correct?  

A-6.  We cannot see the typo that you are referring to; however, the information is restated as follows: The quiet zone reflectivity is:
                                                            4-6 GHz  greater than or equal to 40 db
                                                            6-18 GHz  greater than or equal to 45 db
                                                            18-36 GHz  greater than or equal to 50 db

Q-7.  The chamber is too small to allow for a 6ft diameter QZ.  The chamber would have to be 18ft x 18ft in cross section to allow a 6ft diameter QZ. The 12ft x 12ft dimension will allow a 4ft diameter QZ maximum. Would a smaller quiet zone be acceptable?  

A-7. Offerors should propose based on the best capability that can be done with the information provided in the solicitation.

Q-8. What type of RF shielded Enclosure is currently being utilized for the chamber? Who manufactured it? 

A-8. Our best information indicates it is a Boeing chamber.  However this cannot be verified.  It was built about 27 years ago.

Q-9. Will any RF attenuation testing and verification be needed for the project?  

A-9. The specification states: Testing of the quiet zone should be included in the chamber refurbishment.  

All other terms and conditions of the original combined synopsis/solicitation remain unchanged.

The Contractor shall supply the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios to the following locations (quantities in brackets):

?USCG Communication Station Kodiak AK ? Ten (10) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station New Orleans LA - Eight (8) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station Honolulu HI - Six (6) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station Boston, MA ? Ten (10) URG-III HF Radio Systems

?USCG Communication Station Miami, FL ? Five (5) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG CAMSPAC ? Seven (7) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG CAMSLANT ? Twelve (12) URG-III HF Radio systems

?10 Fleet Spares

Installing URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios allows the USCG to be interoperable with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN) system. This interoperability allows the USCG to reduce our current stand-alone HF system from 123 HF High Power Transmitters to 79, saving approximately $9M.  Supply systems and support structures are already in place for the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios within the Department of Homeland Security. Converting or updating this system would require several million dollars and will add additional delays. In addition, updating the existing USCG Radio Remote Access Control Software (RADRACS) software for a different radio would cost approximately $1M. Combining the COTHEN/USCG HF systems supports the Department of Homeland Security Strategic Goal/Policy to make the various operating agencies within the Department interoperable. A common system for the Department of Homeland Security improves the security posture of the nation, increases mission effectiveness and better serves the taxpayers. This URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios interfaces with the HF cellular Automatic Link Establishment network which is controlled by the Rockwell Collins remote control console used by CBP and USCG forces. The USCG developed RADRACS, which currently controls the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios and would have to be modified to control a different radio with no guarantee of interoperability within the CBP and USCG networks as well as increasing costs and delays.
