<DESC>Agricultural Exports and Rural Incomes (AERI) RFP Pre-Solicitation Notice

Description:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the program described below.   

The new, five-year Agricultural Exports and Rural Incomes (AERI) project is designed to address three key socio-economic problems in Egypt:  high unemployment, low rural income and underdeveloped agricultural export potential.   The goal of AERI is to increase rural incomes and on-farm and agro-business jobs.   Its purpose is to strengthen the competitiveness of Egypt?s agriculture in a global economy by expanding access of Egypt?s farmers and agribusiness firms to the knowledge, technology, markets and institutions that are key elements for success.   Interventions under AERI will emphasize:
1.  Increasing agricultural incomes to stimulate increased rural non-farm employment, especially in Upper Egypt;
2.  Improving the productivity and competitiveness of smallholders to achieve increased incomes;
3.  Broadening horticultural development efforts to diversify crops and markets, enhance the role of small growers as suppliers to exporters, integrate the fresh and processes segments of the industry, and expand the use of good agricultural practices in domestic horticulture;
4.  Improving the smallholder livestock sector as a means to increase agricultural incomes, especially for women who dominate this sector;
5.  Bringing about world-class research and training that is more responsive to private sector needs; and 
6.  Targeting policy reform and implementation linked to the achievements of points 1-5 

AERI?s goal and purpose will be achieved through five activities.   Activities three and four will be implemented through grants.  The corresponding Request for Applications is posted in a separate notice.

This RFP pertains specifically to three out of AERI?s five activities as follows:  Activity One:  Policy; Activity Two:  Technical Support to Agriculture-based Trade Associations; Activity Five:  Legacy Program Design.  One direct contract will be awarded for implementation of these three activities.  Implementation will occur over a five year period.  

Activities One and Five:  The objectives of Activities one and five are to consolidate and build on gains made in Egypt?s agricultural competitiveness through past USAID programs, with support to Government of Egypt (GOE) agricultural policy reforms, coordination of all AERI project activities, and assurance of long-term sustainability for certain project elements.


Activity Two:  The objectives of Activity two are to consolidate and build on gains made in Egypt?s agricultural competitiveness through past USAID programs, with support to key technological elements of the marketing chain for strategically selected agricultural commodities promoted by trade associations.

The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under AERI.

USAID encourages qualified bidders to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of project objectives.   Bidders must propose an approach that carries out the project objectives and seeks to institutionalize the thrust of the objectives.

We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a November 03, 2002.

Please correct Fax number for Nihal Montasser to read: 011-202-5164739.

<DESC>NA The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has a requirement for treaty escort and  transportation services and housing support for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) international inspectors and their U.S. Government escorts during their extended stays  for treaty inspections at eight chemical agent disposal facility (CDF) locations within the continental U.S. The treaty escort/ transportation services primarily include the furnishing of full-time qualified arms control treaty escorts, drivers and vehicl e(s). To be qualified escorts and drivers, contractor personnel must possess a SECRET security clearance, pass an occupational health exam, submit to blood and urine tests, and complete US Government chemical weapons demilitarization, treaty orientation an d safety courses, in addition to possessing valid state licenses. Vehicles consist of a van and possibly up to 5 additional vehicles at each of the eight CDF locations. The housing support primarily includes providing approximately 8 to 19 hotel-like lodgi ng rooms in a low crime area that is within commuting distance of each of the eight CDF locations and near appropriate amenities and conveniences (restaurants, laundry & dry cleaning services, etc.). It also includes office space near the rooms for the lod ging driver. The rooms are for lodging a continual succession of treaty inspectors and escorts, each staying approximately 3-6 weeks. Inherent in performing these services, the contractor would conduct program management consisting of planning, establishin g, managing and monitoring the transportation services and the housing support at eight CDF locations throughout the performance periods, to ensure quality support. The CDF Locations, Projected Start, and Projected End are as follows: Tooele, UT: Ongoing - - Mar 2008;Anniston, AL: Nov 2002 -- Sep 2011; Umatilla, OR: Jul 2003 -- Apr 2011; Pine Bluff, AR: Apr 2004 --Apr 2011; Newport, IN: Jul 2003 - - Jan 2005; Aberdeen, MD: Mar 2003 -- Sep 2004; Pueblo, CO: Oct 2008 -- NLT Apr 2012; and Blue Grass, KY: Oct 20 09 -- NLT Apr 2012. Prior to initiation, the start dates are subject to frequent and often substantial changes. Likewise, the end dates are sub ject to change based on the progress made in destroying chemical weapons at each location. Normally, these chang es have been slippage into the future. DTRA's intent is to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with an ordering period of approximately ten (10) years. The orders will be placed either on a firm fixed price, cost plus fixed fee,  cost plus award fee, or time and mate rial basis. The total contract value is estimated to be $55 million. The estimated total cost for the escort services is $24 million and for the housing is $27 million.  A DRAFT solicitation is scheduled to be release d on or about October 7, 2002 allowing industry comments and recommendations to be submitted to DTRA no later than October 21, 2002.  The formal solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about the week of October 28, 2002 with a proposal due date of o n or about November 29, 2002.  The DRAFT solicitation will contain information for submittal of industry comments and recommendations on the DRAFT Request for Proposal DTRA01-03-R-0001.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a 30 month, incrementally funded cost reimbursable contract for all modifications to the Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) vertical launch missile to achieve torpedo tube launch capabilities in the Block IV missile.  This new capability will equip submarine fleets in both the United States and the United Kingdom with this torpedo tube launch capability.  This program will extend the capabilities of the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon System (TTWS) currently being developed under AP (AIR)-28-085-005 (REV 7).  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734 -1337.  Since 1994, Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Block IV missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, the government believes RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs. However, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Turbo Commander model AC-690A, serial number 11153, FAA registration N53RF requires full maintenance support for the upcoming year. The aircraft's primary mission is as a survey platform for the National Weather Service's, National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center in Chanhassen Minnesota. Maintenance shall require the contractor to ensure minimal "out of service" or "down time" during the months of February, March, and April.  The airframe has 11,300 hours since new and engines have 2800 hours since overhaul. The aircraft meets the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet No. 2A4.  NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Tampa, Florida manages the aircraft, which is operated under Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The contractor's facility must be located within the operational area of the aircraft (North Central area of the United States). The contractor shall provide a full service, Fixed Base of Operations (FBO) that can support the Twin Commander aircraft. Labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities shall be located at the FBO to provide the Government with the most cost effective support package. The contractor/FBO shall provide, flight crew amenities, scheduled and un-scheduled maintenance, avionics, paint and interior, servicing, inspection and repair on an as needed basis.  The Government shall be responsible for scheduling all work against this contract. Once the aircraft arrives at the Contractor's facility, no work shall begin until AOC has given approval for such work to begin. Any additional work or discrepancies must have prior approval from AOC. The contractor shall provide a list of discrepancies/tear down inspection report to AOC.  The report shall include the extent of the inspection, condition found on all major components, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. The contractor will be responsible for all, FAA and AOC required, documentation to include, but not limited to, approval for return to service.  A government flight crew shall fly the aircraft to the contractor's facility. AOC and/or the flight crew shall notify the contractor as soon as the need for service, inspection, and repair has been identified. If requested, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the contractor's attention before award of the contract. Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $100,000.00 to cover the aircraft on which this work will be performed.  Before award of this contract, the contractor shall provide to the contracting officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained.  The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective for such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe or until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the contracting officer, whichever period is longer. The contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. The Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous at any time during the contract period.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, new surplus, overhauled, repaired, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft.  Parts and components in an "as removed" status will not be installed on the aircraft. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the Labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. PMA parts are acceptable.  The Contractor shall provide the industry standard implied warranty on all products and services. Contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the required services is an FAA approved repair station for the Twin Commander class aircraft, engines, accessories, and avionics. Authorization from Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation in Arlington, Washington is not required.  Offerors will be required to: demonstrate that they have maintained or repaired the same model aircraft within the past six months, submit a copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate or Twin Commander Service Center documentation, submit proof of insurance documentation, supply fuel under a pre-existing Government contract, have factory trained technicians on staff, and show the number of work shifts in a 24 hour day (non-over-time).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>DONALD B. ELLISON, CONTRACTING OFFICER, DESK 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095.
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an all in one package more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed all-in-one solution must meet all of the KPPs for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APPs are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the double tap feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A double tap feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength specification has been removed from the upcoming performance specification.  The performance specification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific wavelength; however, the visible laser system must meet the other requirements as detailed in the specification.   8b. Is class III b acceptable for high power (+100mw) mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8b:  See Performance Specification (Para.  2.1)  Tradeoffs will  be made between cost, performance, and laser safety requirements. QUESTION NO. 9:  This program is based on the SOPMOD M4 Carbine ORD.  However, Crane has established numerous other weapons as threshold weapons ( M14, M16, M249,M60, MK11, Mk 43, Mk 46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 Win Mag Sniper Rifle, M2.50 cal MG, and .50 cal Sniper rifles).  In reviewing the ORD, it would appear these other weapons are not threshold weapons. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 9:  The specification is currently under review.  We are awaiting feedback from the user community on this issue.  On 7 May 2001, USSOCOM broadened the scope of the SOPMOD Program to include all small arms organic to Special Operations Forces. QUESTION NO. 10:  With the numerous MDNS announcements, we have noted the anticipated close date as  30 AUG 02, however we are still unsure of the projected solicitation release date.   Can you please advise an estimated date accordingly or projected response time.  Given the high value of this program does the Government anticipate having a presolicitation conference? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 10  The estimated solicitation open date is 15 October 02 and the estimated solicitation close date is 15 Nov 02.  No pre-solicitation conference is planned. INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS CONCERNING THE VISIBLE BRIGHT LIGHT (VBL) FOLLOW: QUESTION NO. 11:  What ruggedization improvements in particular are you asking for?

ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 15:  See Performance Specification (Para. 6.5);   QUESTION NO. 16: The length of time of fire before reload for continuous fire.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 16: See Performance Specification for firing schedules. (Para.  3.4.4). QUESTION NO. 17:  What is the variety of amounts of light output from flood to narrow beam, the angle of dispersion that is needed, and the angle to which to confine the beam?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 17:  The specification is performance based.  Determining design parameters to meet the  performance level is the responsibility of the contractor.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 18:  What is the amount of run time required before the light fails, and the run time on current makes  and models.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 18:  There is no specific requirement for run time; however, a best value determination, with run time being a factor, will be made prior to contract award.  No run time data is available for current products. QUESTION NO. 19:  Is there a requirement for the number of batteries it takes to operate the light or the types of batteries that are preferred?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 19:  See Performance Specification (Para.  3.3.2.1.2.4) The specification requires the batteries to be commercially available; however, size, weight, and run time will factor into the best value determination. QUESTION NO . 20:  What is the required range the light is able to reach out to and the amount of light that the light is to be able to provide.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 20:  See Performance Specification (Para.  3.3.2.1.2.8) QUESTION NO. 21:  What are the types of controls that are needed.  Is the desire to have variable intensity from low to full bright, or to have preset intensities just click to the desired intensity.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 21:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.1.2.2) QUESTION NO. 22:  We make an LED light product that can meet military specs are we included in this?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 22:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.1.2.5)  The specification that will be published with the solicitation will be updated to replace the word bulb with the words light source to allow industry more flexibility in meeting the performance requiremen ts. INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS CONCERNING THE INTEGRATED POINTER/ILLUMINATOR MODULE (IPIM) FOLLOW: The solicitation was modified and no longer includes an IPIM as a requested system.  Proposals for combined functionality systems such as the IPIM will be considered.   INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS CONCERNING THE AN/PEQ-2 INFRARED LASER POINTER/ILLUMINATOR (ITPIAL) FOLLOW: QUESTION NO. 23:  What is the desired target range and what is the minimum distance needed to cover?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 23:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.1) QUESTION NO. 24:  What is the target run time that is desired?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 24:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.5) QUESTION NO. 25:   The request is for improved performance/reflectivity on green and black targets. What is the current effective range and what is t he desired practical range the user desires to have.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 25:  This requirement is for the visible laser, not the ITPIAL. QUESTION NO. 26:  We make green lasers.  Are we being included?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 26:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.4) for IR laser wavelength requirements.  There are no specific wavelength requirements for the visible laser; therefore, the specification neither requires nor precludes the use of a particular color visible laser.   QUESTION NO. 27:  What is the weight and size of the system that is currently being used?  What are the size weight targets?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 27:   The current system measures 6.4 in x 2.8 in x 1.2 in and weighs 7.5 oz with batteries.  No specific targets have been set.  The system should be packaged as small as possible to not sacrifice performance. QUESTION NO. 28:   What patterns are currently being used?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 28:  Square, Cross, Half-Circle, Triangle, and Circle QUESTION NO. 29:  How many more are needed?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 29:  We are requesting the capability to install interchangeable pattern generators. The number and type of pattern generators is still to be determined.  We anticipate quantities of pattern generators to be separate line items in the contract.  QUESTION NO. 30:  What pulse cycles are being used and what other cycles would be needed? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 30:  Currently, no pulsing is used.  We are requesting the capability to generate multiple operator-perceptible pulsing frequencies. QUESTION NO. 31:  What ruggedization improvements in particular are you asking for?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 31:  See Performance Specification (Para.  3.4) QUESTION NO. 32:  What are the make and mo dels of the systems that are currently being used?

ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 42:  Insight Technologies, Inc., Carbine Visible Laser, AN/PEQ-5, NSN: 5860-01-439-5409 QUESTION NO. 43:  What are the shortcomings that you want improved? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 43: See P erformance Specification, it describes the objective system.  QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPPs.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPPs are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for commercially available software tools affecting the verification of avionics software for commercial transport aircraft. The tools will be used in a research study of potential new criteria for tool qualification in compliance with RTCA/DO-178B "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certifications". The document, RTCA/DO-178B, is a publicly available standard from the RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics).

<DESC>PRELIMINARY SCOPE OF WORK:  1.  Radiological characterization of above and below grade piping.  It is suspected that there is considerable residual radioactivity in the pipes associated with this drainage system, but the actual extent and levels of this contamination are unknown.  The radiological constituents of potential concern (COPC) are 234U, 235U, 94Nb, 60Co, 137Cs, and 90Sr.  Pipe openings range from two inches to three inches in diameter.  Pipe diameters start 2 inches to 3 inches in diameter the openings and, through a series of transitions, progress to 6 inches when joining the main drainage line beneath the building.  

2.  Radiological characterization of ventilation ducting between Postmortem Cells and Basement Rooms 6 & 7. The two independent HEPA filtration systems were used to maintain negative pressure in the postmortem cell area while examinations and tests were preformed on the reactor fuel.  When operational, air was drawn into inlet vents situated on the sides of each of the postmortem cells, through ducting formed into the concrete walls and ceilings, through a series of HEPA filters located in the basement mechanical room (Rooms 6 and 7), and out through the two small stack located on the east side of the building.  Although not present, the mouth of the inlet vents are engineered for a prefilter that reduces the amount of contamination entering the ventilation system.  The effectiveness of the prefilters is undeterminable, but recent surveys show negligible removable contamination and fixed contamination of approximately 20,000 dpm/100 cm2 ? (.   The ventilation inlets and associated ducting needing characterization are 6 inch by 18 to 24 inch rectangular openings that penetrate strait down to the ceiling of the basement.  The greatest length for such ducting is 12 feet.  The COPC are the same as for the radiological drainage pipes.  

Method of characterization shall have the ability to identify all gamma emitting radionuclides between 100 KeV and 2 MeV and quantify the activity of each identified gamma emitting a radionuclide in each linear meter of pipe of ducting.  

A detail description of methods shall be provided to the Contractor 30 days in advance for proper development of work control documents.  A detailed training plan will be developed to show compliance with required training.


RADIOLOGICAL RELEASE, SURVEY, AND LICENSE REQUIREMENTS:  
1.  Subcontractor must provide the Contractor with a radiological survey of all equipment before transporting to the Nevada Test Site.  Contractor?s Health Physics Department will verify that contamination levels are within current radiological control limits.  
2.  The Contractor will perform an initial radiological survey to verify radiological survey provided by Subcontractor before works begins.  
3.  Subcontractor work plan will show how equipment will be decontaminated.  
4.  Subcontractor must possess the necessary license to receive equipment in the case decontamination of Subcontractor equipment proves ineffective.  If such a license can not be produced, contaminated equipment will remain in the possession of the Contractor.  

LOGISTICS:  -Site access is available from 0700 hrs to 1630 hrs.
-Temporary site access badges will be issued for duration of job to subcontract personnel.  -The Contractor (BN) will provide all PPE.  -The Contractor (BN) will dispose of all low-level waste generated.

EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES:  Identified by Subcontractor

REQUIRED TRAINING:  
Current OSHA 40-hour HAZWORKER Training.  
Rad Worker II.  
Hantavirus Awareness (provided by Contractor).  
Hazard Communication (provided by Contractor).  
Personnel Protective Equipment (provided by Contractor).

<DESC>NA Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)  Software and  Support  for DLA/Army THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Department of Defense (DoD) has mandated that the Services assess their business processes end-to-end and use Supply Chain Management techniques to increase the efficiency of the logistics system.  The US Army and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are pursuin g numerous initiatives that are designed to enhance the overall logistics business processes and improve supply chain management.  These include Consumable Supply Chain Management-Army (CSCM-A) and others.  This DoD Supply Chain Management Defense Informat ion Infrastructure (DII) project will focus on the joint initiative (CSCM-A) between the US Army and the DLA.  The CSCM-A DII project is envisioned as an evolutionary transformation and integration of the supply chains between DLA providers and Army users.   CSCM-A plans to accelerate Army and DLA compliance with the DoD mandate to assess the end-to-end business process for supply chain management (PBD 422) through a live on-site pilot at one Army installation.  This pilot will focus on the integration and a cceleration of the enterprise by ensuring that integration with DLAs BSM release is accomplished.  As part of the live assessment pilot, an evaluation and subsequent modifications to business processes will define the future operational architecture suppo rting integration of DLA and Army supply chains.  Once this proposed Operational Architecture is developed, a System Architecture utilizing Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) technology will be defined to integrate emerging DLA and Army ERP initiativ es (i.e. WLMP, BSM and GCSS-Army).   Specifically, CSCM-A will be an EAI-based commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solution to connect and interact with multiple legacy and ERP systems to exchange current and future data transfers.  Selection of the applicable EAI shall be based on cost,  compatibility, implementation timelines and ability to adapt to Military Standards (MILS), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and open standards such as HTTP, XML, and SSL.  Additionally, the selected software will be scalable and will function on a TCP/I P network.  Desirable features include the following:  Compatible with an Intel-based processor and a Microsoft operating system; remotely accessible via a secure TCP/IP VPN connection for programming, monitoring and operations.  In addtion, preference wil l be given to products that are capable of operating in a network environment, on a single processor (server), without using EAI client modules on connecting network nodes. Standard product brochures with additional written text addressing specified requirements will be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, however, additonal written product technical text will not exceed five pages. Promotional or  advertisment disks or CDs that include demonstrations, trail versions, evaluation copies and/or screen shots are encouraged.  In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide a list of names and phone numbers of references of installed users and  a list of business or consulting partners.  Contractors should also provide their product sales by total quantity of software packages sold, for the current software version and per year since the product was introduced.  In addition, contractors should i ndicate any DoD, DLA, Army or supply chain management sales experience and note any applicable consulting expertise or experience.  Submissions must include complete price lists for product, add-ons, warranties, support and annual fees, if any.  Submission s without price lists will not be considered.   All submitted text material will be in both hard copy and electronic form as Microsoft Word (.DOC) or Adobe Acrobat (.PDF) formats.   The Army reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. All contractors that wish to respond must provide their point-of-contact email address to EAISSS@mtccouncil.com as soon as possible in order to receive any possible information updates.  Responses to  the above should be submitted to Tom Watkins, 198 Fulbright Court, Severna Park, MD 21146.  Email queries can be sent to EAISSS@mtccouncil.org. Submissions must be received no later than October 25, 2002.   No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>OLVIMS Sources Sought Synopsis Request Number F01620-03-R0001.  This is a sources sought synopsis.  No solicitation is available at this time.   Request for solicitation will not receive a response.  Currently, the Air Force has a set of stand-alone legacy systems (AFIS, MAFIS, DAFIS, and OLVIMS) that meet the functionality of determining vehicle requirements, allocating vehicles, generating and tracking work orders, and accounting for labor and material cost. However, the Air Force needs a modern system that merges the stand-alone legacy systems that not only allows for vehicle dispatch, work order management, and vehicle repairs; but one that allows for simple self-service to the end-user and the mechanic, better vehicle forecasting, improved reliability of its vehicle fleet, and proactive management of costs enabling better budget formulation and execution. The Air Force is migrating to solutions that are platform independent and fully web architected for optimized performance over Intranet and Internet mediums.  The Air Force needs a Vehicle Management and Maintenance system that meets a wide range of needs in two areas; the right architecture and the right functionality.  The Air Force is seeking potential sources capable of providing a pilot that will determine if a COTS solution meets its  needs or if there is a gap in needed functionality.  The vendor must demonstrate the product is scalable (a reference account with at least as many assets as the AF (200,000). The product offered must be mature and commercially available web-architected, J2EE compliant, includes workflow, AIT/wireless capability,  non-proprietary (open APIs) and must be compliant with the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) architecture including working with Policy Director (IBM), Oracle 9iAS or WebSphere 4.0 application server, a 9i Database, and can support the use of a Discover OLAP tool.. The product must support XML.  It should be configurable to meet OLVIMS system functionality without major re-coding.  Interested vendors should submit their capabilities information to HQ SSG/PKZ-2, Ms. MaryLou Cannon, 490 East Moore Drive, Suite 270, MAFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114-3004.  The submission should include the past performance history for the last two years for similar projects that are complete or near complete with a customer point of contact and phone number.  Submissions must specify whether the firm is a large business or small business and fill out and submit FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items along with its response.    Also, specify if the firm is U.S. or foreign-owned.  All interested, responsible potential firms must submit their written responses NO LATER THAN  COB/1600 CST ON October 17, 2002.  The Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>B--Special Studies and Analysis - not R&D
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water seeks to procure, on an other than full and open competition, analytical support services for a single sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry  Products Industry from a single source.  The single source is  Pacific Analytical, Inc. (PAI), 6056 Corte del Cedro, Carlsbad, CA 92009.  PAI  is  the only  laboratory  currently with the demonstrated capability and experience in analyzing samples by the required  methods (and associated method modifications that are specified in the SOW) and reporting data electronically in accordance with the EPA-specified  format . EPA requires analysis of approximately 19 industrial wastewater samples, 2 matrix spikes, and 2 matrix spike duplicates  for pesticides/herbicides  by various EPA methods to include 632 and 1660.   EPA will use the analytical data provided under this purchase order to develop industrial effluent discharge regulations that govern the disposal of pollutants  from Meat and Poultry  Products Industry sources;  therefore, data produced under this purchase order must be of highest possible quality.  Laboratories will be required to employ a comprehensive quality assurance program, meet facilities and equipment requirements, and provide  personnel that demonstrate technical expertise in analytical chemistry techniques. 

The sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry Products  Industry, Episode 6486, is scheduled to be collected during the week of  November 11, 2002.   It is anticipated that samples will arrive at the laboratory each day from Tuesday,  November 12, 2002 through Saturday,  November 16, 2002.  The laboratory is required to meet a 30 day data turnaround from receipt of the last sample associated with Episode 6485 at the laboratory, unless dilutions and/or reanalyses are required.  If dilutions and/or reanalyses are required, the data turnaround time for the entire data package will remain at 30 days.  The laboratory must adhere to extraction and analytical holding times as stated in the methods.  PAI  has a minimum of  five years of  experience analyzing for  pesticides/herbicides parameters using the required EPA methods, and has Method Detection Limits (MDLs) and Initial Precision and Recovery (IPR) data on-file at EPA.  Start-up tests requiring significant time and effort would be required from other labs.  Analytical conditions of the instrument must be adjusted so that undistorted spectra are produced.  Further, other laboratories would need to invest significant time and effort in developing the necessary data delivery software to submit data electronically in the format required by EPA.  The process of new laboratory start up would also involve a significant expenditure of EPA resources (at least 80 hours) to bring the laboratories up to speed.   EPA requires these services within four weeks' time.  This time would be insufficient to bring any other laboratories "up to speed" and ensure that EPA would receive the high quality data needed to support effluent guidelines regulatory development for the Metal and Poultry Products  Industry.  This procurement is being conducted   under the simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and other than full and open competition in accordance with (41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1)) and FAR 6.302-1 . This notice of intent is not a request  for competitive proposals.   Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Linda Merryman  at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2115 or by e-mail (merryman.linda@epa.gov) which establishes that their technical qualifications meet the  EPA's requirement.  Anticipated award date is October 23, 2002,  therefore, documentation must be received  October 10, 2002.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<SUBJECT>--Performance of system vapor testing on thirty-one (31) Chemical/Biological (CB) protective suits.
<DESC>NA The US Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contract Division, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (USA SBCCOM), intends to conduct negotiations and award a purchase order to the Royal Military College of Canada (RM C), Ontario, Canada on the basis of other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1.   This acquisition has two phases:  Phase I:  This phase involves the performance of system vapor testing on thirty-one  (31) Chemical/Biological (CB) protective suits for vapor permeation in a Man-In-Simulant Test (MIST) Chamber, and to provide quantitative assessment of the chemical protective performance of selected clothing systems in order to guide chemical protective clothing selection and development for the military.  The main purpose of these tests is to compare Selectively-Permeable Membrane (SPM) suits with commercially-available suits for their resistance to vapor-simulant permeation.  Eight (8) Selectively-Perme able Membrane (SPM) suits, 16 air-permeable suits, and 7 air-impermeable suits shall be tested for their resistance to vapor-simulant permeation.   Phase II:  This phase involves the same testing as Phase I for second generation SPM suits, with additional testing of various previously tested ensembles as required based on initial test outcomes and contingent upon facility availability.  The total number of suits tested during Phase II shall not exceed sixteen (16).  SBCCOM will provide the complete equipmen t ensembles to be evaluated, including respirator, chemical protective gloves, chemical protective over boots, and chemical protective clothing.  SBCCOM will be responsible for the costs associated with shipping the government furnished property to the con tractor.  At the completion of all testing, the contractor will be responsible for all costs associated with cleaning all items and returning to SBCCOM.  Each ensemble shall be tested and reported upon within three months after receipt by RMC.
