<DESC>The United Stated Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) seeks information related to its Modernization effort.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  FSA intends to assess the capabilities and, if appropriate, issue an RFP at a later date.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.

BACKGROUND
Current Capability:

FSA’s Farm Program delivery is a complex suite of program applications that rely on a business model that is highly decentralized, labor-intensive, and facing technological obsolescence.  When the predecessors to today’s Farm Programs were originally created during the Great Depression, the goal was to provide local support to individual farming communities across the country.  To meet this need, USDA developed an extensive infrastructure of county-based Service Centers.  FSA continues to operate with this localized infrastructure despite advances in telecommunications and technology.  FSA customers depend on rapid access to Farm Program benefits to help them weather the challenges of running farming operations.  The “walk-in” Service Center business model and supporting technology cannot continue to fulfill FSA’s mandated mission.

The legacy technology platform is distributed, meaning that each county’s data is kept on the computers in its individual Service Center.  This prevents data sharing across program, geographical, and organizational boundaries, which in practical terms impedes FSA’s ability to enforce Program eligibility limitations and prevents FSA from balancing workload across Service Centers to address regional variances in workload.  The distributed environment also will not support web-enablement of processes and services in compliance with the President’s Management Agenda and e-gov initiatives.  

FSA has established three strategic goals in direct support of USDA’s mission.  They are:  
 
Strategic Goal 1:  Supporting productive farms and ranches; 
 
Strategic Goal 2:  Supporting secure and affordable food and fiber; and, 
 
Strategic Goal 3:  Conserving natural resources and protecting the environment. 
 
FSA Farm Programs directly supports these three goals through administration of over 30 programs that are designed to provide an equitable financial “safety net” for the nation’s farmers and ranchers.  These programs, authorized through the Farm Bill legislation, include direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, marketing assistance loans, loan deficiency payments, trade assistance payments, emergency/natural disaster payments, and soil/water conservation payments among others. 
 
Planned Capability:
As U.S. agriculture is now competing far beyond local markets, FSA’s customers need “real-time” access to their program participation processes to effectively compete in a global marketplace.  Pricing adjustments in the world market price for cotton, for example, can be the difference between profitability and foreclosure.  FSA is planning to create a parallel, e-government-based, service delivery channel that will function in synchronization with and in addition to the traditional service delivery available through USDA Service Centers.   

The Modernization effort will shift Farm Program delivery to a business-driven model that streamlines Service Center processes, centralizes and integrates Farm Program data, and leverages modern technology to enable Web user interface and utilize USDA’s geospatial technology.  This Modernization effort will implement a customer-centric, internet-accessible solution that provides farmers, ranchers and Agribusiness partners with tools to make doing business with the USDA less of a burden.

FSA is seeking information on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)* software packages that will provide automated farm program business delivery systems that ensure cost effective and efficient program delivery.  This COTS package should enable expedited compliance with Farm Bills and any other legislative mandates, and leverage USDA’s investment in geo-spatial and computing technologies.  Ideally, this software would have the following characteristics:

•	Object oriented
•	J2EE compliant 
•	Have modify capabilities and be extendable
•	Must be open, portable and flexible
•	Ability to handle large volumes of data and large numbers of users simultaneously
•	Allow for reporting capabilities
•	Be internet and intranet ready 
•	Must interface with the Agency’s eAuthentication solution and allow for role based security (see eAuthInfoAttachment 1)


Emerging Features/Functionality

FSA is seeking information on the following features/functionality:

Implementing "means" testing:

Required Features – software to capture and determine if an individual or an entity (partnership, joint venture, corporation etc.) is eligible to receive program benefits.  The test consists of quantifying the party’s income and or previously received benefits or a combination of both. 


Benefit computation based on defined business rules:

Required Features – software to capture the determination of a program participants benefits based on a predefined set of business rules for that program.


Recordation of land usage:   

Required Features – software to capture and determine how land is being utilized.

Securing of collateral:

Required Features – software to capture collateral for the purposes of securing a loan. 

Recordation of commodity characteristics:  

Required Features – software to store, organize, retrieve and expose commodity characteristics including intended uses, subclasses, crop types, crop statuses and irrigated practices.

Instructions to Prospective Offerors

Responses to this RFI must be no more than 20 total single-sided pages with print no smaller than 12 point; however, text included in graphics, tables, and figures can be smaller than 12 point.  The cover page, cover letter, and table of contents are not included in the 20-page count.  Responses should also include a Commercial price list or GSA schedule of license and maintenance fees along with Points of contact (including name, e-mail address, phone number, and fax number from any customers currently using the product).  The submission must be in sufficient detail and clarity to provide FSA with the information it needs to assess your company’s COTS software.  All information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and shall not be returned to the submitter.

Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later.

Offerors’ responses to the RFI must be submitted to FSA by 3:00 p.m. EST on July 21, 2006.  Your company should only contact the contracting office issuing this letter if there are questions about any aspect of this acquisition.

Description:

	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 6-3611-105-00864 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.   The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 334516.  

THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  The equipment must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications and Statement of Work:  1) tungsten-halogen light source; 2)  spectral detection range of at least 515 to 700 nm; 3)  a multiplex capability allowing 5  different targets to be assayed simultaneously;  4) a dynamic range spanning a minimum of 9 orders of magnitude;   5) a thermal uniformity across the block which does not exceed 0.4 degrees Celcius;  6)   a ramp rate of 3 degrees per second or less; and 7)  user-friendly software that allows rapid and accurate analysis of data , and is reasonably easy for new users to learn.  Software should be windows compatible.

Statement of Work:  The USDA/ARS, MWA, Soybean/Maize Germplasm, Pathology, Genetics Research Unit, Urbana, IL, has a requirement/need for a real-time or quantitative PCR thermal cycler to analyze both plant and pathogen DNA.  This machine would be used by personnel from various laboratory groups for a wide range of assays.  DNA from collected fungal spores would be tested to determine the presence and proportion of spores from Phakopsora pachyrhizi, the fungus which causes Asian soybean rust.  Quantitative PCR would allow discrimination between spores of      
P. pachyrhizi and those of P. meibomiae, a less virulent pathogen whose spores are morphologically indistinguishable from those of P pachyrhizi. cDNA derived from soybean RNA would be quantitatively analyzed to confirm changes in gene expression initially indicated by hybridization data from microarray analyses.  This would help to elucidate genes and proteins involved in pathogen recognition and plant responses to pathogen infections

<DESC>This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s) is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

<SOLNBR>CPSC-Q-06-0068
<RESPDATE>071006
<ARCHDATE>07122006
<CONTACT>Donna  Hutton, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 504-7009, Fax (301) 504-0628, Email dhutton@cpsc.gov
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate for a specific make and model in accordance with FAR  6.302-1(c) with the manufacturer and/or authorized dealers of Rosemount Analytical Inc to procure two Rosemount Model Z-A-9-4-V-P-4-3 analyzers, with an option to purchase one or more additional analyzers during the current or next fiscal year.  Purchase of this make and model is required in order to maintain part interchangeability and standardization with other Rosemount gas analyzers currently in use.  Delays in testing could place consumers at risk if there is a delay in notifying the public that a hazard exists with a particular gas-fired product.  Therefore, it is critical that the gas analyzers be completely interchangeable between test setups to minimize variability in test data and minimize downtime.  Analyzers must be configured to match current Rosemount MLT 4 multi-component gas analyzers to measure five gases simultaneously: CO, CO2, CH4, CO (a second CO channel), and O2.  Each gas component is measured on a different channel, and each channel has four ranges.  The following are the minimum and maximum ranges for each gas component: CO, 0-200 ppm & 0-5000 ppm; CO2, 0-5% & 0-100%; CH4, 0-1% & 0-10%; O2, 0-5% & 0-100%.  Data variability must be minimized by using the same sensor technology as the Rosemount MLT 4 multi-component gas analyzers which is the use of individual non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors to measure CO, CO2, and CH4, and a paramagnetic sensor to measure O2.  For data consistency, the NDIR sensors must have a detection limit of less than or equal to 1 % FS (full scale), a linearity of less than or equal to 1 % FS, a repeatability of less than or equal to 1 % FS, a zero-point drift of  less than or equal to 2 % FS per week, and a span drift of less than or equal to 0.5 % FS per week.  The paramagnetic sensor must have a detection limit of less than or equal to 1 % FS, a linearity of less than or equal to 1 % FS, a repeatability of less than or equal to 1 % FS, a zero-point drift of  less than or equal to 2 % FS per week, and a span drift of less than or equal to 2 % FS per week.  Because the gas analyzers are mounted between other analyzers and equipment on a standard 19-inch rack, the replacement gas analyzers must be able to fit into the space occupied by a Rosemount MLT 4.  The front panel of the replacement gas analyzers can be no higher than 5.25 inches (3U panel height) and the length of the gas analyzer can be no longer then 19.5 inches.  Because the gas analyzers are wired to a data acquisition system, the type of the analog output signal and the electrical connection for the output signal must be identical to our current Rosemount MLT 4 gas analyzers and these analog output signals are as follows: 0-10 VDC and a DB25F connection with the following pin assignment: Pin 1, channel 1 (CO); Pin 3, channel 2 (CO2); Pin 7, channel 3 (CH4); Pin 9, channel 4 (CO); and Pin 14, channel 5 (O2). No telephone solicitation requests well be accepted.  To be eligible for consideration, offerors must be certified, authorized Rosemount dealers and must offer the exact model specified.  Authorized Rosemount dealers may submit company information to DHutton@cpsc.gov on or before July 10, 2006.

This market survey is to locate potential sources of supply for the described Light Emitting Diode Arrays (LEDAs) that the Government proposes to procure on a 5-year, Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract. These LEDAs are 1st Generation Forward Looking Infrared (1st Gen FLIR) Common Modules used in legacy  US Army systems such as the Pilot Night Vision Sight and Target Acquisition Designation System deployed on the Apache Helicopter. First Gen IR represents a mature product line with a declining market demand due to emerging 2nd Generation FLIR technology. The data possessed by the Government for these LEDAs consist of the Top Assembly Drawing (TAD) and associated drawings for each LEDA, and a common Military Performance Specification. Since this is the only data owned by the Government, the contractor must be prepared on the basis of this data to deliver LEDAs that meet performance requirements in cited legacy systems.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis a requirement for services to initiate and train DoD personnel from all combatant commands, services and certain governmental agencies on the classified Secret applications: Common Operational Picture-Joint (COP-J) and Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3).  Services will be required for a period of one year from date of contract award.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Systems Research and Applications (SRA) Corp., Fairfax, VA for this requirement.  The work to be performed is integrally related to the work that SRA has performed and continues to perform in the installation and configuration of the Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) computer systems under contract FA4452-03-C-0001.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an inertial sensing system to measure linear acceleration and angular rates during dynamic testing. The system includes one each MotionPak Multi Axis Inertial Sensing System and two each MotionPak Multi-Axis Inertial Sensing Systems, 6 Degrees of Freedom with three QRS11 Quartz Rate Sensors and three accelerometers.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from BEI Systron Donner Inertial Division, the only known responsible source.	NASA LaRC currently owns Systron Donner multi-axis motion pack sensors that were used in the August, 2005 Free-Flight test in the Full-Scale Tunnel.  The same motion pack sensors are currently installed in a model being tested on a new dynamic forced oscillation test rig mounted in the 12-Foot Low-Speed Tunnel.   Wind tunnel time histories from our current multi-axis motion pack sensors and a strain gauge balance are being measured and used to develop control laws, and simulation studies for a large variety of designs, vehicles and motions.  The BEI Systron Donner Inertial Division systems to be purchased will be compatible with the existing hardware and software developed by NASA LaRC.   This commonality will allow a smooth and timely instrument transition, a minimum increase in tunnel test schedule and the required data instrument range to complete current and future projects.	Purchase of other than the BEI Systron Donner Inertial Division systems would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   The sole source authority for this item is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 10, 2006.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract, on an other than full and open competition basis, with MRL Industries, 19500 Nugget Road, Sonora, CA 95370 for the in-house upgrade of an existing NRL owned low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) furnace system to provide silicon oxide thin films. The upgrade is to be made to the MRL Industries Model 6500 795 856 R00  dual-stack furnace system presently configured with a lower tube for silicon nitride/polysilicon LPCVD and an upper tube configured for atmospheric pressure wet-oxidation of silicon. The upgrade of the present dual stack configuration will convert the high-temperature wet-oxidation furnace to a low-temperature oxide (LTO) furnace and utilize components of the wet-oxidation furnace to construct a stand-alone bench-top high-temperature wet-oxidation furnace.

                                      WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA


The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to G. W. Forum Partners, LLC.   The extension will be for 18,927 rentable square feet of fully serviced space and seventy-four parking spaces for a term of twelve months.

The government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a remediation project in a Federal Building can be completed and occupancy takes place in a newly leased building.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government’s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within fourteen (14) days of the publication of this notice.

Reponses are due by the close of business July 11, 2006

SSA intends to negotiate solely with TIS America, Inc., 591 North Avenue, 3 Lakeside Office Park, Wakefield MA, 01880, for eFlow Freedom Software, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) â€œSoliciting from a Single Source.â€  SSA needs one (1) copy of this software, which include 3 FreeProcessing stations (OCR), 2 FreeMatch stations, 2 Freedom Completion stations and 3 Elite engine package â€“ 100cps (AEG, Recostar, JustICR), and 12 months of maintenance,  in order to enhance the current scanning process.  The product is the only one capable of reading formatted documents in free-form which is also compatible to the TIS software currently being used by SSA for document scanning.  Other similar software products were considered, but those will not interface with current scanners and software in which SSA has a substantial investment of time and money. The place of performance is Social Security Administration, 1150 East Mountain Blvd, Wilkes-Barre, PA 18702. The period of performance is 12 months from date of acceptance by the government.  In addition to allowing SSA to improve its scanning processes, the order will provide ongoing maintenance support.  TIS is the only source known to the government that is capable of providing software capable of providing these enhancements and the ability to interface with current system.  This is a Notice of Intent only, not a solicitation.  When responding to this announcement, respondents should refer to TISâ€™s eFlow Freedom Software products.   Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) memorandum dated April 17, 2006 regarding the publication of Brand Name Justifications, the solicitation, to be issued to TIS America only, along with the corresponding  justification is being published and will be available via FedBizOpps on or about the time this announcement is published.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis, the continued consulting and facilitation services of Dr. Marianne H. Alciati Ph.D. of Management Solutions for Health, Inc., 1600 Waters Edge Lane, Reston, VA 20190. The ARP is leading an NCI effort to explore the feasibility of a national randomized controlled trial of the role of weight control through physical activity and/or reductions in caloric intake on breast cancer risk.  A two-day workshop was held on March 15 and 16, 2006 and was co-sponsored by the Division of Cancer Prevention, the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, the Center for Cancer Research, and the Office of Women’s Health.  The purpose of this workshop was to address the issue of whether evidence is sufficient to justify a randomized, controlled trial on the efficacy of a physical activity, weight control intervention for prevention of either second occurrence of breast cancer in survivors or primary occurrence in high-risk women. Workshop proceedings focused on presentation of evidence from existing studies as well as study design and implementation lessons.  This workshop provided an initial basis for assessing trial feasibility and potentially core trial characteristics. The outcome of the workshop is to be a summary document that contains the input and feedback provided during the meeting as well as input from participants afterwards on the issues related to a trial in this area.  Due to the dense agenda and need for the participants to thoroughly consider the trial elements proposed at the meeting, collecting and assembling feedback from participants after the workshop is essential to formulating a trial design.  Due to the complexity of the scientific question at hand, there were four separate working groups established to address the main issues in discussing the feasibility of a randomized control trial.  These were identified as the Interventions Working Group, the trans-NIH Working Group, the Population and Questions Working Group, and the Mechanisms of Action Working Group.  These groups have been identified and the working group members have been established.  The working groups have been meeting through bi-weekly conference calls to discuss issue frameworks that have been developed.  Working group members have also been participating in on-line discussions via email or through message boards that have been developed for specific topics.  Management Solutions for Health, Inc shall:  1) Manage and facilitate the progress of the four already established working groups in their development of a final report.  This will include:  	a)  continued identification of follow-up issues for the working group to address;  b)  organize submission and refinement of draft working group reports at each round of revision;  c)  coordinate and schedule any necessary conference calls for the working groups including development of the call agenda, related materials (frameworks, draft reports, etc.) and follow-up communication; and d)  compile references and track citations for 3 of the working groups (Populations and Questions Working Group, Mechanisms of Action Working Group, and the Interventions Working Group);  2) Coordinate the compilation of the final working group reports into one final report for all working groups.  This will include:  a) identify strategies for this consolidation across working groups;  b)  work with the working group co-chairs and NCI contacts to compile the reports into one document and providing editorial, review, and scientific expertise to the revisions of this document’  c) facilitate any conference calls that are needed for this stage of the project;  d) compile references across all the working groups for the final report; and e) identify strategies for presenting final decisions regarding trial design and assist in supporting the rationale for these decisions.  Dr. Alciati worked as the facilitator for the establishment of the working groups after the March workshop and coordinated the first several rounds of reviews of the working group frameworks under Purchase Order # 263-MQ-606003.  She is extremely knowledgeable of and familiar with the composition of the working groups, the process for the conference calls, material development by the working groups, and the remaining scientific questions that need to be resolved in the development of the final working group reports.  Dr. Alciati’s work for the first part of the project was crucial in the management of the initial collection and synthesis of scientific input and evidence from over thirty experts in the field of cancer prevention.  She efficiently facilitated the development of draft working group reports and is uniquely familiar with the remaining scientific issues that the working groups need to address to develop the final working group reports.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 12, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to design and manufacture a cryogenic neutron filter system for the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer (MACS). This system is denoted the Monochromatic Cryo Filter Exchange system (MCFX). Specialized materials for neutron filtering will be delivered by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). When maintained at cryogenic temperatures, these materials have high transmission for low neutron energies but they are opaque for unwanted high energy neutrons. The role of the MCFX system is to maintain suitable filter materials at cryogenic temperatures and to hold them in correct locations with respect to one another. By placing the cooled filter blocks between the sample and the detectors a background suppressing filter action is achieved. To avoid neutron transmission between filter blocks, interstitial volumes are filled with highly neutron absorbing material in the form of B4C cast into poly-urethane. 

The period of performance of the base Conceptual Design period shall be approximately 3 months from the date of award.  It is anticipated that two option periods will be included in the contract.  The Detailed Design period, option 1, shall be approximately 2 months from the date of option exercise.  The Manufacture, Assembly, and Test; option 2, shall be approximately 6 months from the date of option exercise.

This acquisition is expected to be unrestricted; therefore any interested offeror may submit a proposal.

A fixed-price contract is anticipated.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENT IS HEREBY CANCELED AND THE SOLICITATION RESCINDED. THIS TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED AND REISSUED AT A LATER DATE ON THIS WEBSITE.  This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s)rican Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

The selected sites will be developed, maintained and operated by qualified contractors.  The Louisiana Housing Task Force Program is a joint state and federally operated plan for temporary housing assistance.  For more information on this program, please contact FEMA Individual Assistance at 1-800-621-FEMA or visit the website at www.fema.gov/rrr/inassist.shtm.<br><br>
FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governments’ technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  The GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies’ guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of the sites in making a determination.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for intended use by the government.  Those persons responding with an expression of interest that meets these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the Solicitation for Offer will be considered for award.<br><br>
Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br><br>
- Parcels of land no smaller than one tenth (1/10) acre and no larger than 100 acres in size<br>
- Land that is cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to construction<br>

- Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements and any other necessary approvals for the government's intended use<br>
- Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations<br><br>
The expression of interest should include as a minimum the following information:<br><br>
1) Owner’s name, address, phone number, email address if available<br>
2) Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land<br>
3) Description of the land: size, physical characteristics and current use<br>
4) Location of the land: including the physical address, city & parish, and a small map<br>
5) Picture of the site<br>
6) If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner<br><br>

Please provide a return address.<br><br>
<b>SOLICITATION PROCESS:</b><br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  GSA will conduct multiple solicitations for land within Orleans Parish.  These parcels of land must meet the technical requirements that adequately accommodate travel trailers, mobile homes and other types of temporary housing units.  The leasing actions will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offers first.  GSA will continue to solicit offers until the requirement is satisfied. GSA will solicit as many offers as possible for this solicitation period in order to promote competition to the maximum extent practical.<br><br>  
<b>DELINEATED AREA:</b><br><br>
All properties offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within Orleans Parish, including the cities and towns located within the geographic area bounded by this parish, in the State of Louisiana.<br><br>
<b>LEASE TERM:</b>  12 to 36 Months.<br><br>

<DESC>Addendum to Presolicitation Notice:  A Sole Source Award is anticipated.  A 100 day completion period is required for receipt of vehicle at Contractors facility to completion and acceptance of RESET efforts.  Stewart & Stevenson, the OEM, has succes sfully performed the FMTV RESET effort at their Sealy, TX production facility since February, 2004.   As the OEM, they have the requisite knowledge and expertise necessary to both rebuild and reconstitute or make the vehicles serviceable for return back to  the units within the required 100 day time period.   Model quantities, delivery schedules and vehicle conditions are indefinite and unknown.   Assuming a source other than the OEM is awarded the contract; production lead times could be as great as 24 months.  There are five models of the LMTV Vehicle: M1078 Cargo, M1081 Cargo LVAD, M1079 Van, M1078A1 Cargo & M1079 A1 Van;  and 18 Models of the MT V Vehicle: M1083 Cargo, M1093 Cargo LVAD, M1084 Cargo W/MHE, M1088 Tractor, M1089 Wrecker, M1090 Dump, M1094 Dump LVAD, M1085 Cargo LWB; M1086 Cargo LWB w/MHE, M1083 A1 Cargo, M1084A1 Cargo w/MHE, M1088A1 Tractor, M1089A1 Wrecker, M1086A1 Cargo LWB w/MHE, M1085A1 Cargo LWB, M1090A1 Dump, XM1087A1 5T Expansible Van and XM1148 Load Handling System.  Although there is extensive commonality within the system, several unique configurations are technically complex.  Numerous running changes have been incorporated  into the fleet during eighteen years of production.   Based on historical experience with this process, it could take up to 12 months to complete production verification testing, analysis and documentation in order to release various configurations of eac h truck/trailer back to the field.  Acquisition of long lead items could require another 12 months. In accordance with Numbered Note 22, which was included in the Presolicitation Announcement, the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of  publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received wil l normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered notes 8, 13 & 26 still apply.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact), as described below, to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement for 30 sets of Lawson Dual Model 401 23-bit A/D acquisition systems with Ethernet-based communications that allow combining two Model 401 systems, for a total of four channels, acquisition rate of 100 Hz, external triggering, and date time stamping of serial time stream from Trimble Thunderbolt digital clock, external 32 bits of digital data from fluxgate magnetometer.  These systems must be totally compatible with existing PCDCP software, Narod fluxgate Magnetometer, and Trimble Thunderbolt Clock, and mounted in a non-magnetic chassis.  Because of the need for total compatibility of all components and software, it has been determined that the Lawson Dual Model 401 is the only system that can meet USGS requirements.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Lawson Labs, Inc., 3217 Phoenixville Pike, Malvern, Pennsylvania, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>PEPFAR Liaison for HIV/AIDS Prevention
	USAID/Dominican Republic
	
BACKGROUND
The Dominican Republic (DR) has a population of 9,200,000, 42% of whom live below the poverty line (World Bank Report). Approximately 65% of the Dominican population live in urban areas. The country shares the Island of Hispaniola with Haiti (the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere) and approximately 800,000 to 1,000,000 poor Haitians have migrated -- mostly illegally -- to work in the DR in the sugar cane fields, in agriculture and in construction.
  
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the DR is considered to be generalized.  The national HIV seroprevalence for 2002 was estimated at 1% of the general population, with a 5% rate for people living in Bateyes (DHS 2002).  Tuberculosis is the principal opportunistic infection, and 9% of all TB patients have been found to also be HIV positive.  It is estimated that 24% of all persons living with AIDS have also contracted TB.

 The Dominican Republic is a non-focus PEPFAR country with USG funding of more than six million dollars per year.  Besides USAID, USG agencies with HIV/AIDS funds include the Peace Corps and the Department of Defense programming.  USAID also has special funding to provide support to the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM).   The DR has obtained a US$25 million World Bank Loan and a US$47 millions Global Fund Grant to fight HIV/AIDS, plus a US$8 million grant to support the control of Tuberculosis.  Other international organizations present in the DR include:  PAHO, UNICEF, UNAIDS, UNDP, Columbia and Brown Universities and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation. They provide support and technical assistance to the GODR National AIDS Program (DIGECITSS), and implementing partners.

For fiscal year 2007, all PEPFAR countries with funding over $5 million will be required to complete modified Country Operational Plans (mini-COPs).  The DR mini-COP is due November 15th, 2006.  In preparation for the mini-COP, we will draft scopes of work and seek technical assistance from OGAC Interagency Technical Working Groups on: most at risk populations (MARPS); Gender and Violence, Prevention and public/private partnerships and TB/HIV co-infection. Recommendations from these task forces will be incorporated in the mini-COP, as appropriate.  A scope of work for CDC to assess the DR surveillance systems, make recommendations, and present a two-year operating plan is currently  under  discussion.  It is expected that the CDC evaluation will take place during the summer. 

 In view of the priority given to the HIV/AIDS program and PEPFAR requirements, the DR and OGAC have identified the need to contract a USPSC for a short term assignment.

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The incumbent will be the principal country liaison with OGAC, and will be responsible for responding to all PEPFAR requirements for the HIV/AIDS technical team.  He/She will coordinate with the HIV/AIDS Technical team to ensure that PEPFAR policies and reporting requirements are carried out appropriately and in a timely fashion. He/she will also establish and maintain a highly collaborative relationship with the USG HIV/AIDS Team.  The incumbent will report to the USAID/DR Heath and Population Team Leader and will work closely and collaboratively with the USAID Activity Manager for HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis.

<RESPDATE>070706
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer, Kurtis L Kihn (760) 830-5118
<DESC>Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 (VMU-1) has determined that a realistic crew simulator that incorporates specific features that includes stations for the Internal Pilot, Payload Operator, and Mission Commander, the External Pilot, an Intelligence Specialist, and an Imagery Analyst.  VMU-1’s desired end state is a simulator that realistically replicates Pioneer unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions for all crew members from pre-flight through post-flight and enables training across the broad spectrum of conflict from low-intensity counterinsurgency operations to a major regional war. The crew simulator should include the following seven PC-based stations. Master Station.  The Master Station should enable the Master Station Operator (not the Mission Commander) to control the simulation by injecting friendly, enemy, and neutral units and actions as well as environmental conditions.  The Master Station should: Enable the Master Station Operator to communicate with all other stations via VOIP and the Mission Commander Station, Intelligence Specialist Station, and Imagery Analyst Station via Microsoft Internet Relay Chat (MIRC), Enable the Master Station Operator to view simulated payload video, Enable the Master Station Operator to view simulated Falconview/Pioneer Digital Map System (PDMS), Enable the Master Station Operator to inject aircraft emergencies, ground control station, and communication system failures, and Enable the Master Station Operator to perform the roles of external units and agencies that the VMU crew interacts with throughout the conduct of the mission such as: The Supported Unit.  In this role the Master St!  ation Operator tasks the VMU crew to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance of desired targets, areas of interest, et cetera and clears fires against targets that the VMU crew detects and identifies. Aviation Command and Control Agencies.  In this role the Master Station Operator provides the VMU crew with information pertaining to other airspace users for integration and deconfliction purposes. Artillery Batteries.  In this role the Master Station Operator “fires” artillery at targets that the VMU crew detects and identifies. Attack aircraft.  In this role the Master Station Operator “fires” precision-guided munitions at targets that the VMU crew detects and identifies.  The Scenario Builder Toolkit feature so that the VMU can independently tailor training scenarios as required.  Mission Commander Station.  The Mission Commander Station should enable the operator to: Communicate with all other stations via VOIP and the Master Station, Intelligence Specialist Station, and !  Imagery Analyst Station via Microsoft Internet Relay Chat (MIRC), View  simulated payload video, and View simulated Falconview/Pioneer Digital Map System (PDMS). Internal Pilot Station.  The Internal Pilot Station should enable the operator to: Communicate with the other stations via VOIP; View simulated payload video; Complete all Internal Pilot system presets and checklists from pre-engine start to recovery; Operate the simulated Pioneer UAV as from the Replacement Ground Control Station (RGCS); Receive control of the simulated Pioneer UAV from the External Pilot Station after post-launch operational checks; and Transfer control of the simulated Pioneer UAV to the External Pilot Station for recovery.  External Pilot Station.  The External Pilot Station should simulate the perspective of an External Pilot standing parallel to the center of the launch/recovery area as he or she operates the simulated Pioneer UAV during launch, flight in the local pattern, and recovery.  The station should enable the operator to: Communicate via with the other s!  tations via VOIP; Complete all External Pilot system checklists from pre-engine start to recovery; Operate the simulated Pioneer UAV as from the Co-Pilot Box and Student Box; Launch the simulated Pioneer UAV via conventional takeoff, rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO), and pneumatic takeoff; Fly the simulated Pioneer UAV in the local pattern during launch, post-launch operational checks, and recovery; Transfer control of the simulated Pioneer UAV to the Internal Pilot Station after post-launch operational checks; Receive control of the simulated Pioneer UAV from the Internal Pilot Station prior to recovery; Transfer control of the simulated Pioneer UAV to the Student Box; and Receive control of the simulated Pioneer UAV from the Student Box. Payload Operator Station.  The Payload Operator Station should enable the operator to: Communicate with the other stations via VOIP; Complete all Payload Operator system presets and checklists from pre-engine start to recovery; View simulat!  ed payload video; Control the simulated POP-300 payload in electro-opt ical mode, black-hot infrared mode, and white-hot infrared mode; and Illuminate targets with the simulated POP-300’s infrared pointer. Intelligence Specialist/Imagery Analyst Station.  Two Intelligence Specialist/Imagery Analyst Stations are required, though the capabilities of each are identical.  These stations should enable the operators to:  Communicate with all other stations via VOIP and the Master Station and Mission Commander Station via Microsoft Internet Relay Chat (MIRC); View simulated payload video; Collect and annotate still imagery from the simulated payload video; and View simulated Falconview/ Pioneer Digital Map System (PDMS). Scenario Builder Toolkit.  Because vehicle and equipment recognition and identification is a mission-critical skill for VMU crews, the Scenario Builder Toolkit should pay particular attention to the authenticity of friendly, neutral, and enemy vehicles and equipment as they appear through the simulated payload in both EO and IR modes.!    Behavior Logic.  Simulator behavior logic should enable units/vehicles/personnel to automatically complete actions and interact without input from the Master Station Operator.  For example, a convoy moving through an urban area should automatically react to and interact with traffic or a friendly force that encounters an enemy force should automatically engage it, et cetera.  The intent is to create a simulated battlespace wherein the VMU crew can conduct its mission against a realistic “backdrop” of combatant and noncombatant activity.  Movement.  Unit/vehicle movements should be commensurate with the environment through which they move (i.e. travel faster on a hard surface road than on a dirt road or unimproved surface.)  Actions.  The Master Station Operator should be able to command units/vehicles/personnel to perform the following actions which, once activated, will continue until the action is completed as directed, the unit/vehicle/personnel encounters hostile acti!  on and reacts to it, or the Master Station Operator directs the unit/v ehicle/personnel to complete a different action.  The following actions are essential for realistic training: Attack.  Command selected units/vehicles/ personnel to attack selected units/vehicles within a selected area of the battlespace.  Convoy.  Command selected vehicles to move together from a point of origin to a series of designated waypoints and to a selected final destination.  Cordon-and-Search.  Command selected units to cordon-off a selected area and search each building within the selected area.  Emplace an IED.  Command selected personnel to emplace an improvised explosive device (IED) at a selected location. Helicopterborne Insert.  Command a selected unit to move via helicopter to a selected area of the battlespace and then disembark the helicopter. Patrol.  Command selected units/vehicles to conduct a mounted or dismounted patrol of a selected area. Raid.  Command a selected unit to raid a selected building/area for a designated period of time and then withdr!  aw to a predetermined area. Suicide Attack.  Command selected personnel to conduct the following types of suicide attack: Suicide Vehicle-Borne IED (SVBIED)and Suicide Vest.  Vehicle Checkpoint.  Command selected units to conduct a vehicle checkpoint at a selected area.  Terrain Database.  While the terrain database should be upgradeable in the future to allow training in various locations to include the Middle East.

<CONTACT>Jim Knesel, phone 301 744-6886, email james.e.knesel@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Portable Imaging Equipment (PIE) capable of detecting and identifying explosives and/or firing train components in parcels and small containers.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify sources and solicit vendor information that fully defines their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance.  This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, to procure equipment or services.  A solicitation is not planned at this time. This announcement is only an expression of interest.  Future requirements and procurements are uncertain.  BACKGROUND: NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select PIE systems for testing and evaluation.  Currently, EOD technicians use the Advanced Radiographic System (ARS) to image parcels and objects of concern.  The current ARS is becoming logistically unsupportable due to obsolescence.  It is less exp!  ensive to replace the current ARS with an upgrade than it is to repair due to replacement parts shortages.  These shortages have led to price increases for replacement parts.  Currently, there is an ECP to address current issues and provide a short-term solution.  The Future Radiographic System (FRS) will be a follow-on project to replace the ARS as a mid- and long-term solution.  Current technologies being explored are: Single Sided Visual Systems, Camera/Digital X-Ray Combination Systems, CMOS Portable High Resolution Digital X-Ray, Self-Developing Radiographic Film, Three Dimensional Tomography Imaging Systems, Image Interpreter Programs, Image Gradual Intensity Programs, Ultrasound, Thermal Imagers, Thermal Infrared Cameras, and Magnetic Response Imaging.  REQUIRED INFORMATION: Interested firms are encouraged to respond by providing a technical description of five pages or less in the following format: 1.0 General Information. 1.1 Vendor Information - company name, addr!  ess, point of contact, email address, telephone number, and related We bPages, if applicable. 1.2 PIE System - name and model. 1.3 Function - Objects of interest that PIE can inspect for (i.e., mail, small parcels, and personal bags). 1.4 System Picture - two photographs of PIE: a) oblique color photograph of instrument alone with key non-consumable accessories that will enable viewer to understand relative dimensions in inches, and; b) action photograph of PIE inspecting objects of interest. 1.5 Technology - a brief description of the technology used by this product consisting of the technology title and five or fewer descriptive sentences. 1.6 Output - samples of output produced directly by the PIE while in operation that identifies salient features in the object of interest (preferred examples of output are images, both real-time and post-processed).  2.0 PIE Performance Parameters - the following parameters measure PIE performance in inspecting representative containers, 2.1 Detection Effectiveness - measured as image quality and/or the abi!  lity of a relatively un-trained operators to correctly interpret the image and can include a percentage of the number of successful detections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected. 2.1.1 Successful Detections - includes: a) True Positives - PIE determines the presence of explosives or firing train components, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), when present; b) True Negatives - PIE determines that explosives and firing trains are not present when they are not present.  2.1.2 Unsuccessful Detections - includes: a) False Positives - PIE determines that there are explosives or firing train components present when explosives or firing train components are NOT present, and b) False Negatives - PIE determines that there are no explosives or firing train components present when explosives or firing train components ARE present.  2.2 Detection Speed - measured in analyzed objects per hour, is the number of objects of interest (firing train components, !  explosives) that can be fully inspected per hour, once the PIE is oper ational.  Inspecting time is defined as the minimum time interval possible between the start of an object imaging process to the next imaging process.  This includes the total time for an inspector to collect images from the item of interest, analyze data, and move to the next.  2.3 Ease of Use - is a subjective evaluation based on the responses of an operator survey, which assess the level of difficulty of operation.  2.4 Transportability/Portability - consists of two functions - transport of the main component of the PIE to the object of interest, and the physical movement of the PIE to allow analysis by the main component of the PIE.  This requirement will be assessed in terms of the time, manpower, and situational needs of operators manning the equipment.  2.5 Reliability - is measured by the degree that the PIE will complete the PIE mission without an operational mission failure for all objects requiring screening.  Inability of PIE to indicate the presence of possible !  explosives and/or firing train components constitutes an operational mission failure. 2.6 Maintainability (Mean Time Between Maintenance) - measured in hours, is the duration of time that, on average the PIE will function as designed without maintenance (beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies). 3.0 Standard Conditions and Threat - these standard conditions and representative Items of Concern (IoC) are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each of the PIE features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 3.1 Representative IoCs - shall be used as objects of interest that contain typical explosives that might convey through the Point of Entry.  The IoCs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in or on mail, small parcels, and personal articles.  3.2 Typical Operational Scenario – PIE will be used to non-intrusively inspect mail, small parcels,!   and personal articles.  3.3. Typical Environmental Conditions - will  have standard U. S. electrical power supply of 110V AC / 220V AC @ 50-60 Hz. Ambient weather / climatic conditions are expected to: a) range from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, b) range from 10 to 95% humidity, c) barometric pressure ranges from sea level to 3000 feet above sea level, and d) may contain saltwater spray, dust, rain, or snow. 3.4 Typical Operator Abilities - the operator is: a) a soldier, sailor, airman, marine or security personnel, b) supplied with vendor's written manuals, and c) trained by the manufacturer on the proper operation of the equipment. 4.0 System Description and Characteristics. 4.1 Size - outside dimensions in feet and inches. Weight of each component in pounds. 4.2. Limitations / Hazards / Special Requirements - State any special PIE limitations, hazards and/or special requirements beyond conditions stated herein, to include hazards such as radiation sources or toxic chemicals.  Include a copy of radioactive material license documentation from !  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, if applicable. 4.3 Special Features / Capabilities - Summarize any special PIE features or capabilities not contained herein that improve the overall ability of the PIE to find IoCs. State whether PIE has ability to detect other distinguishing characteristics unique to an IoC beyond those cited here. 5.0 Validated Test Results - summary of vendor and/or third party certifications and/or documented results of vendor test targets, testing and test protocols (additional published technical documentation may be submitted separately).   DEFINITIONS - PIE - Portable Imaging Equipment (for detecting and identifying explosive and firing train components whose main component is transportable.)  Detect - to determine the presence of a distinguishing phenomenon or physical characteristic of nature.  False Alarm Rate - the probability that a PIE classifies the object of interest as an explosive when no explosives are present.  Improvised Explosive Devices - an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb. Objects of Interest - the subject matter of attention, for example, mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. Performance Parameter - capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment.  Please address technical questions to Mr. Brian Downie at (301) 744-6858 x228, or e-mail at brian.downie@navy.mil.  SUBMISSION: Each submission shall be transmitted electronically to the POC e!  -mail address below, and one (1) hard copy to: Commanding Officer, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, 2008 Stump Neck Road, Bldg. 2112, Indian Head, MD, 20640-5070 (Attn.

<DESC>This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The DoD is interested in innovative solutions and potential costs per unit for a tactical flow meter assembly which meets the needs of tactical operations today and into the future.  The assembly will be used in a military tactical environment at fuel issue points and for custody transfer operations at fuel tank truck offloading facilities where large particulate contaminates are frequently found in the fuel.  

In most circumstances, fuel will pass through these meters via gravity feed or be pulled from several off-loading headers via a common pump that will be located downstream of the meter. The meter may be used in various hoseline and pipeline configurations.  For example, one pump may support several headers joining a common receipt/issue line.  For tank truck off-loading operations, there may be one pump for several meters placed in lines feeding tactical storage collapsible bags.  Hoses/pipes may contain significant amounts of air at commencement/completion of truck off-loading operations.  

Please refer to the attached documents for detailed information on this request.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is a request for information, there will be no solicitation issued at this time.  The D.C. Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) is an independent entity within the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA). CSOSA and PSA were certified as federal agencies under the Executive Branch in August 2000. PSA has served the Nation’s Capital for more than 30 years. The Agency assists the courts by ensuring that defendants on conditional release return to court for trial and do not engage in criminal activity. PSA has long been a leader in the D.C. criminal justice system, nationally recognized by its innovative supervision programs, use of drug testing, and especially in the use of information technologies and automation.
	PSA maintains a Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory (FTDTL) that is responsible for the toxicological analysis and interpretation of urine samples obtained from defendants that are in pretrial status; probation or parole; or under the order of the court (local or federal) for other reasons such as in cases of abused and neglected children.  The FTDTL currently tests a monthly average of 42,000 (or 2,100 a day) specimens for drugs of abuse with an average of 4.8 drugs tested per specimen. Testing is done at two sites using three Olympus clinical analyzers; two AU2700’s and one AU640e.  The expected turnaround time is 24 hours from receipt of the specimen.  Client information is maintained in a separate information system called PRISM.
     The Pretrial Real-time Information System Manager (PRISM) is an enterprise wide case management system developed to support the Agency’s mission. The main purpose of PRISM is to provide reliable information to improve the timelines and quality of decisions relating to the supervision and treatment of defendants who enter the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia. PRISM was built on standard technologies using ASP, VB, and SQL Server.

The technical POC is: Shane Macey, US Army Research and Development Engineering Center (ARDEC), (973)724-2276.  The technical description of this item is as follows: Fuze, Hand Grenade, M228, NSN: 1330-00-168-5502, DODIC: G878. The M228 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used in conjunction with the M69 Grenade body, as a trainer for the M67 Fragmentation Hand Gre nade. The M228 emits a small puff of smoke when activated. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the grenade body. W hen the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter.  The igniter produces an audible signal and a white smoke charge. For purposes of this survey, anticipated quantities may be in the following ranges: 200k/month for FY07 (2M total) and an option for 320k/month for FY08 (4M total).

<SUBJECT>A -- A - Request for Information (RFI): Design and implementation of a study or studies regarding the potential association of vaccine adverse events and human genetic variation
<DESC>Request for Information: Design and implementation of a study or studies regarding the potential association of vaccine adverse events and human genetic variation .
 
Background:

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of the Director, Office of the Chief Science Officer, Immunization Safety Office (ISO) is soliciting input from qualified scientists to identify the resources, parameters and elements of research protocols designed to identify potential associations between specific human immune response gene polymorphisms and the quality of response to vaccination (i.e. hypo- or hyper-response) or the development of particular adverse events following immunization.

The Human Genome Project has provided an unprecedented opportunity to define the genetic and environmental contributions to health and disease. The scientific progress from this project offers the opportunity to better understand the immunogenetic response to vaccination.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports research related to the basic understanding of how human genetic variation may impact the immunologic response to vaccines and how this individual human genetic variation may affect both the quality of the immune response as well as potential risks for adverse events that may occur following immunization.  The focus of this research program will be to investigate the immunogenetics involved with specific serious adverse events following routine vaccinations or the immunogenetics involved with the failure to mount a normal immune response (i.e. hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination). Identifying individual genetic predisposition that strongly affect the risk for the development of a specific adverse event may allow for the eventual development of evidence-based guidelines for the screening and identification of susceptible children, adolescents and adults who are at risk for vaccine adverse events or vaccine failure.  This information might also be helpful for future vaccine development efforts aimed towards allowing people to be protected against the serious diseases that vaccines are intended to prevent.  

Characteristics of such a study that might maximize its research value may 
include: 

1)	Clear and in-depth delineation of the vaccine adverse event, or the development of hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination.

2)	Collection and storage of biological specimens including DNA, plasma and cells.

3)	Investigation of a broad array of clinical and laboratory information, to include the study of inflammatory pathways and direct antibody and cytolytic T cell responses 

4)	Collaboration with clinical networks covering a sufficiently large number of vaccinated subjects in order to identify sufficient numbers of participants with rare and serious adverse events following immunization, or hypo-response or hyper-response to vaccination.   

5)	Examination of a broad age range of subjects, in order to provide information on rare and serious adverse events, and hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination along a full spectrum of vaccinated people.  

6)	Examination of personal and family history as it pertains to vaccine response or other conditions that might influence vaccine response.

7)	Use of family-based recruitment where appropriate, to increase the power of genetic analyses and control for population stratification

8)	Access to a highly sophisticated data management system and data analysis capabilities


Accordingly, the CDC is soliciting input from the scientific community and the public to guide in developing such a study or studies.

PURPOSE:

This request for information seeks input on approaches to developing one or more studies to perform in-depth clinical investigations along with state-of-the-art genetic methodology that would be capable of studying the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and the development of adverse events following immunization or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination. Input could include suggestions on optimal characteristics of such a study, such as some of the items described above; suggestions on which disease categories (ie rheumatologic; immunologic; neurologic; dermatologic) might be particularly amenable to study, based on current state of knowledge; and, characteristics of existing studies that might lend themselves to inclusion in such efforts.  Respondents are asked to comment on one or more of the issues listed above, but should not feel compelled to address all issues, nor should feel compelled to limit their responses to these categories.

INFORMATION REQUESTED:

1.	If appropriate funding were available to support studies of the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and the development of adverse events following immunization or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination in children, adolescents or adults, please comment on how subjects with rare serious vaccine events or hypo and/or hyper-response to vaccination might best be identified and recruited for study (that is, through registries, medical records review, participant contact) and how often participants might contacted in any manner.
 
2.	Please describe the characteristics of a study that you view as most important to include in any such effort that might be undertaken.

3.	Please suggest the proper comparison group of non-affected individuals that might also be important to study, in order to best understand how genetic variation is linked to disease risk among the affected individuals.

4.	 Please identify the most relevant challenges to the identification of genetic factors influencing the risk of vaccine adverse events, including issues concerning the power to detect genetic effects (such as the incidence of the event following the vaccine and the ability to ascertain individuals with the event of interest), and state of knowledge surrounding relevant gene pathways to study.

5.	 Other information not specifically addressed by the comments above, but considered important and relevant to the development and implementation of a study of the genetic variations that may predispose children, adolescents or adults to certain vaccine adverse events or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccines, and could also be of considerable interest and value.

6.	 How this research can be an expansion of a current project that might be studying other vaccines, serious adverse events, other diseases, or other populations, etc. 

7.	If you were responsible for a study of vaccine adverse events, with the collection of stored DNA, please comment on how likely your study might be able to make its data accessible for use and analysis by other researchers, and the main obstacles for allowing such access.

8.	Please comment on what consent might be needed from your study participants, how it could be obtained, and how likely it might be that roughly 80% or more would consent.

9.	 Please comment on what additional data collection, primarily for risk factors other than those for which the study was established, might be necessary.

10.	 If you are aware of existing cohorts from which eligible study subjects might be identified, please comment on the age, race, and sex distribution of such existing groups of subjects and the proportion of these subjects likely to have stored DNA and other biologic materials such as serum, urine or other tissue available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with PI (Physik Instrumente), LP, of Auburn, Massachusetts, for the acquisition of three (3) LISA Piezo Nanopositioning Stage/Actuator, 12um, Capacitive Direct Metrology, LEMO  part number P-753.11C and one (1) 4-axis Digital Piezo Controller, High-Speed Parallel Port,Cap.Sens., Dig Linearization, Multiaxis Coord, Transform., LEMO Part Number E-710.P4L.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for compatibility.  NIST is using the same piezo and controller set in two other optical systems.  NIST has already invested significant resources developing the control code and computer interface requirements for this piezo stack.  
In addition, NIST requires this piezo stack since NIST can readily use the existing code and interchange the stacks for diagnosis and repair purposes.  This saves considerable amount of testing and development time when something goes wrong or in diagnosing either a hardware problem or a glitch in software. We are using the same piezo set in other instruments. Interchangeability of this piezo set is an absolute requirement. 

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

<DESC>The Materials and Systems Integration Team, Individual Protection Directorate at the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA has a need to identify possible solutions to incorporate the Universal C amouflage (UC) Pattern into standard Woven Nylon webbing.  The government is conducting a market investigation seeking product information, manufacturing capabilities and/or samples of UC Nylon Webbing in the year 2006 to replace the military standard soli d color Woven Nylon webbing.  The webbing shall meet or exceed the performance specifications in MIL-W-4088K, MIL-W-17337F, and A-A-55301 as applicable.  The webbing is intended to be used as a replacement for the current webbing materials which are used o n the Armys Outer Tactical Vest (OTV).  The government will perform all physical testing required to determine the best performance available.  Companies may request testing results regarding only their own materials.  Results from this evaluation may be used to update the current military specification.  When submitting U.S. contracts, offers are cautioned that their products (all materials and manufacturing) must comply with Berry Amendment Restrictions (see DFARS 252.225-7012).  Products shall meet the following critical performance requirements:  (1) Conform to the Infrared and Spectral requirements currently used for the UC pattern on the OTV outer-shell, (2) Conform to current physical performance requirements stated in MIL-W-4088K, MIL-W-17337F, and A-A-55301 as applicable, and (3) The nylon yarn used should be high tenacity, light resistant and heat resistant.  In addition, UC webbing with flame resistant properties, UC webbing made from inherently flame resistance materials as well as printed UC web bing is desired.  Interested firms are requested to submit information on their product within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis.  Information should include, but not limited to, product cost, technical information (e.g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM, AATCC)), certification/compliance, relevant company background/experience, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value of their product(s) and the ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  Companies are also encouraged to submit samples for evaluation.  Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such samples.  The testing results will be controlled and used for governmental purposes only.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Francisco Martinez, Materials and Systems Integration Team, ATTN: AMSRD-NSC-IP-MS, 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5019.  This notice is for market survey o nly.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  No solicitation document exists.

BACKGROUND:  Grey Towers National Historic Site is located in Milford Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania. This area is in northeastern Pennsylvania, about ten miles southwest of the point where Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey join. New York City can be reached by automobile in less than two hours. Grey Towers is situated on a hill overlooking the borough of Milford Pennsylvania and the Delaware River.

Grey Towers National Historic Site is the ancestral home of the Pinchot Family;  most notably, Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest Service and Governor of Pennsylvania for 2 terms.  The site is currently registered as a National Historic Landmark and is under the ownership and operation of the Forest Service.  

The site consists of a main house, referred to as the mansion, several out buildings, landscape structures and features.  The mansion was designed by famed architect, Richard Morris Hunt.  The surrounding landscape features were added at later dates and mostly planned and implemented by Gifford’s wife, Cornelia Bryce Pinchot.  Cornelia’s designs were highly influenced by many renowned landscape architects.

During the better part of the last decade, the Forest Service has been working to implement a Mastery Facilities Site plan for the preservation, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the site.  One of the last major projects to be completed is the preservation and rehabilitation of the historic swimming pool terrace.  The masonry and permanent structural work of the project will be done in partnership with the National Park Service’s Historic Preservation Training Center.  

Once rehabilitated, the historic pool terrace will be used as a main outdoor gathering space to support many programs of the Forest Service.  To use this newly rehabilitated terrace to its full potential, the Forest Service seeks to purchase a temporary, tent-like, structure to protect the area.  

The following are the parameters to use when preparing quotations:

STRUCTURE:

The structure shall provide overhead and side protection from sun, rain and wind.  Floor protection is not requested.  Sides must open for times when only overhead protection is desired.  

HISTORIC LANDSCAPE SENSITIVITY:

The aesthetic characteristics of the selected structure will complement the historic landscape as determined by the Forest Service site experts and other historic landscape experts as needed.  

Permanent adaptations or modifications to this historic terrace will be limited and subject to approval by the Forest Service.  Details of any needed adaptations or modifications shall be submitted with product proposal.

SIZE:  

Maximum size: 40’ width x 80’ length;
Minimum size: 30’ width x 70’ length;
Minimum Eave Height: 7’ from masonry terrace;
Maximum height at any point: 25’ from masonry terrace.

DURABILITY:

Wind Resistance: at least 70 miles per hour for completely assembled structure.

Covering shall be water proof and tear resistant.  

UV breakdown and deterioration of the fabric covering shall be at least 7 years (although longer is preferred).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) monitors humanitarian conditions, assesses disaster impacts, and coordinates ongoing disaster assistance efforts overseas.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  To fill its mandate to respond to disasters around the world on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways.  First, DCHA/OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and two sub-regional offices in the following locations:  San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa; Bridgetown, Barbados; and Kathmandu, Nepal.  Second, in countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it establishes a Program Office within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy.  Third, in the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected country.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  DCHA/OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (OFDA/DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, DARTs and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of OFDA/OPS that provides administration oversight and support for the DCHA/OFDA Regional Offices and for other DCHA/OFDA personnel posted overseas.  This also includes administrative support for DARTs, which often deploy rapidly but can remain in a country for several months or longer.  The administration aspects of personnel and property are essential elements to sustaining programs overseas.  In addition to supporting field operations, OAT is responsible for providing administration oversight and support for RMTs at DCHA/OFDA headquarters.  Further, OAT maintains the primary source for DCHA/OFDA surge capacity staffing, called the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) mechanism, which is a roster of up to 75 part-time Personal Services Contractors (PSCs).

OBJECTIVE

DCHA/OFDA requires an Overseas Administration Team Leader to meet its program objectives and ensure that surge capacity staffing requirements are met.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Overseas Administration Team Leader will:

* Recommend personnel selection, personnel management and organizational structure; ensure that overseas offices are staffed and structured in such a way as to maximize their human resources while remaining flexible to meet the ever-changing demands of DCHA/OFDA;

* Ensure that field activities are carried out in coordination with US Embassies and USAID Missions, and in accordance with USG law and USAID policies and regulations;

* Identify potential interaction and teamwork with existing overseas operations, such as established USAID Missions, with Department of State operations, and with private contractors, to maximize support at the lowest possible management costs;

* Integrate logistics support systems with administrative support mechanisms as well as with personnel systems of USG, PSC and of private sector individuals and  other donors, when appropriate;

* Establish and close all administrative aspects of Regional Offices, Program Offices and DART operations as necessary; design and implement management procedures to facilitate programmatic transition and handover between USAID offices;

* Design innovative management approaches that incorporate more formal relationships with implementing partners, i.e., other USG agencies, Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Organizations (IOs), the United Nations, multinational donors and other private sector entities.

* Supervise all non- U.S. direct hire overseas administrative unit staff in Washington and in the field; 

* Manage the RATS program which provides up to 75 part-time employees to the pool of personnel available to DCHA/OFDA for timely and effective emergency response;

* Serve as the primary interface on administrative matters between DCHA/OFDA and U.S. Embassies and USAID Missions;

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR A COMMERCIAL
ITEM PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334413 or 334510 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a non restricted requirement.  Therefore, any interested vendor may submit a quote.
 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an all-solid-state, diode-pumped, continuous-wave laser producing nominally 532 nm light appropriate for use in high precision 532 nm Raman spectroscopy.
    
All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following:     

NIST desires to purchase an all-solid-state, diode-pumped, continuous-wave laser producing nominally 532 nm light appropriate for use in high precision 532 nm Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, the laser must be appropriate for doubling to 266 nm at a future time for use in UV-Raman spectroscopy. NIST will not procure an external doubling unit at this time. To assure stability and easy use of the laser, the cavity must be of a sealed design, with no user adjustments of the optics. The pump diode must be remote from the laser head, and fiber coupled. The design must allow field replacement of the diode by a knowledgeable end user. Critical to the designed experiments is narrow linewidth, excellent frequency-stability, excellent pointing stability. Detailed specifications are as follows. NIST will consider new or refurbished equipment.

Optical performance

* average output power    	6W
* long term power stability	plus or minus 1percent pk-pk over 2 hours after 15 minute warm-up
* optical noise			less than 0.03 percent rms from 10 Hz to 1 GHz
* mode structure          	TEM00 (Gaussian)
* M-squared				less than or equal to 1.1
* beam diameter			~2.3 mm at 1/e^2 intensity points

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Subj:       JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Ref:       (a) FAR 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition

1.     Pursuant to the requirements of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-3, the justification for limited competition is justified by the following facts and rationale:
2.     MLCA (vpl) has a brand-name requirement to procure Christie & Grey Anti-Vibration Mounts for the USCGC Tornado.     Coast Guard Ship Drawings specify that Christie & Grey Anit-Vibration Mount be installed.     Christie & Grey, Limited, Kent, UK, is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Christie & Grey Anti-Vibration Mount.     The OEM is the only source with the proprietary manufacturing data.     No alternative Anti-Vibration Mount has been approved to be used, nor is suitable.     This requirement does not allow time for a prototype to be developed.
3.     A combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) with the intent to solicit quotes only from Christie & Grey dealers with unique capabilities to satisfy the Coast Guard?s requirement.     Quotes will be solicited only from Christie & Grey dealers as they the only vendors that are able to provide Christie & Grey parts and warranty.

<DESC>The purposes of this amendment are to extend the deadline for submission of quotations in response to this solicitation, amend the period of performance for CLIN 0001, and to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors.

The due date and time for receipt of quotations in response to this RFQ is extended to July 7, 2006 at no later than 3:00:00 p.m. Eastern Time (they must be received at lisa.wells@nist.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nist.gov no later than that date and time.

The period of performance for CLIN 0001 shall be from date of purchase order acceptance through no later than February 28, 2007.

The following are answers to questions submitted by potential offerors:

Questions

Q1) After reviewing the drawing package, there is no hydraulic schematic and hydraulic circuit as part of the package, is this an oversight?  

A1)  Drawings were provided to potential offerors during site visit.  Potential offerors that did not attend the site visit may request a copy of the drawings from frank.davis@nist.gov, with a courtesy copy to stephen.cauffman@nist.gov (this request must be submitted by June 30, 2006 at no later than 3:00:00 p.m.

Q2) Specifications for the 12Mlb UTM upgrade calls for "Load measurement accuracy of plus or minus 1.0% of reading down to 1/250 of the maximum load capacity of the machine".  
 
Presumably the UTM already has a precise load measuring device, since it is currently used for calibrations.   Does the specification mean display load readings with that accuracy, and if so what signals are available from your present load cell(s).

A2) The 12 million pound UTM has an Emery cell which is used to measure the applied load.  The Emery cell has an accuracy of +/- 1.0% down to 1/250 of the maximum capacity of the machine.  There is a +/- 10 V signal that is available from the Emery cell.  The intent of the specification is to read that signal and display load readings with an accuracy of +/- 10 V.

Q3)  Please send information on the accumulators you want to incorporate into the hydraulic system.

A3)  Parker Unit (Piston Accumulator, Model No. A7N369603KTF, Serial No. 407041-01, Capacity 3696CU.IN, Max Operating Pressure 3000 PSI)
 
Q4) Please send information on the existing hydraulic pump (this may be on the schematic in 1. above).   We require flow, pressure, motor horsepower or whatever information you can obtain.

A4)  60 H.P., 900 RPM, Drip-Proof
 
Q5) Please confirm the requirements for the data logging system.   How many inputs, what type, what speed and so on.
A5) Automatically recognize and calibrate transducers (load cells, strain gages, linear variable differential transducers, etc., system of units shall be user selectable (SI, US Customary), data sampling rate shall be at least 40 kHz with 500 Hz synchronous data logging on all channels, minimum of four zero-suppressed, scaled 10 V ouputs (via BNC connection); 25 pin D connector for recorder pulse drive; 4 logic line outputs and 4 logic line inputs to trigger internal and external events, and eight 16-bit resolution A/D conversion channels with a minimum of 50 kHz sampling on a single channel. 
All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

QUESTIONS and ANSWERS

(1)	Functional Requirements:
4pi geometry cannot be met with four detectors but you are willing to accept 4 detectors?

ANSWER:  NIST requires at least 4 detectors (top, bottom, sides). 

(2)	Under Detector Characteristics:
Is the monitor suppose to be able to detect 2 nanocuries of every isotope in the list above it?
You talk about a moderate to low level background of 0.2mR/hr.  200uR/hr is a very high background if you need to detect 2 nanocurie sources.  The lead will need to be very thick and a single individual may not be able to move this system.
Putting this heavy of a system on wheels may be very dangerous. 

ANSWER:  Our typical background is about 20uR/hr. And detection of 2 nanocurie sources can be done with extended count times.

(3)	Some of the isotopes do not seem to have measurable emissions and with a system of this type they would not be detected? (i.e. P-32,CL-36) 
ANSWER:  Testing for conformance to the specification will be done using Cs137.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

<DESC>Request for Proposals No. SN06R0006 and SN06R0007
Questions & Answers
June 27, 2006


Question: 

Regarding the column Section B that requires the offeror to input an “Hourly Travel Rate.” Is this asking for the rate an offeror would charge while traveling, but not actually performing “productive” work, but is essentially on the clock?

Section B requests that an hourly rate be provided for estimated travel costs for each experience category and the methodology for arriving at the travel costs. 

The subcontractor will not be reimbursed for man-hours expended in transit between a trip’s point of origin and destination.”  Yet why is an hourly travel rate asked?

It is requested that a budget be established for travel and that travel costs be invoiced based on actual travel costs incurred based on project requirements.

Answer: 

No – If travel is required, proposers shall provide an average hourly travel rate based upon the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR).
The detailed methodology will ensure that the quotations reflect the appropriate FTR rates and will be used as a basis for evaluation.


Question:

The RFP does not require a single dollar amount for the entire fiscal year, since the offeror does not know how many trips a subcontractor would have to make to NTS.  Is this assumption correct?

Answer:

Yes, the pricing is based upon the burdened hourly rate.  Task orders will be issued for work on an as-needed basis for support services.


Question:

Subsection 5 of Section B states the following: “The Subcontractor will not be reimbursed for man-hours expended in transit between a trip’s point of origin and destination.”  Assuming that “trip” is referring to daily travel from local lodging to the site.


Answer:

This refers to travel to and from the traveler’s home location.  Reimbursement for man-hours (labor costs) will be allowed for one trip to the SNJV location and one trip home.  Intermittent travel home is addressed below. 


Question:

Administrative Technical Services - This item is difficult to resolve with Item #24 of Additional Clauses, which describes the Subcontractor Business Travel Reimbursement clause.  That clause specifies that travel will be reimbursed up to the government per diem rates.  The difficulty lies in estimating how many hours an employee would work in a week and then spread the cost over those hours so that employees are truly reimbursed and SN is not overcharged.  Some of these positions may have periods of time when there is overtime and some would not.
1.	How would hourly travel costs be monitored to ensure they are reimbursed within the guidelines stated in Item #24? 
2.	Would we submit expense reports or simply bill travel based upon the amount of hours worked?
3.	On the Unit Costs form, (Item 2) is the Hourly Travel Rate in addition to the Hourly Pay Rate or would you like to see the travel combined with the hourly pay rate?
4.	How many hours per week should we use to calculate the expenses and how should we bill if the employee works more or less than the 40 hours?
5.	Would we have any guarantee of recovering the actual expenses, up to the guidelines established in Item #24?
6.	Perhaps a weekly travel estimate would be useful instead of an hourly rate?
7.	Will employees be reimbursed for a monthly return trip home, if they are on a long-term assignment?

Answer:

Base hourly rate for travel is on a 40-hour work week priced in the appropriate column
Travel expense reports shall be submitted based upon the actual travel.  
Travel shall not be combined with the burdened hourly rate. Intermittent travel home will be reimbursed at the actual cost of travel or the savings offset by not charging hotel, per diem rental, car, etc. an example is provided below. 


Question:

Regarding the activity report: The RFP indicates that the report should detail the work performed in support of labor hours invoiced.  The bulleted list indicates that a summary of work performed be included.  To what level of detail is sufficient in the activity report?  Is it sufficient to state a few words regarding the type of work performed, i.e. site safety, document review, radiation monitoring/sampling, etc., or is more specific daily details required?  Would this be more of a status report or list of accomplishments?


Answer:

The activity report shall be no more than a couple of paragraphs giving general status of work accomplished, issues, anticipated completion and any other pertinent events. 


Question:

Preferred Background for Radiation Control Technician minimum requirements are 3 years.  The Unit Costs forms in Section B do not have a category for experience under 5 years.  Should an additional category for under 5 years or anyone meeting the minimum requirements in the 5 year category be included?

Answer:

No – The minimum requirements are stated.


Question:

Preferred Background for Site Safety Officer - There is no minimum years of experience required for the SSO (only 6 months at DOE facility).  The Unit Costs minimum range is 5-10 years.  Can we assume that the minimum years experience is 5 years if degreed?  An additional 8 years is stated in lieu of a degree, so we assume the minimum if not degreed is 13 years - Correct? 

Answer:

Yes – to both questions.


Question:

Assumption is that all SSO’s must be current, at our expense, on the following prior to reporting for duty:
1.	OSHA 40 hour HAZWOPER 
2.	8 hour Refresher HAZWOPER 
3.	1910.120 medical clearance 
4.	First Aid/CPR 
5.	Blood borne Pathogens 

Answer:

Yes, all candidates must possess current qualifications.

Question:

Preferred Background for Quality Specialist - No minimum years experience is specified. The Unit Costs minimum range is 5-10 years.  Can we assume that the minimum years experience is 5 years if degreed?  An additional 8 years is stated in lieu of a degree, so we assume the minimum if not degreed is 13 years.  Correct?

Answer:

Yes, to both questions


Question:

Assumption is that the HAZWOPER and 1910.120 requirements for the Quality Specialist are to be current at our expense, as stated above – correct?

Answer:

Correct


Question:

Non-Interference – A request is made that the following paragraph be added to the end of this article:

Notwithstanding the above, Subcontractor shall not be prohibited from submitting a proposal, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor, in response to any follow-on solicitation for services covered by the Department of Energy/SNJV prime contract, even if such solicitation is issued prior to the end of the Department of Energy/SNJV prime contract.  In addition, Subcontractor shall not be precluded from participating as a subcontractor under the Department of Energy Nevada Test Site Management and Operation contract.

Answer:

The requested language change is not accepted.  SNJV’s position is not intended to restrict competition and the subcontractor is not prohibited in anyway from participating in any procurement solicited directly by DOE.  With regard to the subcontractor participating as a subcontractor under the Department of Energy Nevada Test Site Management and Operation contract, the subcontractor may participate in anything that does not fall under the SNJV scope of work.

 
Question:

Other Statements of Offerors - Please clarify as to whether all or part of this information is required to be submitted with the proposal.

Answer:

All of requested information is required to be submitted.  


Question:

If information regarding examples of contracts is needed, do you require a formal project description or is this form sufficient, and are formal references required?

Answer:

The RFP form is sufficient with a listing of references.

Question:

Understanding your requirements to report upon our health and safety data, is it your intent to align that information with your ISMS program or are you suggesting we submit information suggesting we have implemented an ISMS program in the past on other projects.

Answer:

If you do not have an ISMS program, and are awarded a subcontract, you will need to implement the elements of ISMS. 


Question:

We understand that Section B will include the hourly rates that will be used for purposes of invoicing under this contract, and that the labor category information listed in the Statement of Work will be used to help identify individuals to perform the work but will not be used for invoicing purposes.  If this is not correct, please let us know.  

Answer:

The job classification rate is what the subcontractor will be paid for work performed.  The education and experience levels provided allow for commensurate compensation.

 
Question:

Is it possible to add a new labor category to Section B for a scientist with less than two years experience, such as a Jr. Field Technician?  We have several scientists with less than two years experience who would be qualified for and who would contribute positively to this program.  

Answer:

No


Question:

Is it possible to obtain a word file or a fillable pdf version of the reps and certs, the OCI, and other forms for inclusion into our response.  Some of the footers 0006 and 0007 are interchanged for both RFP's and some of the characters on the pdf version are not as intended.

Answer:

No


Question:

The RFP lists several different experience Categories.  Can a company submitting hourly rates for selected position only?  For example, could we submit rates for QA specialist and Radiation Control Technicians only?

Answer:

Yes, it is your option to provide a quotation for selected categories only.


Question:

In the event a bidder does not have an established Employee Modification Rate (EMR), what information is acceptable to submit in lieu of an established EMR?

Answer:

SNJV cannot direct you in your accounting practices; however, your quotation needs to be a burdened rate.

 
Question:

The RFP states the work under the contract will typically be of short duration.  Can you indicate more specifically what “short duration” means? Does it mean one week, two weeks, one month or three months?

Answer:

At this time, we do not know specifically what amount of time will be required. Work will be on a task order basis at the time it is required.  Based on demand some categories may or may not be used.


Question:

At what frequency will individuals be allowed to travel home with travel expenses paid if a project is more than one week?

Answer:  

Intermittent travel home can be at any frequency however, intermittent travel home will only be reimbursed at the actual cost of travel or the savings offset resulting from not charging hotel, per diem and rental, car, whichever is lower.  An example is provided below (for the purposes of calculation we have made the following assumptions – The traveler will depart for home on Friday and return on Monday.  The Government rate for hotel $112 - the example does not address taxes, per diem $64, rental car $38.) The traveler’s labor costs for travel time on intermittent trips home is at the expense of the subcontractor and will not be reimbursed. Reimbursement for man-hours (labor costs) will be allowed for one trip to the SNJV location at the start of the requirement and one trip home at the conclusion of the task.

Questions & Answers
June 27, 2006

Question: 

Regarding the column Section B that requires the offeror to input an “Hourly Travel Rate.” Is this asking for the rate an offeror would charge while traveling, but not actually performing “productive” work, but is essentially on the clock?

Section B requests that an hourly rate be provided for estimated travel costs for each experience category and the methodology for arriving at the travel costs. 

The subcontractor will not be reimbursed for man-hours expended in transit between a trip’s point of origin and destination.”  Yet why is an hourly travel rate asked?

It is requested that a budget be established for travel and that travel costs be invoiced based on actual travel costs incurred based on project requirements.

Answer: 

No – If travel is required, proposers shall provide an average hourly travel rate based upon the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR).
The detailed methodology will ensure that the quotations reflect the appropriate FTR rates and will be used as a basis for evaluation.


Question:

The RFP does not require a single dollar amount for the entire fiscal year, since the offeror does not know how many trips a subcontractor would have to make to NTS.  Is this assumption correct?

Answer:

Yes, the pricing is based upon the burdened hourly rate.  Task orders will be issued for work on an as-needed basis for support services.

Question:

Subsection 5 of Section B states the following: “The Subcontractor will not be reimbursed for man-hours expended in transit between a trip’s point of origin and destination.”  Assuming that “trip” is referring to daily travel from local lodging to the site.


Answer:

This refers to travel to and from the traveler’s home location.  Reimbursement for man-hours (labor costs) will be allowed for one trip to the SNJV location and one trip home.  Intermittent travel home is addressed below. 


Question:

Administrative Technical Services - This item is difficult to resolve with Item #24 of Additional Clauses, which describes the Subcontractor Business Travel Reimbursement clause.  That clause specifies that travel will be reimbursed up to the government per diem rates.  The difficulty lies in estimating how many hours an employee would work in a week and then spread the cost over those hours so that employees are truly reimbursed and SN is not overcharged.  Some of these positions may have periods of time when there is overtime and some would not.
1.	How would hourly travel costs be monitored to ensure they are reimbursed within the guidelines stated in Item #24? 
2.	Would we submit expense reports or simply bill travel based upon the amount of hours worked?
3.	On the Unit Costs form, (Item 2) is the Hourly Travel Rate in addition to the Hourly Pay Rate or would you like to see the travel combined with the hourly pay rate?
4.	How many hours per week should we use to calculate the expenses and how should we bill if the employee works more or less than the 40 hours?
5.	Would we have any guarantee of recovering the actual expenses, up to the guidelines established in Item #24?
6.	Perhaps a weekly travel estimate would be useful instead of an hourly rate?
7.	Will employees be reimbursed for a monthly return trip home, if they are on a long-term assignment?

Answer:

Base hourly rate for travel is on a 40-hour work week priced in the appropriate column
Travel expense reports shall be submitted based upon the actual travel.  
Travel shall not be combined with the burdened hourly rate. Intermittent travel home will be reimbursed at the actual cost of travel or the savings offset by not charging hotel, per diem rental, car, etc. an example is provided below. 


Question:

Regarding the activity report: The RFP indicates that the report should detail the work performed in support of labor hours invoiced.  The bulleted list indicates that a summary of work performed be included.  To what level of detail is sufficient in the activity report?  Is it sufficient to state a few words regarding the type of work performed, i.e. site safety, document review, radiation monitoring/sampling, etc., or is more specific daily details required?  Would this be more of a status report or list of accomplishments?


Answer:

The activity report shall be no more than a couple of paragraphs giving general status of work accomplished, issues, anticipated completion and any other pertinent events. 


Question:

Preferred Background for Radiation Control Technician minimum requirements are 3 years.  The Unit Costs forms in Section B do not have a category for experience under 5 years.  Should an additional category for under 5 years or anyone meeting the minimum requirements in the 5 year category be included?

Answer:

No – The minimum requirements are stated.


Question:

Preferred Background for Site Safety Officer - There is no minimum years of experience required for the SSO (only 6 months at DOE facility).  The Unit Costs minimum range is 5-10 years.  Can we assume that the minimum years experience is 5 years if degreed?  An additional 8 years is stated in lieu of a degree, so we assume the minimum if not degreed is 13 years - Correct? 

Answer:

Yes – to both questions.


Question:

Assumption is that all SSO’s must be current, at our expense, on the following prior to reporting for duty:
1.	OSHA 40 hour HAZWOPER 
2.	8 hour Refresher HAZWOPER 
3.	1910.120 medical clearance 
4.	First Aid/CPR 
5.	Blood borne Pathogens 

Answer:

Yes, all candidates must possess current qualifications.


Question:

Preferred Background for Quality Specialist - No minimum years experience is specified. The Unit Costs minimum range is 5-10 years.  Can we assume that the minimum years experience is 5 years if degreed?  An additional 8 years is stated in lieu of a degree, so we assume the minimum if not degreed is 13 years.  Correct?

Answer:

Yes, to both questions


Question:

Assumption is that the HAZWOPER and 1910.120 requirements for the Quality Specialist are to be current at our expense, as stated above – correct?

Answer:

Correct


Question:

Non-Interference – A request is made that the following paragraph be added to the end of this article:

Notwithstanding the above, Subcontractor shall not be prohibited from submitting a proposal, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor, in response to any follow-on solicitation for services covered by the Department of Energy/SNJV prime contract, even if such solicitation is issued prior to the end of the Department of Energy/SNJV prime contract.  In addition, Subcontractor shall not be precluded from participating as a subcontractor under the Department of Energy Nevada Test Site Management and Operation contract.

Answer:

The requested language change is not accepted.  SNJV’s position is not intended to restrict competition and the subcontractor is not prohibited in anyway from participating in any procurement solicited directly by DOE.  With regard to the subcontractor participating as a subcontractor under the Department of Energy Nevada Test Site Management and Operation contract, the subcontractor may participate in anything that does not fall under the SNJV scope of work.


 
Question:

Other Statements of Offerors - Please clarify as to whether all or part of this information is required to be submitted with the proposal.

Answer:

All of requested information is required to be submitted.  


Question:

If information regarding examples of contracts is needed, do you require a formal project description or is this form sufficient, and are formal references required?

Answer:

The RFP form is sufficient with a listing of references.


Question:

Understanding your requirements to report upon our health and safety data, is it your intent to align that information with your ISMS program or are you suggesting we submit information suggesting we have implemented an ISMS program in the past on other projects.

Answer:

If you do not have an ISMS program, and are awarded a subcontract, you will need to implement the elements of ISMS. 


Question:

We understand that Section B will include the hourly rates that will be used for purposes of invoicing under this contract, and that the labor category information listed in the Statement of Work will be used to help identify individuals to perform the work but will not be used for invoicing purposes.  If this is not correct, please let us know.  

Answer:

The job classification rate is what the subcontractor will be paid for work performed.  The education and experience levels provided allow for commensurate compensation.


Question:

Is it possible to add a new labor category to Section B for a scientist with less than two years experience, such as a Jr. Field Technician?  We have several scientists with less than two years experience who would be qualified for and who would contribute positively to this program.  

Answer:

No


Question:

Is it possible to obtain a word file or a fillable pdf version of the reps and certs, the OCI, and other forms for inclusion into our response.  Some of the footers 0006 and 0007 are interchanged for both RFP's and some of the characters on the pdf version are not as intended.

Answer:

No


Question:

The RFP lists several different experience Categories.  Can a company submitting hourly rates for selected position only?  For example, could we submit rates for QA specialist and Radiation Control Technicians only?

Answer:

Yes, it is your option to provide a quotation for selected categories only.


Question:

In the event a bidder does not have an established Employee Modification Rate (EMR), what information is acceptable to submit in lieu of an established EMR?

Answer:

SNJV cannot direct you in your accounting practices; however, your quotation needs to be a burdened rate.

 
Question:

The RFP states the work under the contract will typically be of short duration.  Can you indicate more specifically what “short duration” means? Does it mean one week, two weeks, one month or three months?

Answer:

At this time, we do not know specifically what amount of time will be required. Work will be on a task order basis at the time it is required.  Based on demand some categories may or may not be used.


Question:

At what frequency will individuals be allowed to travel home with travel expenses paid if a project is more than one week?

Answer:  

Intermittent travel home can be at any frequency however, intermittent travel home will only be reimbursed at the actual cost of travel or the savings offset resulting from not charging hotel, per diem and rental, car, whichever is lower.  An example is provided below (for the purposes of calculation we have made the following assumptions – The traveler will depart for home on Friday and return on Monday.  The Government rate for hotel $112 - the example does not address taxes, per diem $64, rental car $38.) The traveler’s labor costs for travel time on intermittent trips home is at the expense of the subcontractor and will not be reimbursed. Reimbursement for man-hours (labor costs) will be allowed for one trip to the SNJV location at the start of the requirement and one trip home at the conclusion of the task.

3.	What is the percentage of sonic vs. auger/direct push, ATV drilling methods?
90% ROTOSONIC

4.	Is there any training in excess of OSHA standard 1910.120 relative to potential radioactive exposure?
10CFR 835 RAD WORKER II WITH AN NTS (SITE-SPECIFIC) MODULE IS ADEQUATE. 

5.	Does a certified welder need to be onsite or available at the contractor facility?
NO

6.	Is the reference to OSHA 1910.126 a typographical error and if not, how does it apply to this scope of work?
IT SHOULD READ 1910.120

7.	What permits are required?
NO PERMITS ARE REQUIRED 

8.	If so, is the contractor responsible for all permit fees?
NOT APPLICABLE 

9.	What are the referenced NRC licenses or certifications required?
NO NRC REQUIREMENTS - THIS WAS LISTED IN ERROR 

10.	What are the primary potential contaminants of concern?
PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS (DIESEL OR GASOLINE) AND CONSTITUENTS. 

11.	The SOW implies in the text that the Drilling Supervisor/Driller is one person.  Section B – Pricing Schedule/Proposal Form lists a separate Drilling Supervisor, Driller, Helpers (2).  Should one rate be supplied for the Drilling Supervisor/Driller as part of a 3-man crew or is it intended to have a 4-man crew?
3-MAN CREW - LIST EACH JOB CLASSIFICATION WITH SPECIFIC RATE 

12.	Are 6 samplers required?
YES AS PER THE SOW  

13.	 Is the 10CFR 835 Rad Worker II training provided at the NTS site or is this the responsibility of the subcontractor to independently obtain?  What is the length of the required or site specific training?
RAD WORKER II TRAINING IS PROVIDED AT  NTS.  SNJV WILL HELP WITH ENROLLMEN IN REQUIRED CLASSES.  THE SUBCONTRACTOR WILL NEED TO INDPENDENTLY OBTAIN/MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTATION.  SOME JOBS DO NOT REQEUIRE RAD WORKER II CERTIFICATION.  THIS IS A JOB-DEPENDENT REQUIREMENT AND WILL BE LISTED IN SITE SPECIFIC SOWS.  THE REQUIRED TRAINING, INCLUDING SITE SPECIFIC, IS 2-DAYS IN DURATION. 

14.	It appears from the accelerated bid process and the short duration of the initial phase of the contract encompassing August and September that there may be priority projects during that time frame or projects that cannot be performed by others.  What would be the expected task order size and type of drilling required during this 2-month period?  Would the Rad Worker II training be required for task orders performed during this time?
ROTOSONIC DRILLING AND THIS WILL REQUIRE RAD WORKER II.  DUE TO THE SHORT NOTICE, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SNJV WILL HAVE TO MAKE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO HOLD THE TRAINING FOR THE CREW. – JOB WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 80 TO 100 HOURS.


Reference SNJV RFP Letter:

Answer:  For the regular flu shots, i.e. 2004 = 1600, 2003 = 1200, 2002 = 1000 &amp; for 2005 there was a flu shot shortage), the contractor will cover the cost; but for extreme cases where the number exceeds the average, Government will cover the cost under the AD HOC Clin What is the expectation for EAP services:  face-to-face counseling sessions  Answer: 5-6 sessions per issue Approximately 10 employees per month There is a backup  1-800 telephone number Are there DVA established/required protocols, e.g. treadmills, hearing examinations?  If so what are they?  Answer:  No except for food service handlers, motor vehicle operators, and drug testing Are there any industrial operations?  If so how many employees are engaged in these type operations? Answer:  no What is the medical records media--all paper or electronic?  If electronic, is it government owned or contractor owned software?  Answer:  The medical records are hard copies How is biohazardous waste currently handled? Answer:  The incumbent has an arrangement with a biohazard company to collect the waste/hazardous materials Is the vendor required to pay for X-rays  or will this be considered a pass through expense within the AD HOC Clin?  If this is not a pass through expense, approximately how many x-rays are taken in any given year?-  Answer:  NO, X-RAYS are not required Are lab tests required as part of the physical examination?  If so, which lab tests are required and how many per year Answer:  	a.  Lab tests are required    b. Complete chemistries, chem. 20, CBC (complete blood count with differential), urinalysis, glaucoma screening and ekg,   c.  On an average 20 test sets per month. Will these be considered a pass through expense and billed on the AD HOC Clin?  Answer:  No, it is part of the standard service There was no equipment list provided.  Was this inadvertently not supplied or is the vendor to consider equipment purchases to be a pass through expense to be billed under the ad hoc clin? Answer:  Equipment is provided in support of required services (the listing is attached). The Wage Determination Labor Category for the Lead Nurse provides for a wage that is higher than the prevailing market wages for the associated responsibilities?  It has been our experience that Lead Nurse salaries in the DC Metro area are several dollars per hour less.  Will this be reconsidered or shall we quote the wage minimum per the Service Contract Act? Answer: The DOL wage determination presents the mandatory minimums.  Is the vendor to assume that all fitness center costs, except those mentioned under Contractor Furnished Property/Materials, are to be paid for with membership dues?  In other words, when the vendor collects the dues, do they keep the dues to fund the fitness center costs?  What is to be done with funds that are in excess of costs plus reasonable fees (if there are any excess funds)? Answer:  The DVA provides the facility, electricity, equipment and water.  The vendor is to manage the facility and any excess in fees (minus salaries and supplies) would be considered profit for the vendor Is the vendor to set up the drug  testing program?   Answer:  No, it is already established. Are they to absorb the costs or is this to be billed under the ad hoc clin?  If not, approximately how many drug tests are provided in any given year? Answer:  The vendor is only providing the supervised extraction and transportation of the sample.  And there are approximately 2-4 employees a month Is the vendor required to sign and include the "Business Associate Agreement" as provided in the RFP?  Answer:  It must be signed prior to award.  It is not necessary to include it in the proposal as the vendor may require adjustments Is FAR 52.212-3 the only FAR that needs to be completed and submitted with our proposal (or completed on line at orca.bpn.org)? Answer:  It is the representations and certifications for the award.   Does the Scope of Work require that the Contractor manages one fitness center located at 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, (VA Central Office) and employees/contractors from the three other locations use the one workout facility? Thus, providing fitness services for the roughly 4500 employees? Answer:  Historically, it is only 350 -450 members.  It may be possible to greatly improve the membership but not to the scope of the total population - the facility is too small.   Each of the four locations would have an on-site wellness center in which the Contractor would also manage? Answer:  Yes, there is a wellness center (clinic) in each of the locations Is the Past Performance section now the following? The offeror shall identify three (3) contracts /task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years. Relevant is defined as work similar in type, complexity and , magnitude of the work described in this Statement of Objectives.  The Offeror is requested to provide the Government a telephone number, email address, and fax number of the three contractors where the Government can send out the Past Performance Questionnaire.  This information should be submitted with the proposals. Answer:  Yes, it is now the requirement for submission. List of Site Visit Attendees Whole Health Management Inc.
