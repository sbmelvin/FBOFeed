<CONTACT>Linwood Gillette, 202-493-4753
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to LUCIAD to provide services necessary to develop a prototype for a computer-aided design (CAD)-based editor for special use airspaces (SUAs).  The prototype should be web-deployable, developed as a Java applet or Java Web Start application with full geographic information system (GIS) capabilities in a rich user interface (UI).  The prototype should be built by current AIM employees and contractors with software, training and support procured under this contract. The purpose of this project is to procure Luciad's off-the-shelf software which can satisfy much of the requirements for the SUA prototype at the outset.  Further, AIM will require training on the development of the software as well as follow-up support as AIM develops the prototype.   The software and application programming interface (API) procured under this contract must meet the following requirements: ýýý	AIXM capable - the software must be able to read, write and display AIXM5 data with little to no additional custom data parsing beyond schema definitions.  ýýý	Oracle Spatial capable - the software must be able to read and display 4-D Oracle Spatial data. ýýý	CAD editing - the software must provide functionality for geodetic 2-D editing capabilities that can be implemented through the existing API. ýýý	GIS-enabled - the software must provide GIS capabilities to represent vector shapes and rasters using different geodetic datum and projections as well as perform standard computations on those shapes. ýýý	Aeronautical symbology - the ability to display aeronautical symbology using the API ýýý	100% Pure Java - the API provided should be a Java API that allows for use of all Java capabilities, such as XML parsing, web service connectivity, and so forth. ýýý	Deployable as Applet or Web Start Application - rather than creating a client-side application which requires the user to install a separate program onto their own computers ýýý	Data source agnostic - the ability to serve maps and other geodetic data from many data sources The training and software provided under this contract will directly contribute to the development of a prototype SUA Editor.  This web applet will serve as proof of concept for a full-featured SUA Editor.  The editor will interface with SWIM systems, including a static repository managed by NAS/R, as well as external systems used in the approval process. The primary goal of the SUA project is to allow for the addition of data to the static SUA and ATCAA repository as well as the communication of any status changes to those airspaces to the operational systems.  All of this is to be done with web services.  The supporting web sites and services are out of the scope of this proposed contract. A single source contract for one year period of performance in the amount of $150,000 is being pursued. No future requirement is planned. Though there are APIs which satisfy some of these requirements, none except Luciad satisfy them all.  Further, Luciad is a mature company with a significant user base, especially in Europe, with a full-featured API.  Through testimonials, the API appears to be one with which it relatively easy to develop user interfaces.   The research done as to the capabilities of other companies for the work necessary found that, though there are a number of GIS options available, there are very few full suites of GIS software available and none meet all the specific needs of AIM for this project except Luciad. It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the FAA to acquire this full GIS suite. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firms capability and experience and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Linwood Gillette, Contracting Officer by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, March 18, 2008.

<DESC>The goal of this DHS Science & Technology research program is to develop algorithms and/or analytical tools that will assist investigators of bioterrorism events by providing precision and statistical power to inferences concerning the degree of relatedness among organisms or samples used in a bioterrorist event.  The focus of this effort will be on research in the areas microbial ecology, population dynamics, host-pathogen interaction. genetic stability, statistical inference, and match criteria for the following select agents:  Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Clostridium botulinum, Francisella tularensis, Brucella sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei.  The objectives include:

1.  Improving our understanding of the population genetics of these pathogens to include research on genome stability, host preferences and interactions, genetic mobility of virulence factors, polymorphic sites, mutational hot spots, geographical distribution, microbial ecology, pathogen lifecycles, natural reservoirs, effects of host - pathogen interaction, etc.
2.  Improving methods for determining rates of mutation and recombination of the pathogen genomes and the identification of adaptive mutations that can have forensic utility
3.  Establishing match criteria for discriminating "difference" or "sameness" in sample comparisons. Define the parameters for inclusion or exclusion in the context of a known sample and questioned sample.  This must be backed by statistical parameters for acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis
4.  Developing  efficient, economical, and statistically rigorous sampling strategies to acquire spatially referenced genetic information on reservoirs of these pathogens
5.  Developing bioinformatics-based analytical tools for supporting hypotheses testing regarding pathogen origin that go beyond current phylogeny-based inferential methods and can meet forensic (legal) admissibility requirements of relevance and reliability.

<ARCHDATE>03112009
<CONTACT>Jim Knesel 301-744-6885 Jim Knesel 301-744-6885
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to advance and mature existing state-of-the-art autonomous robotic capabilities for the purpose of assessing performance limitations in relevant environments subject to current EOD tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to identify advanced robotic technology developments that may ultimately be integrated into currently fielded and/or future EOD Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs).  BACKGROUND:  The use of UGVs as a primary response tool for the EOD operator has increased dramatically in ongoing operations in OIF and OEF.  The current generation of fielded UGVs is teleoperated, which places a large workload on the operator when performing manipulation and navigation related tasks in complex environments.  The development and integration of technology to enable increased levels of autonomy in EOD UGVs will improve the ability of the operator t!  o perform common tasks such as navigation and manipulation.  These advances will allow more of the UGV operator?s attention to be placed on EOD procedure selection, mission execution, and on monitoring the surrounding environment.  The integration of autonomous capabilities will simplify tedious tasks currently performed by robot operators, decreasing their overall operational workload, and potentially decreasing their overall time-on-target.  In addition, it has the potential to enable to operator to perform more complex tasks remotely than is currently possible with existing systems.  TECHNOLOGY MATURATION:  Interested firms are requested to submit white papers/full proposals that define an effort to develop and integrate their advanced autonomous capabilities onto an EOD class UGV.  These proposed projects may include the performance of limited development to mature the existing capability such that a clean and unobtrusive integration onto an EOD class UGV is possible.  !  Following the maturation and integration processes, the integrated EOD  class UGV will undergo testing at NAVEODTECHDIV, Indian Head, MD in order to assess the technology readiness level of the specific autonomous capability proposed.  EOD UGV enhancements are sought in the following two technology areas:  1. MANIPULATION - Current EOD UGV manipulators have limited autonomous capability, generally requiring the operator to independently control the manipulator degrees of freedom in order to control the position and velocity of the end-effector.  Capabilities that allow the manipulator end-effector to be controlled directly in 3-D space using resolved motion have been developed, but these approaches still require a high level of user feedback and input.  Autonomous manipulation capabilities are desired that enable straightforward and efficient manipulation strategies.  The ability to rapidly and accurately approach manipulation targets has been identified as an essential characteristic of future EOD manipulation control schemes.  Capabilities ar!  e desired that allow the manipulator to be moved autonomously; requiring only high level input and supervision from the operator.  Some of the common tasks typically performed using robotic manipulators are:  picking up and placing EOD tools and ordnance, opening doors, digging, using hand-tools and power tools (drills, saws, etc.).  2. NAVIGATION - Fielded EOD UGVs are tele-operated and have no autonomous navigation capabilities.  The operator must manually drive the robot both down range to the mission area and then back to the command post when the mission has concluded.  Capabilities are desired that will allow the UGV to navigate autonomously while allowing the operator to closely monitor the video and other sensor data sent from the vehicle.   Typically the EOD operator uses the robot to conduct reconnaissance for secondary items of interest while driving it downrange to perform the primary mission.   Autonomous capabilities that allow the EOD operator to rapidly inve!  stigate multiple items of interest near the robot using vehicle motion  in combination with the control of cameras and other vehicle sensors is desired.   WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not be considered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to five pages in length and may address either or both of the technology areas defined above.  The white paper shall consist of three primary areas: Technical, Management, and Cost.

<RESPDATE>040908
<ARCHDATE>03112009
<CONTACT>Jim Knesel 301-744-6886
<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to improve operator situational awareness (SA) when they are using the Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) EOD Unmanned Ground Vehicles.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to identify advanced visualization sensors and information display technologies and techniques to enhance the robot operator?s awareness of the robotic vehicle?s environment. These technologies will be used to improve the ability of the operator to perform remote tasks in complex environments.  If successful, these technologies will be considered for potential integration with currently fielded MTRS Mk 1 and MTRS Mk 2 EOD Robotic systems.  BACKGROUND:  The use of UGVs as a primary response tool in EOD operations has increased dramatically in recent years.  The MTRS Mk 1 (MTRS PackBot EOD) and MTRS Mk 2 (MTRS Talon) UGVs rely on video feedback from multiple cameras displayed on the Operator Control Unit (!  OCU) as the primary means of providing SA to the operator.  These cameras provide limited information in terms of depth perception and the location of objects within the target environment relative to the robotic vehicle.  There is a need to incorporate advanced visualization technologies with the MTRS UGVs to improve the ability of the operator to conduct critical mission tasks including inspection, surveillance, manipulation, and navigation in complex environments.   TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION:  Interested firms are requested to submit white papers/full proposals that define the effort to fully integrate their advanced visualization capabilities with either the MTRS Mk 1 or MTRS Mk 2 robots.  These proposed projects may include technology development to optimize and mature existing technologies to enable low-risk transition to the MTRS.  It is expected that along with the final, field-ready prototype(s), a full technical data package will be delivered, including engineering drawings and hardware specifications, providing for low-risk modification of the fielded MTRS configuration(s).  Throughout the effort, monthly status updates and interim design reviews will be required to address any technical issues and update the overall progress of the effort.  Following the development and integration processes, a modified MTRS will be delivered for testing at NAVEODTECHDIV, Indian Head, MD in order to evaluate the improvements to the!   system under several mission-based test scenarios.  To provide additional context, the following tasks are typical of an EOD robotic mission.  EOD MISSION:  MTRS visualization enhancements are required that will improve any of the tasks identified in the following EOD mission profile: (a) Unload UGV from transport vehicle; (b) Perform surveillance of the path to the target while driving the UGV down range to the target location; (c) Perform reconnaissance of  target and target area; (d) Use of manipulator to perform render-safe operations (e.g. place or aim tools and sensors, pick-up ordnance, clear debris and dirt); (e) Verification of success of EOD procedure and additional reconnaissance; (f) Drive robot back to command post; (g) Load UGV into transport vehicle.  WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the Offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not be c!  onsidered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to  five pages and shall consist of three primary areas: Technical, Management, and Cost.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East Information Technology/Information Management (IT/IM) Department, located at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina, has a requirement for the replacement of an Enterprise Data Storage System/Storage Area Network (SAN). This effort will include the provision of all hardware and software required for replacement of the system, installation of the system, and engineering and maintenance support with options for extended maintenance and engineering support.  Offerors may propose other than SAN technology, such as Network Attached Storage (NAS), as long as the proposed system meets the minimum performance requirements of the Performance Work Statement.  

A Sources Sought relating to this requirement was posted at FedBizOpps on 12 January 2007 under Reference No. N6592307PR0014.  

The FRC East IT/IM Department operates an enterprise class data center which provides information processing services for the facility. Currently, FRC East is utilizing a Hewlett-Packard XP-512 Storage Area Network which provides approximately 32 terabytes of raw storage space and 32 gigabytes of cache. The current Storage Area Network (SAN) supports a high-availability cluster that houses corporate databases and applications which support production throughout the facility. The high-availability cluster is comprised of Hewlett-Packard RP-8400 mid-range servers running the HP-UX operating system.  These servers are connected to the SAN via a Fiber Channel fabric. Clustering is achieved through the use of Veritas Cluster Server configured to provide an active-passive failover environment. 

The FRC East data center environment also includes Intel-based servers (primarily Dell) that run the Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Red Hat Linux and Solaris operating systems. It also includes SPARC-based servers that run the Solaris operating system. In total, there are approximately 175 servers. With the exception of the HP-UX machines described above, all of these systems currently utilize internal or direct-attached external disk arrays for data storage. 

File system management for the HP-UX cluster is provided via the Veritas File System, and data is backed up utilizing Hewlett-Packard Linear Tape Open (LTO) tape drives and Veritas Net Backup software. Although a number of applications are hosted on the cluster, its primary function is to host the Oracle databases that function as an enterprise data repository. The bulk of input /output (I/O) performed between the cluster and the SAN is in support of database transactions and consequently the system is configured and tuned to optimize database access. The SAN has extensive self-monitoring, diagnostic and prognostic capabilities to allow it to achieve the availability and reliability that FRC East requires.

This requirement is being issued allowing for full and open competition.

Delivery, installation, testing, acceptance, and training will be at FRC East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC 28533.  
  
Installation of the system shall be completed within sixty (60) calendar days from date of contract award.       

The complete solicitation will be released on or about 25 March 2008 and will be posted at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) home page at: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ with proposals due approximately thirty (30) days thereafter.     

Interested parties should continue to monitor both the FBO and NAVAIR web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.  

For information regarding this requirement, contact Sherry Kelly via e-mail at sherry.l.kelly@navy.mil .

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, Florida is soliciting competitive quotes from qualified small businesses to purchase three (3) battery chargers that can meet the needs of the main propulsion and electronics battery for the AN/ASQ 235 (AMNS) Exercise Neutralizer, and be suitable for fleet use.  This battery charger will be required to charge up to four destructors at one time and will need a simple and intuitive control panel for ease of operation.  The case which the battery charger is located in should be water tight when closed and the internal packaging of the battery charger should allow it to withstand ship board shock loads without damaging the electronics.  A total of three battery chargers will be needed to support the various testing, and training agendas between the two programs.  Charging the destructor battery requires application of 12 volts DC to a relay within the destructor.  The relay draws approximately o!  ne ampere of current.  The relay closes the circuit connecting the positive lead from the destructor battery to the connector on the exterior of the destructor.  The relay is energized by a pin within the same 4-pin connector on the destructor hull used to charge the battery.  The current scenario is to apply the 12 volt, DC signal from a separate power supply.  The required delivery date will be within 120 days after contract award.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination to NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida 32407.   This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 35999, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The solicitation closing date is 26 March 2008.  The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Registr!  ation may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.c cr.gov/ .  A paper registration form may be obtained from the Department of Defense Electronic Commerce Information center at  1-888-227-2423.

Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NESDIS), Acquisition Division, SSMC3, Room 10100/OFA64 1315 East West Highway, 10th Floor, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910

Description

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Research & Applications Division intends to award a requirement on a sole source basis with George Mason University. George Mason University to obtain Consistent Land Surface Temperature from GOES Satellites.

The services required by Climate Research & Applications Division are available from only one responsible source, George Mason University. 

1.0	Introduction

Information on land surface temperature (LST) is important for understanding climate change, modeling the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, and is a prime candidate parameter for Numerical Weather Prediction assimilation models. Current GOES LST at NOAA NESDIS is an intermediate product derived from sounder data which is poor in resolution and unknown accuracy. High resolution GOES LSTs with better accuracy are required from users, like the NCEP Weather forecast and data assimilation model (Ken Mitchell). In addition, the GOES LSTs derived from GOES-East and GOES-West may be mission goals in Climate, and Weather and water, a proposal for developing consistent LST from GOES satellites was submitted and approved by GOES Improved Measurements and Product Assurance Plan (GIMPAP). This statement of work (SOW) defines the tasks and the approved Project.

2.0	Statement of Work

1)	Split-window LST Algorithm(s) and coefficients will be developed/adapted and generated. The algorithms are applicable for the infrared bands of GOES Imagers including GOES-8, GOES-10, and GOES-11 (Yu et al., 2007). Due to the lack of split window on the GOES M-Q, Sun and Pinker (2004) developed a new LST algorithm by using the middle infrared channel or water vapor information, this methodology will be adapted to GOES 12 and GOES-13, with explicit use of emissivity information as is used for the split window technique. 

2)	MODTRAN radiative transfer model will be used to generate simulation dataset. Algorithms will be optimized from comparing the simulation results of different algorithms. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to further optimize and characterize the new LST algorithm. 

3)	The algorithms will be performed for inter-comparison to LSTs derived from different GOES Imagers, for a final consistent LST algorithm for GOES imagers. The GOES LST?s will be evaluated against ground measurements (e.g., SURFRAD/CRN data), and MODIS LST products. MSG/SEVIRI data will also be used for the algorithm evaluation. 

3.0	Suggest Staffing

The level of effort required is 0.5 FTE for 12 months. Expertise in satellite land surface temperature retrieval researches is desired. 

4.0	Deliverables

Preliminary design review (April 2008)
Simulation database for development and evaluation (Sept 2008)
Documentation for algorithm development and implementation (DEC 2008)
Documentation for GOES-E SOES-W LST Difference Analysis (Jan 2009)
Documentation for ground evaluation results (March 2009)

Interested parties who believe that they can meet the Government?s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response; all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstration the ability to meet the above requirements. In your response, you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written response must be received no later than fifteen days after publication of this synopsis. The solicitation for this requirement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated. The Period of Performance for this task is from date of award through March 31, 2009. Responses may be emailed to Jay.Parsick@noaa.gov . Reference Solicitation No. NEEA0000-8-27518 in your response.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), Threat and Consequence Assessment Division (TCAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, to enhance the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) software tool by incorporating water utility with Public Health Data for the Water Security (WS)/Contamination Warning System (CWS). This project aims to expand and implement the conceptual design of the ESSENCE water module which shall include: (1) the addition of at least two additional health effect nodes; (2) extend the water utility detection framework to include customer complaint data; (3) validate water quality node through expansion to at least two other water utilities; and (4) pursue the use of the water module in other ESSENCE jurisdictions. The tasks to be performed under the Base Period of the Performance Work Statement includes: (1) Add an additional water utility to the ESSENCE WS-CWS public health initiative; (2) Enhance the ESSENCE WS-CWS; (3) Provide a Data and Telecommunication Infrastructure for Water Utilities and their Public Health Partners and; (4) Evaluate the Project. Two options are also included in the procurement.  Option 1 includes the following tasks: (1) Add an additional water utility to the ESSENCE WS-CWS public health initiative; (2) Enhance the ESSENCE WS-CWS; (3) Provide a Data and Telecommunication Infrastructure for Water Utilities and their Public Health Partners and; (4) Evaluate the Project.  Option 2 includes the following tasks: (1) Work with pilot utilities and public health departments for full functionality and describe a general system architecture for an ESSENCE WS-CWS; (2) Validate the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN's); and (3) Evaluate the Project.   EPA source research indicates that JHU APL is uniquely qualified to enhance the ESSENCE software tool based on the fact that it developed ESSENCE and only JHU APL personnel have access to ESSENCE's source code and algorithms.  This notice is not a request for quotations. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the performance work statement.   Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. EPA anticipates the award of a Cost Type contract.  The NAICS code designation for RFP PR-CI-08-10476 is 541511.  The anticipated award date is July 28, 2008.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, Direccion de Proveeduria del Ice, Mr. Jose Manuel Lopez Pinto, Ventanilla Unica del colegio los Angeles, Sabana Norte 300 Metros Norte, San Jose, Costa Rica, Phone: (506) 2205514, Fax (506) 2326616.  

Geotechnical Feasibility Study For The El Diquis Hydroelectric Power Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a financial feasibility study for the El Diquis Hydroelectric Power Project.  

The Government of Costa Rica and its national electric utility, Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), are committed to developing a reliable and economic supply of power for Costa Rica and to providing additional generating capacity to the regional Central American Electric Interconnection System (SIEPAC) grid.  

The El Diquis hydroelectric power facility (Project) is one of the larger projects envisioned to contribute power to the SIEPAC grid and thereby help stabilize the energy shortages in Costa Rica and the Central American region.  ICE launched a pre-feasibility study in 2004 for this Project with Inter-American Development Bank funding.  The focus of the first phase of the feasibility study was to evaluate the best location for harnessing the energy potential of the Grande de Terraba, Costa's Rica's largest river basin.  The site deemed most effective was called Boruca-Cajon.  Since phase one of the initial study was carried out, however, ICE conducted additional social outreach and environmental impact analysis until results determined that Baruca-Veraguas (El Diquis) was the most appropriate location.  Data indicated that the hydrology at the Project site was favorable, and the proposed site had a good capacity factor and proportionately high firm energy production.  The resulting Project is a 631 MW hydroelectric power plant.  

While the precise location of the Project was defined, additional analysis remains which calls for a full-fledged feasibility study, valued at $4 million, in order to move the Project toward implementation.   ICE turned to the IDB and Central American Bank for Economic Integration as well as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to complement their in-kind contributions to realize the full feasibility study for this Project.  USTDA is providing funds for a comprehensive financial analysis feasibility study.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $300,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:  

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.  

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 10:00 AM LOCAL TIME on April 22, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Government would be the direct beneficiary of a contract for this upgrade because it would substantially enhance the flow cytometric analysis capabilities of NIH scientists, both within the ETI Branch and the CCR/NCI.

The salient characteristics apply to the FACSCalibur flow cytometer:  1) three lasers and eight-color analysis using three lasers (488, 635 and 405 nm) and eight photomultiplier detectors (four aligned to the 488 nm laser, two aligned to the 635 nm laser, and two aligned to the 405 nm laser; 2) PC-based computer hardware and software system capable of acquiring 3-laser eight-color cytometry data in real time. 

Justification:  The NCI currently owns a simple BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer with a single laser and three fluorescence detectors.  The bulk of our flow cytometric analysis now requires instrumentation with a minimum capability of 5 detectors or more, currently carried on a single flow cytometer. 

Only one award shall be made as a result of this solicitation.

<SOLNBR>S08125
<RESPDATE>041108
<ARCHDATE>04262008
<CONTACT>Jennifer Thomas, Subcontracts Specialist , Phone 301/228-4004, Fax 301/228-4037, Email thomasj@ncifcrf-gov
<DESC>A.	Background

The National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) is an open source, open access information network connecting the cancer research community and enabling the sharing of data and tools.  Through partnership with the cancer research community, the caBIG initiative will speed the translation of research findings into clinical decision making, treatment, and improved outcomes.  caBIG enables research groups to tap into the rich collection of emerging cancer research data and facilitates the integration of diverse data types while supporting individual investigations.

The NCIs Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) conducted caBIG as a pilot during 2004-2006.  In view of the pilots success, NCI launched caBIG on an enterprise-wide basis (caBIG Enterprise).  The needs of this expanding community will be met through the offerings of the caBIG Enterprise Support Network (ESN), presenting new opportunities for cancer and academic medical centers, IT companies, and others to serve as support providers, mentors, and knowledge experts.  Participants in the caBIG ESN will play a vital role in seeing caBIG technology become an everyday part of cancer research and, in the future, an integral component of broader biomedical research and clinical care.  As part of that effort, NCI is implementing the first caBIG Knowledge Centers (KC) as a new component of support to facilitate the widespread adoption and integration of caBIG standards, tools and infrastructure by application end users and stakeholders.  Such users and stakeholders may include bench scientists, biospecimen managers, pathologists, clinical trialists, information technology administrators, institutional review boards (IRBs) members and administrators, technology transfer/licensing offices in research centers, sponsored research offices, patients and research participants.  The Knowledge Centers will work closely with their associated caBIG Workspaces, which will establish priorities for the activities to be conducted by the Knowledge Centers. The caBIG Workspaces will continue to identify needs and requirements, set priorities and strategic direction of the Workspaces, which may result in the issuance of competitive RFPs to meet these needs.   In addition, two complementary activities will be launched as part of the ESN  caBIG Service Providers and caBIG Program Offices.  NCI approved caBIG Service Providers will be available to provide comprehensive technical and end-user support.   caBIG Program Offices will be established at institutions and organizations interested in installing and deploying caBIG tools and infrastructure broadly throughout these entities.  In conjunction with caBIG Knowledge Centers, these other activities will provide the infrastructure needed to support the needs of the expanding caBIG community.

A caBIG Data Sharing and Intellectual Capital  Knowledge Center will be established at an institution that can demonstrate expertise in the specific area of focus or domain as listed in ARTICLE C.1.B.  Objectives.  Within this KC, individuals with caBIG experience and domain-specific expertise will be identified to fill specific roles related to caBIG outreach and tool integration.  In creating and staffing the KC, partnering with caBIG developers, caBIG adopters, future caBIG Service Providers, caBIG participants at other organizations or others who are expert in the domain areas of focus is encouraged.  Within the bounds of the specific domain, this caBIG designated Knowledge Center will possess the expertise required for more complex knowledge transfers, thus enabling the provision of specialized assistance beyond existing applications support and communication materials.  This expertise will also be leveraged by the Knowledge Center to identify and synthesize shared needs across the stakeholder community in the domain of interest.  In addition, DSIC Knowledge Center staff will ensure that these needs and other relevant issues and feedback are communicated to the appropriate caBIG program management personnel (e.g., DSIC Workspace Lead, NCI Facilitator for DSIC Workspace, and other caBIG program staff). While the KC staff may serve needs within their home institution, their primary emphasis will be externally oriented, reaching out to other institutions and organizations with interest in the specific domain expertise areas of focus offered by the Knowledge Center.  All caBIG Knowledge Centers and their specific expertise will be actively promoted by NCI caBIG Program staff to the wider caBIG community.

It is expected that the DSIC KC will be comprised of one full time employee, whose duties will include functioning both as the Knowledge Center Operations Manager as well as a subject matter expert; a part-time Knowledge Center Director who is a senior level individual with overall accountability for the KC; and additional staff  of subject matter specialists and junior support staff who will contribute subject matter and administrative expertise appropriate to completing the functions described in the Statement of Work (SOW).

?	Operations Manager.  The KC Operations Manager is responsible for day to day operation of the KC Center including overseeing scheduling and the development of the work products, delivery of services and direction of the staff of the KC.  The Operations Manager is also expected to serve as a senior subject matter specialist and to contribute personally and substantially to the subject matter activities (i.e., the development of products and delivery of services) as described in Section C  Work to be Performed below.  Approximately 25% of the Operations Managers time is expected to be devoted to managing the staff, products and operations of the KC while the estimated remaining 75% is expected to be devoted to the development of products and services as a subject matter expert.  The individual must have experience working with the caBIG program in one or more of the areas of domain knowledge focus for the KC and must hold professional credentials that demonstrate education and working knowledge in one or more of the areas of focus.  

?	Center Director.  The KC must be overseen by a senior level individual with professional credentials and established stature within the caBIG program appropriate to fill the role of Knowledge Center Director for the areas of focus.  The KC Director shall provide direction, guidance and oversight to the Operations Manager and will be ultimately accountable for the operation, services and products of the Knowledge Center.  The KC Director may also provide subject matter expertise and contribute to the development of tools, other products and services of the KC, as well as ensure the quality of the tools, products and services.

?	Subject Matter Specialists.  The subject matter specialists may be full or part time individuals of varying levels of expertise and experience in one or more of the three areas of focus:  regulatory, intellectual property and security.

?	Support Staff.  More junior support staff may be proposed to handle administrative functions, reporting functions and website maintenance, first tier handling of service requests, and other functions where less subject matter expertise is required.

The level of effort required to accomplish the work to be performed for the KC is expected to be approximately the equivalent of six full time staff, recognizing that this effort may be allocated among different individuals and may not be allocated equally over the time periods included in the period of performance.  Offerors are encouraged to propose allocations of time, numbers of individuals and allocations of duties among the KC staff and Operations Manager in the staffing plan that align staff with the Offeror?s vision for the KC.  For example, while approximately 25 % of the Operations Manager?s time is provided below as an estimate to aid Offerors in the preparation of proposals, the Offeror?s proposed staffing plan may include junior staff to assist the Operations manager in performing administrative functions as appropriate.  Two positions, however, should be proposed with the following in mind:  the KC Operations Manager is expected to be a full time individual who has no other substantial time commitments to other positions and can devote an average of at least 40 hours per week to the work of the KC; the Director is expected to be able to dedicate an average of approximately 25% of a full time work week to the oversight of the KC.

The DSIC KC will act as the steward of the data sharing support tools and documentation providing access and support to  individuals and institutions to realize the full value of the caBIG interoperable tools.  As such, the DSIC KC is expected to serve as the repository and to provide expert resources for developing the knowledge associated within the DSIC Workspaces designated area of focus, which includes the Data Sharing and Security Framework (DSSF).  When fully developed, the Data Sharing and Security Framework will include policies, procedures, informational materials, model documents and other tools that facilitate the sharing of data via the NCI cancer Grid (NCI-caGrid) infrastructure.  The DSIC KCs stewardship will take the form of providing access to the current release as well as to archived, prior versions of the tools and other supporting documents over which the DSIC KC has oversight.  The DSIC KC will act as a primary point of contact for information about the DSIC tools and provide mentoring services to caBIG developers, adopters, end users and stakeholders that engage in deploying the DSSF.  The DSIC KC will also provide expertise to the caBIG DSIC Workspace and develop draft policies, procedures and position papers as prioritized by the Workspace.

B.	Objectives

This statement of work details the plan to establish a caBIG DSIC Knowledge Center.  The DSIC KC will support data sharing between caBIG participants by addressing legal, ethical, regulatory, policy, proprietary, contractual and socio-cultural barriers to data sharing and information exchange.  The caBIG DSIC KC will be established at an institution with knowledge of the caBIG Program and with demonstrated expertise in the knowledge domain areas outlined in the statement of work.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Korean Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Yusong, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, for the purchase of an Automatic Weighing System for Gravimetric Preparation of Standard Gases (Korea Patent No. 0495483).

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  As NIST is expanding its services to include hydrogen standards, the Analytical Chemistry Division at NIST requires an Automatic Weighing System for Gravimetric Preparation of Standard Gas to weigh cylinders for primary standards.  KRISS is NIST?s counterpart of South Korea and are experts in the field of Gas Standards.  KRISS originally designed this Automatic Weighing System internally for use in their laboratories.  The Machine Shops at KRISS built this system and validated its use within the laboratories of KRISS.  This system is a highly complex mechanism to weigh gas cylinders to a reproducibility and accuracy of 1 mg.  The mechanism will alternate between up to three cylinders and a standard mass.  This system is built to precisely align the cylinder on a high accuracy balance, weigh the cylinder, and then move another cylinder.  This weighing is repeated many times to obtain a highly accurate weight in order to produce the highest accuracy gas standards.  KRISS is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Automatic Weighing System that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 27, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $2,000,000 for each period.  The total contract amount sha ll not exceed $10,000,000.  Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Es timated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract period.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimate Price of the option period being exercised.  At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the a nniversary date of that period.  The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $40,000.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Depart ment of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).  Firms should indicate pe rsonnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract and state their management structure.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

Contractor Performance Evaluations:  In accordance with the provisi ons of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedure s outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement.  For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000.00, the USACE will evaluate contractors performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Admi nistration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system.  After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days.  Accessing  and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer.  The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions.  The certificatio n software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.  Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil.  If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The Secretary of the Army Contractor Manpower Reporting (CM R) requirement will be incorporated into the anticipated contract.  The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor pe rsonnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported.  The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR require ment.

<DESC>Amendment: The site visit for this solicitation was held on 03/11/08.  The following clarifications resulted from this meeting. The date and time to submit proposals remains the same. 

1)  The Manual and Specifications guide provides specifications for both hard wired and wireless or remote control switch door operators.  The USDA would like for all door operators to be wireless or remote control switch operated.  

2)  Sketch 3 of 5 ? HDWR group-2:  Substitute the Northeast double doors for the Southeast doors down the same hall of bldg. 200.  No material changes since both doors are the same.

3)  Correction: The lab door is 267 (oilseeds) instead of 266.  No material changes since both doors are the same.

4)   Clarification: The intent of the interlock.  After business hours and on weekends, all doors are automatically locked and activated by magnetic strip cards issued to employees.  The automatic doors will be tied into the access system. After business hours, the valid, magnetic access cards will remain the primary unlocking/access mechanism and the automatic door openers will be the secondary access mechanism.  

5)  Due to the urgency of the requirement, the grab bar and toilet lift will be ordered separately from this contract.

<CONTACT>Marsha K Harrington-Evans Contracting Officer 919-956-5541
<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: 1.	QUESTION:  Is it possible to receive further clarification as to why the Service Contract Act Wage Determination is now being included in the Durham VA Homemaker Bid, as it does not appear applicable to the Home Care industry?  ANSWER:   FAR 22.10, Service Contract Act, applies to all Government contracts, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees . . . ".  Further, FAR 22.1002-1, General, states:  "Service contracts over $2,500 shall contain mandatory provisions regarding minimum wages and fringe benefits, safe and sanitary working conditions, notification to employees of the minimum allowable compensation, and equivalent Federal employee classifications and wage rates."   2.	QUESTION:  Apologies if I've missed it, but is there a stated time frame from contract award date to contract start-up? I've not found this in the Solicitation or any amendments and/or modifications. ANSWER:  Offerors must be ready to provide services immediately upon contract award.   3.	QUESTION:  If I understood correctly, offerors are only to complete blocks 12, 17, 23, 24, & 30. If that is the case, what do we enter in column 23 since column 21 & 22 are blank? Is column 23 supposed to be the hourly rate we are offering? ANSWER:  Offerors must complete blocks 12, 17, and 30a, 30b, and 30c of Standard Form 1449 (designation in bottom right-hand corner). 4.	QUESTION:  How do we confirm that the Durham VA received our past performance surveys? ANSWER:  Once the solicitation closes, the Contracting Officer will ensure that past performance surveys have been received for every offeror proposal received.  The Contracting Officer will contact any offeror whose past performance surveys have not been received.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT(S) OF CONTACT:  Contracting: Sean Seamon, NSWC Crane, Code 0564, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-5785.  Technical: Ken Burt, NSWC CRANE, Code 609, email LogR&D@navy.mil , 812-854-2139. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President?s hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the President?!  s initiative by being a ?first adopter? of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $2-4 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program at the Defense Depot San Joaquin, California (DDJC), Tracy, CA.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of a pilot project directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE, Hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD?s knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	DOD Hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program. 1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD?s largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America?s forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel, DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC?s 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified select DOD target site locations with electric-powered forklifts to host pilot programs for this BAA. Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in!   form, fit, and function and equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  New and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.    Site-specific information and requirements applicable to this BAA (Proposal Due Date, Site Visit Date, Site Location and Points of Contact, Operating Equipment Targeted for the Pilot Program, Equipment Duty Cycles, Host Site Procedures/Regulations/Utilities/Infrastructures, etc.) are provided at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm    1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.   ?	Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in form, fit, and function and equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in the forklifts proposed.  Other new and innovative approaches will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA. ?	Any award made must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or H2 infrastructure technology. The contractor should describe in detail how this project will advance the TRL and MRL of fuel cell system or hydrogen fueling station and infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen production, delivery, onsite storage and dispensing technologies.  1.3.	Business Case.  The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property ?	Operational data will be collected from multiple pilot programs conducted at various DoD locations and included as part of the MHE pilot program business case data.  The business case will be built on operational data collected during the use of the H2-powered equipment and hydrogen infrastructure in accordance with the ?Data Requirement Matrix? provided at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm.  ?	Business case data will be collected by contractor personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be provided to the procuring contract officer and the technical point of contact. The data will be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property. 2.

Offerors are cautioned that remarks and explanations provided at the site visit shall not change the terms of this BAA unless the change(s) is amended in writing.    This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). This BAA will be open until 28 April, 2008.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $2M and $4M for the DDJC project (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). The Government anticipates award of cost type contract/contracts, but will consider proposals of other contract types and reserves the right to award other contract types. More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and cannot be considered for funding.  Additionally, studies and theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation are specifically excluded.  All criteria set forth in FAR Part 35.016 are applicable. Proposals should be submitted in two sections: full technical and cost.  Technical and cost sections should be submitted as separate files. In addition to providing Cost and Pricing information as specified in FAR Part 15.403, cost information shall be provided in the format specified in the ?DDJC Cost Breakdown? spreadsheet provided at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm.  Each proposal is limited to 35 pages, including attachments and supplementary material.  Proposals will be evaluated by select Government representatives with non-Government (contractor) support used in an advisory role.  Contractor support companies used to advise the selection process are: Institu!  te for Defense Analyses (FFRDC); Logistics Management Institute (LMI); EG&G Technical Services, Inc.; and Male Duck Incorporated. Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria: ?	Overall relevance and scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort, including the plan and schedule for implementing the pilot programs, completeness of the data collection and comparison, turnkey solutions, and expected improvements in H2 fuel cell or hydrogen fueling station and infrastructure capability at the pilot program?s completion; ?	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights;  ?	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortia with H2 implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives;  ?	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-08-R-GS20 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.  Acordingly, please do not request a copy of a solicitation because none exists.  This is a sources sought synopsis (i.e. market research) to identify potential sources for the requirement described below:   

Requirement Description: the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) seeks a contractor to implement and evaluate the Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Planning Guide in two pilot states to determine the utility of the Planning Guide and implementation procedures toward strengthening GDL policy.  A draft statement of work (attached) provides background information and a detailed description of the services required.

1. Capability Statement:  Interested offerors are requested to submit a capability statement to the contracting officer Mr. Lionel (Lee) Nadeau, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at lnadeau@cdc.gov no later than March 31, 2008.  The capability statement should, as a minimum, address the following topics:

Experience developing, implementing, and evaluating needs assessments and/or planning guides.  Specifically the vendor should be able to assist states in assessing their strengths and weaknesses regarding their abilities to strengthen graduated licensing systems.  The vendor should be able to provide technical assistance to help states in their action planning and be able to evaluate the utility of the newly developed planning guide.  The vendor shall have experience and capability in developing and carrying out both process and outcome evaluations. 

Public policy and coalition building experience is essential, especially with respect to state policies and community coalition building.  The vendor shall have knowledge of issues regarding teen driving safety and risks teens face as new drivers, as well as knowledge about graduated driver licensing systems and other policies that affect teen driving.

Experience planning and conducting meetings.  In addition to setting up the logistics for a meeting, the vendor should have experience in meeting facilitiation as well as assisting states in developing action plans.  

The vendor shall be able to record minutes of the meeting and synthesize information from the meeting to develop a report.  Experience synthesizing policy information is important.

The vendor shall be familiar with the CDC?s programs, its approaches and its programs. 

It is desirable that the vendor have public health experience in the field of injury control, especially with respect to motor vehicle safety and graduated driver licensing systems. 


Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? or "generic" marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement (as reflected in the draft statement of work) and thus offerors should consider tailoring their capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to 10 pages.  

2. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).  Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate their business size status relative to the NAICS code 541720 $6.0 Million and indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. HUBZone, Small Disadvantage Business etc.).

This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes.  Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response.  This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required.  Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL AREA ANNOUNCEMENT / INNOVATIVE IDEAS SOUGHT FOR THE UPGRADE OF THE FLEET READINESS CENTER (FRC) EAST'S (FORMERLY NAVAIR DEPOT CHERRY POINT, NC) HEWLETT-PACKARD XP-512 STORAGE AREA NETWORK (SAN). FRC East is a Department of Defense (DoD) industrial facility responsible for the repair, overhaul and re-manufacture of DoD aircraft and components. Day to day operations within the facility are heavily dependant upon computer systems which are used for planning and scheduling workload, collecting employee time and attendance records, and a variety of other information management tasks. As currently configured, the SAN provides approximately 32 terabytes of storage. It offers advanced data management capabilities as well as predictive monitoring to detect abnormalities in system components prior to failure to allow the SAN to provide maximum uptime. The system interfaces to FRC East computers via a fiber channel fabric. Although a variety of data is stored on the SAN, its primary purpose is to support a HP-UX high availability cluster as the repository for Oracle database files.  The FRC East Information Technology Department is interested in determining whether to pursue a procurement to upgrade the existing SAN or replace it with a new enterprise storage system. The final solution must offer approximately 100 terabytes of storage capacity.  It should further offer the typical data management capabilities and diagnostic monitoring facilities commonly associated with modern enterprise data storage systems. The system should include integrated tape backup capability. Finally, it must interface easily with HP-UX (PA-RISC), Solaris (Sparc and X86), Microsoft Windows (X86), and Red Hat Linux (X86) computer systems. FRC East does not wish to limit consideration to fiber channel/SAN solutions, but is open to the consideration of IP and/or Network Attached Storage (NAS) or any other combination of technologies that will meet our enterprise data storage requirements. In addition to the technological solution, system engineering and integration services will be required to integrate the final solution into the FRC East IT infrastructure, including system reconfigurations and migration of data from the existing system. Finally, enterprise level maintenance support will be required for the storage solution to ensure business continuity for FRC East.  Companies responding to this request should provide information outlining, in broad terms, innovative and imaginative technological solutions to upgrade or replace the existing SAN.  Please include sufficient information to show your firm's technical expertise and capability to provide the equipment/hardware and software, system engineering and integration services, and three years of annual system maintenance.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis. Please include corporate information, including business size status.

<DESC>Purpose:
Air Mobility Command (AMC) has an need for the studies and analyses phase of the emerging Universal Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member (AECM) training system.  A preliminary Training Situation Analysis (early analysis) and a Training Situation Requirements Analysis (TSRA) are required to enable the development and containment of a System Training Plan (STP).  This approach is needed to fulfill the requirements of Air Force Instruction 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems and enable the prolonged success of the Aeromedical Evacuation mission. These Studies and Analyses will also enable the development of draft syllabi, lesson specifications, and the implementation of a training system concurrency strategy for the universal AECM training system.

This effort is needed in FY08 to support the development of the emerging AECM training system by FY09 for U.S. Air Force Active Duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and potentially allied nation AECMs.   The studies and analyses are needed to provide recommendations for, and the development of, a STP in accordance with the DoD perspective and intentions described in AFI 36-2251.  A Total System Approach is required to optimize total system performance and minimize total ownership costs by employing Instructional Systems Devlopment (ISD) principles from AFMAN 36-2234.  The urgency of the effort is required to support the acquistion of an AECM training device (long-lead item) and the establishment of a formal AECM schoolhouse

<SUBJECT>C -- C- USAID Mission to Guatemala, proposes to modify existing contract 520-C-00-06-00079-00 with Mr. Glenn Cameron under the Mission's Operating Expenses Program.
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Guatemala, USAID/Guatemala proposes to modify existing contract 520-C-00-00079-00 with Mr. Glenn Cameron under the Mission?s Operating Expenses Program.  The Mission requirement is a six-week extension of Mr. Cameron?s non-PSC contract without a change in the Scope of Work, the total estimated cost of the original contract will be increased by $14,969.30.   The primary purpose of the original contract was to provide engineering and construction oversight of the USAID/Guatemala OIB Project and provide monthly reports to the USAID Executive Officer.  The Contractor was responsible for ensuring that the developer followed established criteria provided by the Department of State Diplomatic Security, the Office of Overseas Building Operations and USAID?s Office of Security in the design and construction of a new office building for USAID/Guatemala.  This extension period will allow Mr. Cameron to coordinate final works being performed by the contractor to complete all requirements of OBO Fire, USAID Security and Diplomatic Security. In addition Mr. Cameron will complete and finalize the facility?s operations and maintenance manuals.  Therefore it is necessary to extend the period of performance of Mr. Cameron?s contract to allow him to complete the remaining objectives.  Issuing a new instrument and solicitation is not practical because of the additional costs, the short period of time required under the contract extension, the amount time required to establish a new mechanism and solicitation and the disruption of ongoing activities. The Mission does not anticipate contracting this type of service in the future as this is a specific project that will be completed by June 2008. This modification to contract No. 520-C-00-06-00079-00 is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays.  Expressions of interest with documentation of professional qualifications must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contact a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.

Subject: Combined Synopsis-Solicitation Notice for Global Architect-Engineer Infrastructure Services

Pursuant to the authority contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau of Economic Growth Agriculture and Trade, Office of Infrastructure and Engineering (USAID/EGAT/I&E) invites submission from all eligible U.S. Professional Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to provide engineering design and construction supervision services ranging from quick response and short and long-term services in the infrastructure areas of water resources, environmental/sanitary engineering, civil and industrial engineering, structural engineering, value engineering, industrial/chemical engineering, power and telecommunications to USAID/Washington and USAID Missions worldwide.

USAID is seeking registered professional engineers and/or licensed A-E firms that are either individual firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, or other legal entities permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering.  USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible U.S. or Non-U.S. organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services.

The selection of the Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm(s) will be conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented by FAR Subpart 36.6. 

As defined in 40 U.S.C. 1102, Architectural and engineering services are:
 (1) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, as defined by State law, if applicable, that are required to be performed or approved by a person licensed, registered, or certified to provide those services; 
(2) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature performed by contract that are associated with research, planning, development, design, construction, alteration, or repair of real property; and 
(3) Those other professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, or incidental services, that members of the architectural and engineering professions (and individuals in their employ) may logically or justifiably perform, including studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, plans and specifications, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, and other related services. 

TYPE OF CONTRACT/PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/ESTIMATED COST:
USAID intends to award a five-year multiple-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with an aggregate ceiling price up to $500 million.  The aggregate ceiling covers all contracts awarded under this solicitation.  USAID anticipates awarding approximately three (3) IQC awards.  The Contracting officer reserves the right to award more or fewer than three awards.  The maximum aggregate dollar value of all task orders awarded to all contractors cannot exceed $500 million.  The ceiling will not be subdivided amongst the contractors.    

Task orders issued under this IQC may be short, medium, or long-term in duration and may be issued by USAID/Washington and USAID/Missions worldwide.  The task orders will be issued using a Fixed Daily Rate format.  The IQC minimum guarantee per award will be $100,000.

SELECTION PROCESS:
USAID will evaluate all offerors based on the evaluation criteria as described below.  Based on the evaluation rankings a list of at least 3 of the most highly qualified firms per FAR Subpart 36.602-(3)(c) will be established.  These most highly qualify firms will be notified that they have been selected for discussions with the A-E evaluation board.  The A-E firms who are selected to participate in the discussions will be given specific guidance and instructions at the appropriate time and will be given approximately 3 weeks to prepare their response regarding concepts relevant to the scope of work.  Any information submitted and/or received during the discussion process may be used as justification for the final ranking of the firms recommended to the Selecting Official to make the final selection, in order of preference, to determine apparent successful offeror(s) prior to cost discussions.  Final selection of the most highly qualified firms and negotiation of the A-E contract will be done in accordance with FAR 36.602-4 and 36-606. 

Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions pertaining to the cost submission to the short-listed firms and those firms will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide a cost submission.  After two (2) weeks from receipt of the initial cost submission, if USAID and the A-E firm(s) are not able to reach an agreement, USAID reserves the right to terminate cost negotiations and to begin negotiations with the next most highly rated A-E firm.  Upon USAID and the selected A-E firms reaching an agreement, USAID will distribute a DRAFT contract for their review.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure from Bruker Biospin Corp the following:

Quantity of one (1) - Avance III 400 High Performance Digital NMR Spectrometer to include Support and Installation and three year full service contract. 

This instrument must meet all of the specifications designated below.  

Specifications:

There can be no stray field beyond the outer dewar of the magnet and it must remain homogeneous if placed within 6.4m of a large moving metal object, such as an elevator.  Due to tight space constrictions and mechanical working of Bldg 8, the instrument must be installed on the 4th floor of Bldg 8, Room 415.  This room is located directly adjacent to a refrigerated cold room and across the hall from the elevator.  The Bruker UltraShielded Plus magnet is the only magnet in the industry that can be installed and functional this close to other equipment and moving objects.

The instrument must be fully integrated into the NIDDK NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Network and data must be of a format that is recognized by our currently used data collection and analysis software, namely TopSpin 4.0 or higher.  The software program TopSpin is sold exclusively by Bruker Biospin.

Once installed, the instrument must meet rigorous specifications pertaining to signal-to-noise and sensitivity on the designated samples.  Historically and currently, Bruker has been and continues to be the only supplier that is willing to guarantee these heightened specifications.

Minimum ceiling height must be 2.5 m or less (ceiling height in 8/415 is 9ft)

Maximum 5 Gauss Stray Field from center of magnet must be 50 cm or less

Mandatory Specifications:

BBFO (Broad Band Fluorine Observe) room temperature probes shall be fully tested in terms of S/N, lineshape, resolution, stability, water suppression and gradient recovery.  All S/N tests shall be run using 1 ppm of noise.  Sensitivity measurements shall be performed on the following samples:  ASTM 0.1% ethylbenzyne; 0.5 mg/ml sucrose in D2O (anomeric proton); 0.5 mg/ml sucrose in 200 mM NaCl and D2O (anomeric proton).

Lineshape; lineshape shall be assessed using two samples; ASTM 0.3% CHCI3 and 2 mM sucrose.  Spinning and non-spinning measurements shall be performed in both cases and the spinning sidebands for CHCI3 shall be less than the Bruker specified maximum intensity.

Resolution:  resolution shall be assessed using ASTM 0.3% CHCI3, both spinning and non-spinning and sucrose (anomeric splitting).
Water suppression shall be assessed using a 2 mM sucrose sample in 10% D2O/90% H2O.

The recovery of magnetic field homogeneity shall be such that a signal acquired 200 microseconds after a 1 ms gradient applied simultaneously either in the x, y and z directions for triple x, y, z axis gradient probes (room temperature probes) or in the z direction for single z-axis probes (i.e. cryoprobes) at 50% maximum power, differs by less than 3% from that acquired without preceding gradient pulse.  This shall be measured for a sample of 2 mM sucrose in D2O using 1 Hz exponential line-broadening and identical phasing.

The dynamic range shall be at least 50,000:1 as measured for a 90 degree 1H pulse by a S/N of at least 60:1 on a t-butanol peak in a 1/10,000 1H molar ratio to water.  No spurious resonances shall be larger than 1/2000 times the largest resonance in the spectrum when operating in locked mode, using sample temperature control at 30 degree C and an air flow which is sufficient to change the sample temperature for 30 degree C to 25 degree C within 0.1 degree C I less than 3 minutes.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Simplified procedures as described in FAR 13.5 will be used for acquisition of these commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  The reference document number for this is 1300094970.  The incorporated document, provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23 and Defense Acquisition Circular 20080124.  The applicable NAICS code is 334119.  This equipment will be procured on a Brand Name or Equal Mandatory basis for Clear Cube Equipment.  The Government has been tasked to deliver Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) Mobile Integrated Communication System (JMICS) systems to support tactical and strategic intelligence communications in theatre.  The requested Clear Cube Workstation and Blade Servers will provide JMICS with a centralized computing solution that integrates all the functions of a traditional Central Processing Unit (CPU) to give full control over computing at a remote workstation.  JMICS requires a workstation that will provide a space savings, improve user ergonomics, and meet their Tempest/Emission Security (EMSEC) requirements.  The Tempest/EMSEC requirement limits electric or electromagnetic radiation emanations from electronic equipment, which Clear Cube can provide.  This requirement does not include options, spares, or refurbishments.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  Only the requested make and model will be procured because it identifies the required design that allows Clear Cube Workstations to remote CPU?s to user workstations while storing the CPU?s in secure locations that meet the Tempest/EMSEC requirements.  The Clear Cube workstation provides a solution by removing the clutter and allows for a more effective working environment.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 2 is to clarify the question about clearance in amendment 1 and to answer an additional question.

The following question is clarified from amendment 1, note that contractor personnel are to have a Top Secret clearance (the Top is now emphasized by astericks where missing before).
Question: Will there be a DD254 and what are the requirements?
Question: Is a facility clearance required?
Question: Do you expect the interpreter to have security clearance prior to the commencement of the contract? If not, would you accept proposal with a qualified interpreter that could begin the security clearance process upon beginning of contract?

Answers: A DD Form 254 (facility clearance for the firm) will be required for contract award. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens and possess a minimum level Top Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance.

The individual presented for performance of services must pass a background check as determined by the U.S. Secret Service. All contractor personnel assigned to this contact shall meet the following minimum qualifications:
1. The firm providing the personnel must hold a minimum level Secret facility clearance upon award. 
2. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens, and shall be required to possess a minimum level *Top* Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance. Documentation will be required to confirm such clearances, including date of clearance issuance, the Cage Code, a DSS/DISCO point of contact, and the address of the cognizant security office. 
3. All personnel will be working on the Government site and shall complete a Contractor Personnel Access Application form (SSF 3237), and must undergo a security background check by the USSS. The contractor shall provide personnel who can successfully pass the background investigation. 
4. Prior to award, the successful awardee shall be required to provide the name and contact information for the Contract Security Representative (CSR) of their firm. The CSR shall be the contact between the contractor and the USSS. The CSR shall handle all forms necessary to obtain security clearances and access approvals. 

Since Contractor personnel shall be required to have a *Top* Secret level clearance, the offeror must submit the following documents and others as required for each respective person immediately prior to award:
 
a. Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
b. SSF 3237 - Contractor Personnel Access Application (see Attachment 1)
c. SSF 4024 - Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (see Attachment 2) 
d. Provide evidence of the required security clearance for proposed personnel before beginning work. 
 
Question:  We have an interpreter in particular that fulfills all the requirements asked for on the RFP with the exception of her RID certification. She is currently waiting to present the practical side of the exam. Will this prevent her from being eligible for even being considered? According to the RFP, "Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected."

Answer:  If the interpreter is one of a pool of interpreters intending to be used by the vendor, their eligibility would be contingent upon completion of the RID certification. If the interpreter failed to obtain the certification, they would not be allowed to remain part of the interpreting team.

Computer equipment will be removed by the Government before furniture is lifted and/or moved.  The existing carpet and cove base in each room will be removed (taken-out) by the Contractor. Note: The used carpet and cove base will be disposed of by the Contractor. See paragraph 3.7 (Task 7) below.
3.1.4 Carpet Options:  Replacement carpet must meet industry standard of using 30% recycled material, meet specifications for heavy foot and wheelchair traffic, and be visually similar to the existing carpet (Mohawk Conqueror 22oz. Terra Earthen), installed in the adjoining hallways.  The pile/height/texture of the replacement carpet shall create a level surface between the offices and the adjoining hallways so as to prevent injury which could be caused from foot traffic entering/exiting the hallway and adjoining offices. Offerors are required to provide a two foot by three foot sample (or equivalent grade sample) to the government point of contact, Sam Pratton, at the address shown in paragraph 8 below.  All samples must be sent postage prepaid and must arrive on or before the scheduled closing date/time of the solicitation. Replacement cove base must be 4? vinyl, black.  
3.2. (Task 2) Moving or Lifting Furniture/other floor objects from each office.  Lifting of furniture with a furniture lift and/or moving furniture, in office spaces, will not begin until the Government has removed all computer equipment.  The Contractor will remove or lift all furniture, to include all objects occupying floor space, in each office space, in advance of removal of existing carpet/cove base.  If furniture is removed, the furniture must be moved to an area where carpet/cove base is not being installed.  The Government will determine the area that will be used to store the office furniture while the carpet/cove base is removed and new carpet/cove base is installed.  Desks, filing cabinets, storage cabinets and bookcases will not be unloaded since a desk mover, which will be furnished by the Government, will be utilized.  If furniture lifting rather than moving furniture is done, the Contractor will furnish the furniture lift.  Furniture moves will be performed Monday through Friday between 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
3.3. (Task 3) Existing carpet/cove de-installation.  After all computer equipment has been removed by Government personnel and all furniture/objects that occupy floor space have been removed or lifted, with a furniture lifter, by the Contractor, the Contractor will remove (de-install in advance of scheduled new carpet/cove base installation) old carpet and old base cove from each office space.  The Contractor will take the old carpet and old base cove to a staging area, determined by the Government.
3.4. (Task 4) Carpet/Cove Base Installation Schedule.  The final installation schedule will be arranged at an on-site meeting with the vendor to be held at Bldg. 801, Saufley Field, within 5 days of contract award.  Since workers will be present, the installation schedule will be performed in a phased approach to minimize disruption to the workers.  Installation will be performed Monday through Friday between the hours of 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.  
Note: there are no elevators in Bldg. 801.  Carpet/cove base for 2nd deck office spaces will need to be transported via stairway.  
3.5 (Task 5) Carpet/Cove Base installation must be performed under the guidance and supervision of a certified carpet installer.  Seam edges must be cut with appropriate tools based on carpet manufacturer recommendations.  To eliminate possible height variation at the seam, a sufficient amount of the factory edge or selvage must be trimmed.  Cut edges at seams must be sealed with proper seam adhesive applied as recommended by the carpet or adhesive manufacturer.  Rolling of installed carpet must be accomplished according to manufacturer recommendations.  
3.6 (Task 6) Furniture Move Back into Office and/or Lower Furniture on a Furniture Lift.  Furniture and other floor objects will be moved back into the office or lowered with the furniture lift by the Contractor, after carpet/cove base installation has been completed for that office.  However, if the carpet manufacturer has suggested a wait time before returning furniture/objects or lowering furniture/objects onto the newly installed carpet, the move or lowering of furniture/objects will not occur until after this period of time.  The Government will provide oversight regarding the correct placement of all furniture/ objects returning to the office which has replaced and installed carpet/cove base. Replacement of computer equipment will be done by the Government.  Furniture moves will be performed Monday through Friday between 0700 to 1800; Saturday and Sunday between the hours of 0700 to 1800.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:   solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Original Response Date is revised from March 9, 2007 to March 15, 2007.
QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:
1.  	Question:  We understand that the font size is 12.  Can the tables, graphics and figures be 9 point? Can you also please clarify does size 12"refer to 12 Point or 12 Pitch?
Response:  The requirement for the font size has changed for the SF330 from 12 to 10 or larger.  For graphs, tables, and charts the font size can be 9 or higher.
2.	Question:  In Section E-the wording in the solicitations says, The offeror must have, either in-house or through consultants,  the following disciplines that are licensed, registered or certified where applicable.  However no list follows.  Are we to decide, or will you send a list so bidders will be using the same categories?
Response:  Below please find the List of Disciplines that were inadvertently left out of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Please notice that the Program Manager discipline, number 35 has been added to this listing.

3.	Question:  Will all selected firms be required to prepare a proposal for every task order? 
Response:  Yes, the firms that are awarded an Indefinite Quantity Contract will be required to submit technical proposals at the task order stage.  These firms will be evaluated based on the firm?s technical capacity, including proposed personnel as it relates to the statement of work and other additional information as required. 
4.	Question:  Would you consider increasing the 17 page limit for Section "H" to 25 pages? 
Response:  The page limit for these two sections is 17 pages.
5.	Question:  As stated under ?Submission Requirements, our SF 330 submittal must be prepared using a font size of Times Roman 12 point. This font size is very limiting, especially considering the template of the 330 form, and is not consistent with the 10 characters per inch requirement. Is it acceptable to change this font size requirement to a proportional spacing Times Roman 10-point font to help us to provide enough information to address all of the requirements of our submittal, especially for the resumes in Section E and project descriptions in Section F? Also, if we provide any summary tables and figures as part of the Section H information, can we use a smaller font size?
Response:  It is acceptable for the SF330 to be prepared using the font size 10 or larger.   However, offerors can use font size 9 or larger for charts, graphs, and tables.
6.	Question:  The 1-inch margin specified is not consistent with the SF 330 template downloaded from the GSA website. Is it acceptable to prepare our submittal using the same margins as this template, which is approximately 1/2 inch on all sides?
Response:  Yes, the offerors can use the same margins as the template on the GSA website which is ? on the right and left hand margins.
7.	Question:  The instructions for professional qualifications are unclear. The announcement states that the offeror must have personnel with the following disciplines and that ?resumes must be no more than one page per discipline, for a maximum of 34 pages.?  However, the announcement does not provide such a list of disciplines required for personnel, unless the disciplines in question are the same as the seven areas of work referred to elsewhere ? water resources, environmental/sanitary engineering, civil and industrial engineering, structural engineering, value engineering, industrial/chemical engineering, and power and telecommunications. Are these the disciplines referred to, or are there 34 required disciplines, and are we required to submit one and only one resume for each? Please provide a list of the exact disciplines and key positions required for our proposed personnel.
Response:  Please see response to question number2.
8.	Question:  The instructions provide very clear page limitations for two sections of our submittal that are to be provided in Section H of the SF 330. These include a 15-page limit to address ?Specialized Experience and Technical Competence? and a 2-page limit to address ?Capacity to Accomplish the Work.? Are we allowed to provide any other information in Section H of the SF 330, and if so, is there a page limit?
Response:  No, the offerors can not provide additional information in Section H.  However, as stated on pages 3 and 4 for criterions Specialized Experience and Capacity to Accomplish the Work the page limits are 15 pages and 2 pages.  The maximum number of pages for Section H is not to exceed 17 pages.
9.	Question:  In the Technical Instructions, Item 1. Professional Qualifications, what is meant by "the following disciplines"? No such disciplines are identified in the text that follows. It appears from the context that there should be 34 such disciplines specified. Will USAID specify what disciplines are wanted, or should we specify the disciplines that we believe are necessary for performance of this work?
Response:  See response to question number 2.
10.	Question:  There is no mention of SF330 Part II; does USAID require submittal of Part II? 
Response:  Yes, offerors are required to complete SF330 Part II for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.
11.	Question:  What standards will USAID use for green buildings? 
Response:  USAID has no specific standards for green buildings.  However, the offeror must propose appropriate environmental standards, as applicable.
12.	Question:  With regards to the Global Architect-Engineer Infrastructure Services RFP. Could you tell me if this is a new project? Is there an incumbent firm? Is the incumbent firm eligible to resubmit? 

Response:  Yes, this is a new procurement for worldwide Architect-Engineering Services.  There is no incumbent for this procurement.

13.	Question:  The amendment to Solicitation M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274, posted on Jan. 24, 2007 under TECHNICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Professional Qualifications states that The offeror must have either in-house or through consultants the following disciplines that are licensed, registered or certified where applicable?.The offerors must provide resumes (Section E of SF 330) for these disciplines including consultants.  However, there is no list of disciplines for which resumes are to be provided to USAID under this solicitation.

Response:  Please see response to question number 2.

14.	Question:  Section E of SF 330 provides information on resumes for Key Personnel Proposed for this Contract.  Is the offeror to provide resumes for proposed key personnel only?  SF 330 also provides a list of 62 Disciplines ranging from Acoustical Engineer to Water Resource Engineer.  In lieu of key personnel, is the offeror to provide a resume for each of these disciplines?

Response:  Please see response to question number2.

Response:  Yes, charts and maps may be included on 11 x 17 paper.  However, the paper must be neatly folded to 8 1/2 inches x 11 inches and bound in the SF330.  The font size or charts and graphs may be 9 font or higher.	

29.	Question:  Are charts, maps, etc. included in the page count limitations? 

Response:  No, charts and maps are not included in the page count limitation.

30.        Question:  Is the page limit for section H a total of 17 pages and is the content limited to Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Capacity to Accomplish the Work, or is the total page limit higher and can summaries of how the 34 in section E combine to meet the specified professional qualifications criteria and the 10 projects in section F combine to meet the specified performance criteria? 

Response:  Section H is limited to the two criterions for a total number of 17 pages.

31.       Question:	The 34 specified disciplines do not include program management and logistical support.  Since these are critical functions, especially in first responder tasks, where within the SF330 are these professional qualifications to be detailed? 

        Response:  The program manager discipline has been added to the listing.  The program manager will be responsible for the overall guidance of the contract.

32.	 Question:  Are charts and graphs included in the page count? 

 Response:  Please see response to question number: 29.

33.	Question:  Under the section regarding Capacity to Perform Work, whereby we are requested to submit narratives of least three (3) $500,000 to $1 million individual projects simultaneously or one single design for a project with construction costs in excess of $20 million, is that instruction solely directed at the Prime firm's capacity to perform the work or should the capacity of subcontractors be included as well?

Response:  The narratives can be prime and subcontractors.

34.	Question:  In Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, it states that a draft Design Quality Control (DQC) Plan be provided in Section H. DQC Plans usually exceed 15 pages. Is it acceptable to present a brief summary of our DQC in lieu of the entire Design Quality Control Plan? 

Response:  The offeror must provide their best response within the number of pages provided in the combined synopsis/solicitation.

35.	Question:  No resume is required for a Program Manager and the page limit does not allow the inclusion of such. Will you amend the solicitation Section E page limit to add additional staffing such as Program Manager? 

Response:  Yes, USAID has added the Program Manager discipline.  Please see USAID?s response to number 31.

36.	Question:  Certain portions of Section H such as Specialized Experience and Capacity to accomplish the work have page limits. Is there a total page limit for Section H.?

Response:  Yes, Section H is limited to 17 pages.

37.	Question:  In the Submission Requirements, it states a requirement of "10 characters per inch" as well as a 12 point Times New Roman font size. Times New Roman, font size 12 actually measures at 14 characters per inch. Can the requirement of 10 characters per inch be deleted from the solicitation?

Response:  Please see response to question number 5.

38.	Question:  Can we use a smaller font size for tables and graphics (10 point font)? 

Response:  Please see the response for question number 01.

39.	Question:  Is Section F limited to 10 pages or is the Past Performance Section of Section H limited to 10 pages? 
   
   Response:  The Past Performance Section of Section F is limited to 10 pages.

40.	Question:  When does USAID anticipate completing the shortlist? 

Response:  A date has not been established at this time.

41.	Question:  What is the expected date for award of the contract(s) to the selected firm(s)? 	

Response:  A date has not been established at this time.

42.	Question:  Page 1 of the solicitation indicates that "USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible US or Non-US organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries". We currently have strategic alliances with organizations in a few of these countries. Should we include information on these firms in our response to this solicitation?

Response: Yes, if your organization is considering these organizations to be included as a part of your team.   

43.	Question:  In the Selection Process section, the solicitation states that at least 3 of the most qualified firms will be given 3 weeks to respond "regarding concepts relevant to scope of work." Is this for the Global IQC selection? Or is this for a specific project once the firm has been selected to be on the Global IQC?

Response:  Yes, it?s a part of the evaluation process for the Global IQC.

44.	Question:  In the same Selection Process section, the solicitation states that 3 weeks will be given to provide a cost submission. Is this at the same time as the aforementioned response to the scope of work? Or after the scope of work response has been reviewed?

Response:  After the scope of work response has been reviewed (after the SF330 submittal).  	
45.	Question:  "Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions pertaining to the cost submission to the short-listed firms and those firms will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide a cost submission. After two (2) weeks from receipt of the initial cost submission, if USAID and the A-E firm(s) are not able to reach an agreement, USAID reserves the right to terminate cost negotiations and to begin negotiations with the next most highly rated A-E firm. Upon USAID and the selected A-E firms reaching an agreement, USAID will distribute a DRAFT contract for their review." 

In terms of the general sequence/timing of the evaluation of costs submissions, shouldn?t USAID provide the selected, short-listed A-E firms with a DRAFT contract for review as a part of USAID's request for cost submissions, rather than after reaching an agreement with the firm(s)?  Please clarify USAID's thinking in this area.

Response:  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation USAID will reach an agreement with the firms on the cost proposal prior to distributing the contracts for the firm?s review. 

46.	Question:  Are letters of association permitted/required?

Response:  Yes, letters of commitment are required for subcontractors on your team.

47.	Question:  Are we allowed to include appendices for supplemental information?

Response:  Supplemental information can consist of letters of commitment, graphs, charts, and tables.

48.	Question:  Assuming that USAID awards multiple contracts under this solicitation, please explain how individual task orders will be assigned. Will each task order be subject to competition based on cost or technical capability? Or will USAID use some other process for awarding task orders?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

49.	Question:  Can USAID provide any more specific position requirements for key personnel under this contract? In particular, one of the 34 disciplines listed in Amendment number2 is ?project manager.? Is this intended to be our contract manager key person, and if so, what specific requirements must that manager have, besides the minimum requirements listed in the original solicitation notice, if any?

Response:  No, the project manager is not the contract manager.  The project manager is considered the task order manager and their requirements would vary with the assignment and nature of the task order.  The program manager (discipline number 35) is considered the contract manger.
50.	Question:  In the Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 01 ? Posted on January 24, 2007, under the section entitled ?Type of Contract/P

Subject: Amendment No. 4 to Combined Synopsis-Solicitation for Global Architect-Engineer Infrastructure Services

1.  The purpose of this Amendment is to request the identification of all major subcontractors from among those subcontractors listed in the SF 330s that were submitted to USAID.  The term 'major subcontractor' is defined as those subcontractors who will perform critical aspects of the architectural and engineering (A&E) work, or those that will perform at least 20% of the A&E-specific work in the proposal.

2.  Offerors must submit identification of major subcontractors, or a statement that there are no major subcontractors, by 5:00pm local time on Tuesday, 18 September.  Identifications or statements must be sent electronically to WHewitt@usaid.gov.
eriod of Performance/Estimated Cost:?; the award of 3 IQC contracts is anticipated with a 5 year ceiling of $500 million, and the ceiling will not be divided amongst the contract holders. 

How will the selection process work for award of a single task order under the contract? Will each task order or assignment be competed for between the three firms based on fixed daily rates, or some other criteria?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

51.	Question: Will all Rate Schedules quoted for the work be based on $US dollars and daily rates for each individual category of engineer, architect, and support staff? 

Response:  Yes.  There will be a fixed daily rate schedule in the contract that will be in US dollars for each of the 35 disciplines.

52.	Question: Where can we see a copy of the USAID Contract Document, terms and conditions related to Indemnification language and the Limitation of Liabilities associated with Architect-Engineer professional services work? 

Response:  FAR Subpart 36.6 provides information regarding contractor liability/responsibility for design errors or deficiencies.  No limitation of liability clauses are envisioned for this contract.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 50.403, the USG provides indemnification to contractors only in situations where ?unusually hazardous or nuclear risks? are present.  USAID does not intend to provide indemnification to contractors under this contract.  

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.

54.	Question: To receive credit for the 15% small and disadvantaged business concerns that perform work under the team, would that only apply to those who meet that criteria in the US, or could a company in a foreign country who was a team member count if they met the equivalent criteria in their country (thinking of South Africa or similar governments)? 

55.	Response:  No.  Non-U.S. team members can not count equivalent criteria in a foreign country.  Foreign countries are not qualified as small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO.: 04 - M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274:

This amendment number 05 revises the Agency?s response to questions 3 and 53 that were posted in Amendment numbers 03 and 04 on February 15, 2007; and incorporates new requirement on Marking and Branding Strategy under ADS 320 under the selection process section.  

3.	Question:  Will all selected firms be required to prepare a proposal for every task order? 

Revised Response:  In limiting the number of awards under this IQC, USAID hopes that most awardees will compete for most task orders.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Revised Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.  However, we respect the business decisions that may guide a firm not to compete for a particular task order.  Therefore, it is not mandatory that an offeror must submit a proposal for each task order.

Please incorporate the following requirement under the Selection Process, second paragraph, and first sentence:

?Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions and the Branding Strategy (BS) to the short-listed firms (see ADS320.3.2.2 and 320.3.2.3). Those firms will be required to submit a cost submission and Branding Implementation Plan and Marking Plan.  They will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide their cost submission.  
				essional engineers or licensed personnel to support work under this effort.  My organization is an IT/Telecommunications company who has, and currently provides IT/Telecommunications support to a myriad of government D/As.  We are trying to assess what registration or licensing would be required of IT/Telecommunication professionals working on the contract.  In perusing your list of disciplines several areas could fit IT/Telecommunications areas i.e., Communications Engineer, Computer Programmer, Electrical Engineer, Security Specialist.  What registration or licensing would be appropriate or acceptable?

Response:  The offeror should provide the industry standard for the telecommunications field.

16.	Question:  Task orders issued under this IQC may be short, medium, or long-term in duration and may be issued by USAID/Washington and USAID/Missions worldwide.   Please define short, medium or long-term in duration in number of days.

Response:  Short term is few weeks to few months; Medium term is up to one year; and Long-term is one year or longer.

17.	Question:  These most highly qualify firms will be notified that they have been selected for discussions with the A-E evaluation board.  Does the phrase discussions with the A-E evaluation board? imply an Orals presentation?     

Response:  Yes, we anticipate that the most highly qualified firms will be required to participate in oral discussions.

18.	Question:  How will information submitted and/or received during the discussion process be carried out -question and answer correspondence with the CO/COR?

	Response:  Offerors will be provided questions regarding concepts.  For the most highly qualified firms the Agency will provide instructions at the appropriate times.

19.	Question:  What is a singe design?  We are working under the premise that this is a single design.

Response:  The word in the sentence should read single.  Please replace that sentence to read:  3. Capacity to Accomplish the Work: The capacity to accomplish at least three (3) $500,000 ? $1 million individual projects simultaneously or one single design for a project with construction costs in excess of $20 million.

20.	Question: The evaluation will be based on documentation included in SF330, Section F - Part I Example Projects Which Best Illustrate Proposed Team?s Qualifications for this Contract. Offerors must provide a maximum of ten (10) examples.  What is the minimum number of example projects that can be submitted?

Response:  The minimum number of examples that can be submitted are 5 examples.
 
21.	Question:  Information for Section F is limited to a maximum of 10 pages.  Are pages single or double sided?

Response:  This page limit is based on single sided pages.
 
22.	Question:  The contractor may provide broad technical support and advice to participating host government entities and regulatory bodies in overall institutional  and infrastructure development, including, but not limited to, policy, legal, regulatory, financial and commercial development and reform, turn-key design/construction and/or partial rehabilitation, and equipment and commodities provision, human resource development and training, operations and maintenance improvements and private sector participation. The assistance will be planned and implemented in coordination with other donors, local and expatriate universities, engineering societies, capacity building organizations, provincial and local government and community groups, and private and public enterprises as required.    Will the construction be done by local/indigenous businesses (as opposed to US contractors)?  Is the intention to build local capability?  How will the construction contracts be competed?
 
Response:	Yes, it is envisioned that the construction will be done by local organizations.  Yes, its USAID?s intention is to build local capacity; and the construction contract will be full and open competitions amongst local organizations.

23.	Question:  Does the individual proposed to perform Engineering Economics and Institutional and Policy Reform need to have a Bachelor of Science in Engineering?

Response:  No, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering is not required; just a Bachelor of Science degree or whatever is appropriate for that field.

24.	Question:  These positions must have a minimum requirement of a Bachelor of Science degree, a minimum of five (5) years relevant experience in the proposed discipline, and the applicable licensing requirements.  Based on the amendment listing the positions for which resumes are required, is a BS required for all positions or would a BA also be applicable?   

		Response:  A Bachelor of Arts is also applicable.

25.	Question: The offerors must provide resumes (Section E of the SF330) for these disciplines including consultants. For this section, the resumes must be no more than one page per discipline, for a maximum of 34 pages. Does the Offeror need to provide a resume for all of the listed disciplines to have their bid considered?

Response:  The technical instruction for this criterion now requires 35 resumes based on the listed disciplines.  If the offeror does not provide 35 resumes then the offeor will be deemed non-responsive to the requirement.  These 34 resumes can be personnel/consultants from the prime contractor and/or the proposed subcontractors.
 
26.	Question:  Can a resume be used for multiple disciplines? For example, an Environmental Engineer with sufficient experience and a degree that also satisfies the Sanitary Engineer requirements?

Response:  No, one resume cannot be used for multiple disciplines.   The Agency is looking to assess the firm?s broad capabilities.  However, there may be some occasions where a specialist will be required to perform multiple disciplines.   

27.	Question:  The combined synopsis/solicitation for solicitation number M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274 states that A-E firms will be evaluated in accordance with criteria including the following: 1) professional qualifications?....(weight 25 points); and 2) past performance on contracts??..(weight 30 points).  For professional qualifications, bidders are limited to 34 pages (i.e., 34 resumes).  For past performance on contracts, bidders are limited to 10 projects.

Given the depth and breath of the overall architecture and engineering disciplines (water, environment, transport, power, etc.) that will be required to carry out the types of work envisaged under this contract (the transport sector alone, for example, can be disaggregated into more than two dozen sub-disciplines), the evaluation committee would be better informed regarding the capabilities of each bidder if the number of resumes AND projects were expanded to comprehensively demonstrate each bidder?s capabilities in each of the specified disciplines.  Will USAID consider expanding the number of resumes and projects to be submitted in the proposal?

Response: No, USAID will not expand the number of resumes and projects.  As indicated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, 35 resumes (Please see question number 2 where the Program Manager position was added) and 10 projects are required.
