<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, Ceramics Division, through the Acquisition and Logistics Division, NIST, intends to award a ten month sole source simplified acquisition to Materials Data, Inc. of Livermore, CA 94550.  The purpose of this simplified acquisition is to procure a turn-key system to convert/upgrade VAX-based X-ray diffraction facilities (which consist of four powder diffractometers), to a PC-based Windows system.  This will also include converting and migrating all current Siemens Diffractometer 5000 data files to the new system and confirming their compatibility/availability with the new Jade software.  This upgrade shall include all the necessary computer hardware, data-acquisition software, data-analysis software, installation, and training.  Additionally, the equipment to be upgraded has been extensively customized by NIST staff and includes parts provided by a number of different manufacturers.  The most important component for the needed upgrade is the interface between the diffractometer and the controlling computer, called a DataBox.  This particular vendor is also the supplier and manufacturer of the DataBox, and therefore the existing interfaces for all four diffractometers do not have to be replaced, as this vendor can upgrade them.  In addition, NIST has surveyed the technical market and knows of no other vendor who can provide state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction analysis software with all of the features needed, including a graphical pattern editor to remove spurious electrical noise; a d-spacing editor; overlays of up to 500 patterns and 99 standards; output to any Windows output device; recall of ICDD patterns by not only set and pattern number but by mineral name, mineral group, compound name, chemistry; 'thumbnail' image display and printouts; single, multiple, image-within-image, composite landscape and portrait image printouts; painting of peaks, annotations both vertical and horizontal and in different colors and sizes; reading major vendors' raw data files; universal import and export of ASCII files; file manager to edit, view, rename, delete, archive files; internal and external standard calibration of theta; profile fitting; macro tasks for automation of multiple patterns, and export of vector (scaleable) image files for use in other Windows applications such as Word, PowerPoint, etc.  This proposed requirement for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates in a written narrative format detailed information addtessing their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of detemining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such a document will be considered invalid responses.  A determiniation to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the descretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 18 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to Materials Data, Inc.
