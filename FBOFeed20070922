Point of Contact for this requirement is LaTanya Johnson at Latanya.E.John son@hq02.usace.army.mil. Scope of Work USACE National Contracting Organization   Warrant Management System(WAMAS) Modernization Project (FY07)  1.  BACKGROUND The US Army Corps of Engineers National Contracting Organization requires the need for an effective and efficient process for managing Contracting Officer Warrants and Grants.  The goal of  is to provide senior staff and managers with a management informat ion system that is customized for warranting Contracting Officers and delivering several business solutions to improve the organization performance and operations.  The Warrant Management System (WAMAS) will assist in expediting the warrant approval proces s, warehousing all appointed USACE warranted Contracting and Grant Officers data at one central location and generating managerial reports for decision makers. The Warrant Management System (WAMAS) automates the manual process of requesting and approving W arrants.  Three basic validation requirements are integrated into the system, which are education, training and work related experience.   The main objective of this system is to ensure warrant applications are processed (approvals, terminations, tracking and reporting) within an established time period in accordance to policy/procedures and maintain a knowledge repository for warrant data Th e initial concept design for the Warrant Management System was performed by Universolutions for the USACE in FY02 (DACW72-02-P-0117). The system has a feature to generate warrant certificates.   The concept of operations of the Warrant Management System is a web-based information portal.  This portal serves as the warrant data repository tool for contracting personnel involved in the contracting officer warrant appointment and approval process.  L imited access will be provided to Corps Intranet users only. The Warrant Management System will provide a centralized database, which will allow USACE contracting organizations to i) request, ii) approve, iii) generate, iv) review, v) validate and vi) track warrants online.  2.

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE ( See Attachment) 4.0 TASK TO BE PERFORMED 4.1 System Modernization There have been recent changes in USACE Contracting Community of Practice which has resulted in a transformation of the contracting infrastructure and contracting business processes. New policy and procedures for the issuance of warrants  for Contracting a nd Grant Officers coupled with changes in the education, training and experience requirements has generated the need to implement an automated warrant management system to support for different level of warrants/grants and monetary authority.   The existing Warrant Management System developed by Universolutions, LLC needs to be updated to meet the latest requirement of USACE National Contracting Organization.  This requires several new features to be added in the system.  The modernization to WAM SA should incorporate new requirements generated from the reorganization of the contracting office. With different level of warrants and requirements for education, training and experience, the system needs modernized to reflect new requirements for educat ion, training and experience in order to check if minimum requirements are met for the Warrant.    4.2 Reports Development New reports need to be added into the system.  This includes both detail and summary reports.  Detail reports should provide reports with detail information on warrants, warrant status, list of individual with warrants by district etc.  The summary reports  should include total warrants, number of warrant approval for each district, total termination, etc.   4.3 Transfer of Historical Data Every year there are hundreds of warrant request from all USACE district/center offices, DMEA and HECSA.  There are several hundreds of historical data that need to be transferred to the system.  Warrant data for many of the districts are stored in an MS E xcel format.  These data needs to be transferred to the Warrant Management System.   4.4 Test and update The system needs to be tested thoroughly.  The test results should be analyzed.  The system should be updated based on feedback received from the test involving both technical and user personnel.  4.5 Security The current system allows a user to register and use the system.  A user verification module needs to be added in the system so that prior to allowing the user directly into the system, verification needs to be done.  Users account should be activated onl y after completing the verification.  This is a role based system where accessibility should be assigned based on the roles.  Each division/district should be allowed to view data of their division/district only.  Contractor officers requesting warrant sho uld have access to only their warrant data.   The system should have SSL of 128-bit encryption for data transfer.    4.6 Deployment Once the Warrant Management System is tested and ready for deployment, it needs to be deployed at CEEIS Central Processing Center (CPC) network located in Vicksburg, MS.  A deployment document is required to ensure proper installation and configuration of the system.   4.7 Training A hands-o n training needs to provide to the users of the system prior to deploying the system.  An easy step-by-step training manual needs to be developed.   4.8 Documentation   A user manual needs to be developed.  This should be simple and easy to understand.  A deployment document outlining the details of installation and configuration of the system should also be developed.  A training manual which helps in providing user trai ning should be developed and made available to the users. 4.9 Maintenance Support During the contract year, a maintenance support plan is needed in order to ensure the system is functioning properly.   4.10 System Requirement The system should be developed in .Net 2.0 Platform with SQL Server 2007 and IIS server.  5.   DELIVERABLES AND PAYMENT SCHEDULES 5.1. Administration Deliverables  The contractor shall participate either physically or via telephone in biweekly project meetings for the duration of this work.

BRAND NAME:
The Command Security System currently utilizes Ironport C-30 as the mail gateway, which has been replaced by Ironport C350.  The C-30 is the email gateway and has been online for four years.  Ironport provides spam protection, virus protection, virus outbreak protection, dirty word search for classification purposes, email management, gateway clustering and central management features.  It is a hardware-based solution.  The use of non-Ironport security products would require additional personnel and training to implement and support the new security products.  This approach would negatively impact the Government in terms of cost and time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NLRB01-07-Q-0005 and is issued as an invitation to bid.  Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-19, effective September 17, 2007 and FAC 2005-20, effective September 6, 2007.


_____DESCRIPTION: Goal

Deliver 360 By Design training for up to 30 managers and supervisors in the NLRB Headquarters and Field offices.  

Program Content

The training consultant should be currently certified by the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) to use, administer and deliver 360? By Design training.  The NLRB has used this customized instrument for the past two years and before this time, used the standard Benchmarks version.  We will continue to use the 360? By Design assessment because it has been ?tailored? to address specific management competencies for NLRB managers and supervisors who participate in the program.  

Scope of Services

The consultant will meet with the Office of Employee Development to discuss the parameters of the program, to get answers to any questions he/she may have, and to establish a specific time frame and process for successfully completing the project.  

	Assessment Instrument Services:

	The consultant will arrange and pay for CCL to set up the internet 
administration of the 360? By Design instrument and manage all of the associated processes to complete the full program.  This will include purchase of the instruments, troubleshooting problems for participants, request and dissemination of reports, and analysis of the results for one-on-one meetings with participants. 

Classroom services 

The consultant will meet with Headquarters participants in a classroom environment on two occasions.  The first meeting will be to introduce the program and explain the 360? By Design assessment framework and process.  The second meeting will be conducted after the assessments and will be to explain assessment results and to answer any questions participants may have 

The Field office participants will meet with the consultant by videoconference for their sessions.  To allow for maximum participation and interaction with the consultant, Field office participants will be equally divided into an appropriate number of videoconference sessions.  A room will be provided for the consultant which will include all of the needed equipment and data to conduct these meetings successfully.  The established schedule for these sessions will take into consideration the different time zones that participants may be in.

Individual consulting services

On a mutually agreed upon date after the 360? assessments are received, the consultant will meet with each participant one-on-one to discuss the results of their feedback reports.  Also, after the reports are given to each participant and before this one-on-one meeting occurs, the consultant will talk with each Headquarters participant by telephone to determine their level of understanding of the materials and the information contained in their feedback report.  The consultant will conduct telephone discussions with Field office participants on an as needed basis.  

The consultant will provide participants with action planning documents to be used as a tool in updating MDP goals and in preparing for the one-on-one meetings in general.    

Headquarters managers will meet with the consultant once on a one-on-one basis to focus on individual assessment results, how to use the data to change or improve their performance and how to incorporate this into an update or enhancement of their current Management Development Plan (MDP). 

Due to the nature of the training in a videoconference environment, we have decided to forego the second group meeting of Field office participants with the consultant.  Instead, we would like to have two individual meetings of Field Office participants with the consultant.  The first meeting will be conducted after the assessments and will be to explain one-on-one the assessment results and help the manager with reading and understanding the full feedback report.  The second meeting with the manager will be to help him or her focus upon assessment results and how to incorporate the feedback into plans for changing or improving their MDP?s. 

_____OPTIONAL SERVICE

	We would be interested in obtaining bids for the following work under a separate category we would like you to title Optional Service.

Optional Service A:  Use and administration of a companion leadership style inventory during the same time frame as the 360? By Design.  The bid should cover cost of all instruments, processing of data from the instruments, and discussion of the inventory results during the individual session with the consultant described above.
	
_____PROGRAM EVALUATION

At the end of the last session, the consultant will have each participant complete a program evaluation designed by the Office of Employee Development (OED). Copies of all completed evaluations will be made available to OED?s program manager.

The consultant will meet with OED at the conclusion of the project to discuss accomplishment of the program goals.  The consultant will submit a summary report with recommendations for future iterations of this training to the OED project manager.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002
The following AMENDMENT 0002 is hereby issued to re-issue the following combined synopsis/solicitation as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V0336972365826; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) the following items;
CLIN 0001 ? Provide and Install Vinyl Tile:.  REMOVE THE EXISTING DECK COVERING (DECK TILE, CARPET, ETC.) INCLUDING UNDERLAYMENT, ADHESIVE.  GRIND ALL UNUSED BRACKETS AND CLIPS DOWN TO BARE METAL SURFACE.  CHIP AND GRIND SURFACE SMOOTH IN WAY OF REMOVALS.  PREPARE DECK SURFACE, PRIME AND PAINT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GEN SPECS SECTION 631.  INSTALL UNDERLAYMENT MATERIAL WHICH COMPLIES WITH MIL SPEC MIL-D-3135 TYPE II.  INSTALL ASBESTOS-FREE DECK TILE COMPLYING WITH ASTM-F-1066.  UNDERLAYMENT AND DECK TILE TO BE INSTALLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GEN SPECS SECTION 634.  ADHESIVE USED FOR INSTALLING DECK TILE SHALL COMPLY WITH MIL SPEC MIL-A-21016.  COLOR OF DECK TILE TO BE DETERMINED BY SHIPS REPRESENTATIVE..  The area of decking measures approximately 6834SF as follows:  LOCATION (contact Contracting Officer Scott Wilkins at scott.wilkins@navy.mil for one technical attachment).  Note:  This list of spaces shall be considered an estimate only.  Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship?s designated representative(s).  The 6834SF does NOT include ?underlayment? + Vinyl Tile.  This approach would only produce a total VTC coverage of 3417SF.  The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and VTC so that final project completion shall result in 6834SF of VTC installed.
Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 30 NOV 2007.  FOB Point Destination Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk, VA 23511.  This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as Elizabeth City, NC, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for possible Ship / Contractor pre-performance meetings and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Contractor geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   An official site visit is not scheduled.  
At minimum, responsible sources should provide this office: a price proposal on letterhead /or a SF1449, either a price proposal on letterhead, or a SF1449 that should show the requested items; with their unit prices, extended prices, total price, prompt payment terms, remittance address, Tax I.D. #, Duns #, Cage code. Responses to this solicitation are due by 26 SEP 2007 at 1630 (4:30 P.M.) EST.   Offers can be faxed to (757-443-1402), or emailed to scott.wilkins@navy.mil.  Reference RFQ V0336972365826 on your proposal. [FSC= 7220].  Numbered Notes; Number 1, the proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. NAICS 336611 (1000).
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contracting Officer shall consider the following in regards to evaluation iaw FAR Part 13; Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm?s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer?s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror?s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror?s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror?s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror?s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government?s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor?s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor?s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors? Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror?s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror?s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN 2004) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003)(a) Inspection/Acceptance Addendum:  Contractor shall expect a reasonable degree of pre-acceptance inspection by ship?s representative(s) to validate and confirm all final product conforms to the specifications described in this solicitation and in conjunction with what is considered industry standard on U.S. Navy vessels here in Norfolk, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (JAN 2004) within this clause, the following clauses apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.219-06 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003),   52.222-19 Child Labor?Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (JAN 2004)(E.O. 13126), 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (APR 2002) (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998) (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 (JUL 2005), 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent rates for Federal Hires (MAY 1989), 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (OCT 2003) (E.O.S, proclamations, and statutes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of Treasury), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3322), FAR 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests (DEC 2003), FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (OCT 1997).
