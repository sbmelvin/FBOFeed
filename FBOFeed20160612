<DESC>The Portland District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract to the Nez Perce Tribe, 120 Bever Grade, P.O. Box 365, Lapwai, ID 83540-0365 in accordance with FAR 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Service:<br />Portland District has a need to identify Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) and historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Tribes (HPRCSITs) through the gathering of oral history data regarding traditional journeys undertaken by Nez Perce (NP) Tribal members from the Nez Perce reservation to Celilo Falls on the Columbia River. This data will assist in establishing the traditional cultural context of archaeological sites, hunting areas, fishing areas, gathering areas, and other areas used by Tribal members that fall within the established area of potential effect (APE) for the Corps's Bonneville, The Dalles, and John Day Projects established in September 2011 by the Wana Pa Koot Koot Federal Columbia River Power System Cooperating Group.</p>
<p>The study produced for this contract is intended to directly support the Corps's obligation to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act by identifying and documenting TCPs and HPRCSITs. This will be accomplished through the gathering of oral history data regarding TCPs known to the NP Tribal members and identified to the Corps. The primary deliverable of this contract is a final report of oral history interview results highlighting material relevant to the subject, with a bibliography, and maps of locations identified from the interviews. The information will be used to identify areas within the APE not previously identified as traditionally important to the NP and areas in need of further research and studies to potentially link TCPs, HPRCSITs, and archeological sites with oral history data.</p>
<p>Interested vendors must be authorized to represent and speak on behalf of the Nez Perce Tribe.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:<br />All responsible sources may submit a response, which if received timely, will be considered by the Portland District. This special notice/synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses received by June 27, 2016 at 4:00pm Pacific Standard Time will be considered by the government. Responses can be sent to the point of contact by email. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>
