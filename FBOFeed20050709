  Department of State, Office of Logistics Management, Acquisition Management, 
  P.O. Box 9115 Rosslyn Station, Arlington, VA, 22219

Description

  This public announcement is being issued as required by the Office of 
  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised), dated May 29, 2003.     
  The U.S. Department of State (DoS) announces its intent to conduct an A-76 
  competition to determine whether the work described below in support of the 
  Human Resources Career Development & Assignments Division (HR   CDA) will be performed by the Federal Government or by a private source.  The duration of competition will be 18 months (if needed), with a performance announcement expected on or about 15 March 2006.     

 DoS/HR CDA consists of two units, the Assignment Officer Unit and the Assignment Technician Unit, composed of 17 full time equivalents.

  DoS/HR CDA intends to conduct this acquisition using the Standard Competition 
  Procedures as provided in the OMB Circular A-76.  Further, the intent is to 
  make one award to a single service provider who would be responsible for 
  providing all of the technical and business services under study.   HR CDA does 
  not intend to make separate awards for each business and technical service 
  under study.   In general, the selected business and technical services 
  under study and type of work to be performed under each service area include 
  the following:
  	
Assignment Officer Unit:  Assignment Officers (AOs) have Bureaus as their “clients,” representing all regional and functions Bureaus in the assignments process.  AOs present the Bureau views at assignment panels.  They counsel and advise Bureaus on HR/CDA policies and procedures throughout the bidding cycle, bring bureau candidates to panel, ensure all eBid entries are accurate, recruit for hard-to-fill positions, and negotiate timing and training schedules during the summer transfer season.  The unit also prepares the Bidding Tool, the bid audit program in eBid (formerly “bid count cable”), and oversees the hard-to-fill exercise and the service-need-differential and out-year-world-language programs.

Assignment Technician Unit:  Assignment Technicians issue post assignment travel authorizations (formerly TMFOURS) for employees transferring from one assignment to another, for appointment, separation and home leave/round trip travel, and advance and separate maintenance travel for eligible family members.  They provide 
advice related to shipment allowances and access to storage as outlined in the travel orders.  Technicians process reassignment personnel actions upon receipt of the arrival notification as well as certain other types of personnel actions.  Upon receipt of a Residence and Dependence Report (OF-126), technicians approve and enter into the system changes in eligible family member status, as well as changes in home leave, legal residence, and service separation addresses.  They prepare requests for passport services (DS-1640) to enable transiting employees and eligible family members to obtain diplomatic passports and visas.  Technicians are not responsible for Personnel Actions related to appointments, promotions, within-grade increases (unless the due date is wrong), awards, benefits, or retirement actions, or for corrections in the payroll system that are not controlled by the employee’s location.  They also cannot locate or track shipments.  However, technicians can tell you whom to contact for these services.  Clients are currently divided alphabetically regardless of grade or skill code.

Approximately 17 full-time equivalents are currently performing these selected activities (9 civil servants and 8 foreign service personnel).  The U.S. Department of State office of Human Resources Career Development & Assignments Assignment Division is currently operated out of Washington, D.C.

The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) for the Agency is Frank Coulter, Assistant Secretary for Administration (Acting).  The Agency Tender Official (ATO) is Maurice Parker, HR CDA Director; and the Contracting Officer (CO) is James S. (Steve) Rogers.

Potential offers are encouraged to monitor this web site for additional information regarding this procurement.  All questions concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to Mr. Rogers, Contracting Officer, at rogersjs@state.gov.
