Award to any other source would create unacceptable delays in meeting the Governments requirements, resulting in an inability to complete required program testing and leading to a failure to obtain required milestone approvals. 
No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued with respect to this procurement.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  Questions shall be submitted in writing to the U.S. Army JM&L LCMC, Attn:  Norman Bonano, Contract Specialist, at norman.bonano@us.army.mil.  TELEPHONE INQUIRES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFOMRATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract to Noblis, Inc. on December 1, 2009 to provide technical support to the Data Communications program.  This support includes benefits modeling work as well as highly skilled engineering activities such as system thread and performance analyses.  These analyses are required to ensure completeness and correctness of Data Communication requirements and to document the operational and technical rationale supporting the Data Communications performance requirements.  These analyses will result in the final Data Communication technical specification, to include: Systems Functional Architecture Document, System Thread Analysis Document, System Performance Architecture Document, System Loading Analysis Document, En Route Automation Specification, Tower Data Link System Specification, as well as the Monitor and Control specification.  Work will continue in order to complete benefits modeling for operational scenarios, such as Revised Departure Clearance.  
The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to award a non-competitive contract to Noblis.  The FAA has determined that it is critical to continue work on an uninterrupted basis with Noblis until such time as the Data Communications requirements for the En-Route environment are developed and awarded.  For the last nineteen months, Noblis has supported the FAA in the above tasks under the Data Communications program.  To successfully finish these tasks, continuity of support is required.  This award will allow the FAA to maintain continuity and consistency in development of the benefits modeling and specification development without any delay to our JRC milestones.A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Vito Pietanza, Contracting Specialist by 10:00 A.M., Eastern Standard Time, Monday, November 30, 2009. 
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this announcement.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a the services of an organization with existing anddemonstrated expertise in mechanical finite-element modeling (FEM) of thin, segmentedoptics and in x-ray optical systems. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) isundertaking a one-year study to optimize alignment and mounting processes for integratingthin, segmented mirrors into a Wolter-1-type x-ray mirror assembly. The immediate goal ofthis study is to identify, analyze, and test hardware and procedures for improving theimaging performance of the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) for the Astro-H mission. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory(SAO), in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138.  SAO has extensive experience withhigh-fidelity mechanical and optical analyses of thin shell x-ray optics. Specifically,they are modeling mountinginduced distortions in ultra-thin x-ray reflectors andtechniques for assembling heavily nested mirror modules while preserving the reflectorangular. This acknowledged expertise is exactly what is required for the MSFC analysis.SAO combines the highly specialized knowledge of x-ray optics with the necessarymechanical modeling tools specifically developed and experimentally validated for thisapplication.  The required analysis is part of a Headquarters-requested, MSFC-led feasibility study forimprovements in optics scheduled to be flown aboard the Japanese ASTRO-H mission in 2014.The work is thus tied to a flight schedule, with a preliminary design review scheduledfor at the end of FY 2010. To support this, it is vital that the feasibility study beconcluded within approximately one year, and this in turn means that the requested 1-yearmodeling effort must be started prior to the end of 2009. This urgency reinforces thedesirability of SAO performing the modeling effort, as they have the necessary tools andexpertise to start immediately and complete the effort on time, with no additional delayscoming up to speed with the problems and no delays compiling the necessary computermodels.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. MarshallSpace Flight Center local time on December 4, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualificationswill be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to competethis proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to thisnotice, is solely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The design will be based onthe existing LVIS instrument, and will utilize several componet designs (i.e. theaircraft structure, the pressure enclosure, and the data system) that were recentlydeveloped for the Cloud Precipitation Lidar (CPL) on the Global Hawk.  The new LVIS-GHinstrument will incorporate some of the latest in NASA and commercially-developed lasers,detectors, digitizers, and imaging systems resulting in an autonomous, high-altitude,wide-swath, full-waveform laser altimer for use in the NASA Global Hawk aircraft.  Thiseffort will provide the mechancial, electrical, optical, thermal infrastructure andhardware, aircraft mounting structure, and electrical control and data collection systemfor this instrument.  This effort will also include the integration of severalGovernment-provided components and subsystems for integration and ground-based testing ofthe entire system on the Global Hawk aircraft. This task under the HBS contract will beperformed utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.  NASA/GSFC intends to award a new Task 043 under Contract No. NNG09HP08C with Sigma SpaceCorporation,4801 Forbes Blvd., Lanham, MD 20706.

<DESC>TITLE REPORT SERVICES – STATE OF CALIFORNIA

IRS requires certified title reports for private and commercial real property (e.g., Lot Book, Chain of Title, Grant Deeds, etc.) as recorded, in the fifty-eight California Counties.  IRS does not require and is prohibited from the purchase of Title Insurance, but will require certification that the data and history provided on any report(s) ordered is complete and accurate.  

Individual reports will be ordered as required, for a one year period, for delivery of the report specified to the IRS within 10 days.  IRS currently orders 400-500 reports annually from Title Insurance providers within California.  An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) Award will be made to the small business contractor, or small business contractors, who demonstrate their ability to provide the required reports, at prices deemed to offer the best overall value to the Government.   Administratively, IRS desires the minimum number of providers that ensure coverage for all California counties; therefore multiple best-value awards may result, if a single contractor cannot provide full coverage at prices evaluated to offer the best overall value.  Award under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be made.  An award is anticipated on or before November 2, 2009.

All responsible small business concerns are encouraged to submit a quotation.  Interested providers should contact the Contracting Officer for a copy of the request for quotation, which will be available on August 13, 2009.  No telephone requests for the RFQ will be honored.   Requests may be faxed to 510-637-2110 or e-mailed to jim.gensler@irs.gov.   Requests should include the name of the company, address, point of contact: name, telephone number and e-mail address, and the contractor’s DUNS number.  

NOTE:   Awards can only be issued to a contractor with an active registration in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov.  This registration must be active no later than the due date of the quotes to be eligible for award.  For registration assistance, please call 1-888-227-2423.  See Numbered Notes: 1 & 25.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award on sole source purchase order to Nikolay Novikov for the study Pharmacology and Physiology of the Substantia Nigra and Basal Ganglia.  This study focus on determining how drugs which modify dopamine receptor stimulation affect dynamic patterns in neuronal spike trains and local field potentials in basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits in conjunction with changes in cortical function.  To study neurophysiological changes associated with stroke and the effects of dopaminergic agents on these changes, we need to establish techniques to compare patterned and oscillatory activity of neurons within cortex and in the basal ganglia and interconnected brain areas such as the basal ganglia.  This study will be integrated with imaging studies conducted by collaborators and will allow insight into the neurophysiological basis of changes observed with imaging techniques.  

Nikolay Novikov has experience with rat anesthesia and surgery, including vein and artery cannulation techniques and experience working with the electrode construction and recording techniques in the rat, and with monitoring rat behavior. Mr. Novikov has been trained with the software computer programs necessary for displaying the data from the recording studies in the context of the needs of our laboratory.  He also has the experience with histological techniques and thus the skill to effectively process the rat brain tissue after the experiment for histological confirmation of the recording sites.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1338812 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Burnham Polymeric, Inc., 10036 Saratoga Road, South Glen Falls, NY 12803 on a sole source basis for the furnishing of Fiber Optic Marine Cable (FOMC).  Burnham Polymeric will apply the special high strength coating using their patented proprietary process over an optical fiber.  The government does not possess the data necessary to compete this process.  The Government has verified through the "sources-sought" process that there are no cables currently available that meet the needs of the Navy. Burnham Polymeric was able to develop a process that produces a FOMC that meets all size and performance requirements, and withstands and have the ability to withstand at least 35,000 psi of crush force for 1 minute without permanent damage while withstanding the environmental stresses (marine biological attacks (by crustaceans)).  Total quantities are estimated at 2.5 million meters of FOMC.  Projected delivery rate will be up to 40,000 meters per week.

<DESC>This effort is part of a larger program termed Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance. The overall goal of the Actionable Intelligence Enabled by Persistent Surveillance program is to enable the ISR-C2 enterprise to respond to asymmetric and irregLJlar warfare threats. It will accomplish that in part using small, low cost, highly capable persistent surveillance sensors mounted in Tier II or Tier III class Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) combined with decision support tools to expose enemy networks and vulnerabilities. This effort will focus on the development of appropriate Electro-Optics/lnfrared (EOIIR) sensor system technology to support the overall program.
There are a number of key capabilities required for the ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) area surveillance system. One is the ability of the sensor system to survey a wide area with adequate resolution to enable overall situational awareness of moving objects, including personnel. Another is the ability to achieve enhanced resolution in a selected region or regions of the image for the purpose of classification and identification of targets and target details. A third is the ability to perform appropriate pointing and stabilization actions, as well as any needed optical zoom functions, with no, or at least a minimum, of
mechanical parts. A fourth is being able to perform the first three functions within the size, weight, and power (SWaP) required for a Tier II or Tier /II UAS, such as a Shadow 200. A more detailed discussion of the required capabilities will be presented in the Design and Performance Goals section of this BAA. In general, however, the intent of this effort will be to develop a sensor system with the optical performance characteristics listed above that does not depend on a conventional gimbal to perform pointing and stabilization functions, and does not depend on complicated mechanical motion for optical zoom functions. Removing these mechanisms reduces the weight and cost of the sensor system and enables it to achieve a SWaP appropriate for the target UASs.  It is understood that certain mechanical systems may be necessary in the final sensor system design. It is also understood that the choice of a visible sensor or an IR sensor, or both, will depend on a number of tradeoffs concerning the system SWaP. Assuming that the SWaP requirements are met, the prime goals of the sensor system will be to achieve large area surveillance with the ability to zoom into at least one region of the image. Note that the sensor system is not the only component of the payload. Other processing and communication resources will be necessary in the final, combined, actionable intelligence payload.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command, AFRISS-TF Program Management Office is seeking information from industry regarding approaches and related risks associated with migrating an existing data base system (Air Force Recruiting Information Support System) employed by Active Duty Air Force Recruiting Services and by the Air National Guard, into another existing data base system (Air Force Recruiting Information Support System-Reserve) employed by Air Force Reserve Recruiting Services. Both systems apply an Oracle 10g database. Once combined into one system (AFRISS-R being the baseline), the new system will be known as Air Force Recruiting Information Support System-Total Force (AFRISS-TF). The intent of this RFI is to provide the AFRISS-TF Program Management Office with market research and insight to help assess the capability of available technologies, and the long-term visibility of potential approaches and solutions to integrate the two systems indicated above into the AFRISS-R baseline with subsequent limited sustainment of the new system. The solution must support a secure system, applying Business Rule Information Management (BRIM) to create, amend and adjudicate information on applicants seeking entry into the Air Component. In addition, the new system must be able to produce a myriad of reports, and provide and receive data to and from other external agencies.
<p>This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Air Force, Air National Guard, or the Air Force Reserve to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to the RFI. This RFI is in no way binding to the government. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this request. The information will be used to facilitate acquisition planning; any proprietary information will be handled accordingly. The determination of an acquisition strategy, based upon comments submitted by interested parties in response to this RFI is solely within the discretion of the government. The NAICS Code 541512, Computer System Design Services, is subject to change based on market research and input from industry to the Program Office.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the requirements stated below, for information and planning purposes pursuant to FAR 15.201 (e).  This is not a synopsis preceding the issuance of a solicitation.  Rather, it is market research issued solely for information purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA).  The Government has no specific plans for procurement at this time.
This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Acquisition Services Directorate and Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought is voluntary. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be distributed via the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website. It is recommended that interested parties monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. 
Summary:This is a request for information for the purpose of obtaining market research to find potential offerors who may be able to modify their software application allowing the training audience to interact with autonomous socio-cognitive agents by playing the followers and leaders of contending factions. The training audience will be taught Counter-Insurgency (COIN) theory and Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations (SSTRO).  In order to field the training capability in the minimum amount of time, the government seeks to leverage an existing application that already offers "sim-city" or "sim-village" capability with emergent behavior from autonomous socio-cognitive agents.  The software will support a player through surveying the social landscape, making friends/co-opt the agenda, and fostering self-sustaining institutions so the player learns to use given resources judiciously and in a culturally sensitive manner to achieve a positive outcome. The software is intended to teach Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations (SSTRO) objectives.  
RESPONSE DATE: 12/04/2009
DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED:The government is looking for preexisting software toolsets based on validated models supporting profiling and emulation of ethno-political actors and factions around the world. The concept allows the trainee(s) to interact with autonomous socio-cognitive agents exhibiting emergent behavior. These agents would play the followers and leaders of contending factions at a local level. These ethno-political factions offer a corrupt "sim-city" type of world where one would convince various "crime" families to convert to legit operations or where the software can simulate insurgent operations at the local level. 
The government is looking for software that may include: (1)     Rich cognitive agents with a mind-body model built around well-regarded behavioral theories. Possible behavioral theories include but are not limited to Gibsonian ecological perception; physiology; integrated stress (Janis-Mann theory); cognitive appraisal theory (Ortony, Clore, Collins model); multi-attribute moralistic value systems based on personality instruments such as Hermann, UN Globe, and others; a social relations model that tracks relationship valences and strengths; and all of this organized within an Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop governing affective agent decision making.(2)     Represent social organization models including the leader and follower roles for agents to play in familial, religious, sectarian, commercial, and political groups and factions. This would be done by including models from well-regarded theories of social science concerning membership in groups, motivational congruence, mobilization such as in Hirshman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty theory; Eidelson's inventory of group perceptions; assessment of relative group power and vulnerability based on resource distributions; and a taxonomy of inter-group grievances dynamically updating itself as village or city interactions take place.(3)     Political economy models that can profile developing economies and a range of authoritarian to semi-democratic processes including tribal economics. These models could be based on Harod-Domar theory; the Solow exogenous growth model; institutional economy and public goods allocations based on the LRF model and theory; and various voting processes. Ideally, this capability would also include parameters for profiling institutions allocating public goods in terms of corruption, influence, and allocation schemes. (4)     Conversational agents where all actors in the simulation are enabled with a dialog engine such that they can expose a question tree and permit users to query them about their actions, why they did them, and about any or all of the parameters of the models mentioned above. Further, agents would act self-aware and capable of initiating conversations where they ask the user to help solve problems in their world.(5)     A unified model-driven framework for connecting above listed components into a single, interactive interface including the basic ability to incorporate population and cultural awareness training situations, ways to measure and gauge user performance, and coaching, feedback, and after action assessments.

STRUCTURE FOR RESPONSES:All interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing, complete information describing their ability to provide the software matching or similar to the above mentioned capabilities.
Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Only electronic submissions of information provided to the email address specified will be accepted. RFI responses should be sent to the following email address: Tonya.Lovelace@aqd.nbc.gov. All emails should include in the subject line the RFI number and the submitting organizations name.
To the extent possible, all responses should be unclassified and for general access by the Government and other evaluators working with the Government. All material provided (responses, discussions, questions/answers, and other data) that is not related to competition sensitive or contractor proprietary material may be provided (without attribution) to other respondents. Any material provided may be used in development of future solicitations. Any proprietary information submitted must be clearly and separately identified and marked and will be appropriately protected. The Government will NOT be responsible for any proprietary information not clearly marked.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<br /><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research to identify organizations capable of providing all necessary services to support the ongoing and expanded deployment of the SSA Access to Financial Institution (AFI) Project.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>SSA's eligibility rules require that an individual's liquid assets must be under a specified limit. Currently, there are over 7 million SSI recipients on the SSA rolls, and approximately 2 million individuals apply for SSI each year. In addition, SSA conducts periodic re-determinations of eligibility which include obtaining account balance information maintained by individual financial institutions (FI). The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 permits SSA to require SSI applicants and beneficiaries to provide authorization for access to their respective FI, in order to provide verification of their financial assets. In most states, SSA's current process for obtaining asset verification is paper-based. The form SSA-4641-U2, "Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Obtain Account Records From a Financial Institution and Request for Records", is mailed to the FI and asks the FI to provide account balance information over specified time periods. The purpose of the AFI is to convert to electronic media the information exchanges (e.g., form SSA-4641-U2) that now occur in paper form between FI and SSA; obtain titling, balance and related information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor in addition to verifying the account balance and interest income revealed by the applicant, recipient or deemor; detect unreported accounts in financial institutions located in proximity to the home address of the SSI applicant, recipient or deemor and to automate the process whereby FI are reimbursed for the cost of account verification. Interested parties must be able to deliver a web-based application that allows for the electronic transfer of account information between SSA and FI. The application would be used to verify eligibility for SSA's means-tested program, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. Background: Accuity, a SourceMedia Company, has previously created and deployed a web-based application that electronically transfers asset information between FI and SSA on a geographically-limited (i.e., California, New Jersey, and New York) basis since 2005. The current SSA AFI project successfully verifies financial information exchanges and detects undisclosed financial accounts to all 110 Field Offices (FO) in the states of New York and New Jersey and to a limited number of users in the Office of Quality Performance (OQP) 15 regional sites. SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services. To SSA's knowledge, Accuity is the only company that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers, name and social security number as the identifying information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Response Instructions:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>SSA is requesting any responsible organization that feels it has the capabilities and resources to meet the requirements listed within the</strong></em> <em><strong>Draft SOW to respond in writing</strong></em>. SSA is accepting questions, concerns, and /or suggestions related to the Draft SOW. Interested parties shall respond by email to <a href="mailto:traci.leach@ssa.gov">traci.leach@ssa.gov</a> no later than December 4, 2009. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned. All responses shall be marked AFI DRAFT SOW. The Government will not pay for, nor will it return, information provided in response to this notice. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses, or lack thereof, to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><strong>C.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p>Many countries in the Asia/Near East region, particularly those in the Middle East, face a looming water crisis that is a potential source of conflict between countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and inefficient use of water in agriculture are rapidly reducing water availability, and many countries face chronic water shortages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the ANE region, agriculture employs more than 50% of the labor force and consumes 85% of the available water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, decreasing availability of water threatens to constrain agricultural production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as urban areas grow, the demand for water resources is likely to increase, requiring shifts of water away from agriculture - a socially and politically sensitive issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoiding conflict and meeting basic human needs for water will require concerted action by governments, water users, donors, and the private sector working in partnership to transform water management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USAID has established a regional platform to serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) allows USAID to better use its regional resources, expertise, and support services for the seven USAID Missions in the MENA region, and serves as a way for USAID to address regional challenges present throughout the region.</p>

<a href="mailto:craig.e.anderson1@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). USAMRMC is Headquartered at Fort Detrick, Maryland, which supports six laboratories and seven organizations located throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Its mission is to provide medical knowledge and materiel lifecycle management to protect, treat and optimize Warfighter health and performance across the full spectrum of operations.  The Defense Medical Research and Development Program (DMRDP) is being initiated in fiscal year 2010 (FY10) to augment the related medical research and development programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The program is intended to discover and explore innovative approaches to protect, support, and advance the health and welfare of military personnel; to accelerate the transition of medical technologies into deployed products; and to accelerate the translation of advances in knowledge into new standards of care for injury prevention and treatment of casualties that can be applied in the field and clinic.  The DMRDP is posting this RFI/SS in order to: (1) identify candidate medical and supporting products that are highly relevant to the prevention and management of militarily relevant injuries and diseases arising in military personnel as a result of deployment and combat operations and are in need of additional development funding to meet requirements for commercialization and/or military acquisition and deployment; (2) identify organizations that have developed concepts for relevant human studies and possess appropriate scientific and/or medical expertise, experience, and resources to conduct studies that provide scientifically sound evidence to warrant broad adaptation of standards by the Department of Defense (DoD) and larger medical communities in areas of military need; (3) identify clinical trials with the potential to have a significant impact on prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and/or quality of life; and (4) obtain and acquire industry information on the availability of militarily relevant textiles, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and equipment items.<BR><BR>Note that this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No RFP is available and USAMRMC or USAMRAA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses must be identified with W23RYX1118RFI1, and are due no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on December 18, 2009.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be held confidential. Please submit responses to the attention of: USAMRMC RFI, ATTN: W23RYX1118RFI1, USAMRAA, 820 Chandler St., Fort Detrick, MD 21702. Requested submissions must be e-mailed to craig.e.anderson@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONRegional Contracting Office - Far East MCB Camp S.D. Butler, Okinawa Japan
1.0   Description
1.1  The USMC Regional Contracting Office Far, East (RCO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Consolidated Public Affairs Office (CPAO), in seeking information from prospective publishers interested in publishing the Marine Corps Base Camp Butler quarterly bi-lingual magazine Big Circle as a commercial enterprise (CE) publication. Any information/suggestions that may improve the quality of the upcoming solicitation is appreciated.  
1.2   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Data submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. Information is being requested in order to make potential future requirements better for industry and the Government. 
2.0  Statement of Objectives
2.1 PURPOSE: 
The CPAO desires to convert our Big Circle magazine from an appropriated fund publication (without advertising) to a commercial enterprise (CE) publication (with advertising) for the express purpose of increasing readership and circulation.  The magazine is bilingual and intended exclusively for Japanese readers.  Text is in English and Kanji.  The magazine is currently 24 pages, including front and back covers.  The magazine is currently printed four times a year with an average of 8,250 copies per issue.  The magazine is distributed on Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler to Japanese employees.  During the annual camp festivals on Okinawa as well as other community relations events, the magazine is provided to visitors.  In addition, the magazine is published online (http://www.okinawa.usmc.mil/BigCircle/ BigCircle.html) and readers subscribe to an on-line distribution list.  Once the magazine is posted to the internet the CPAO notifies readers by e-mail that the magazine is available online.  For each issue, nearly 4,000 copies are mailed to nearly 1,300 different addresses in Japan, to includes schools, businesses, government offices, civic organizations, business and civic leaders, hospitals, libraries, media agencies, and JSDF units, for example.  Some addresses receive only one copy while other addresses receive multiple copies.  CPAO desires to contract with a commercial publisher to sell advertising for inclusion in the magazine, print the magazine, and grow the distribution to Japanese audience.  Editorial content would be controlled and produced by CPAO while all advertising space would be managed by the publisher.  Circulation totals and publication frequency could be adjusted by publisher based upon publisher's success at increasing the magazine's readership. This contract would be at NO COST to the U.S. government and the magazine must be circulated FREE of charge to general public.  Any and all profits generated by the sale of advertising for the magazine would be the publisher to keep.   All interested parties shall submit their company profile and any pertinent information that would be useful in assisting the Government on any future solicitation that may result from this RFI. 
3.0 Summary
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources interested in contracting with the U.S. Government to manage the marketing, advertising sales, printing, and distribution of Big Circle magazine. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  The U.S. Marine Corps has not made a commitment to contract any services, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
Note: This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure services or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under its Enhanced-Use Leasing (EUL) authority (38 U.S.C.  8161 - 8169), is seeking "expressions of interest" from bidders interested in a development opportunity to provide irrigation water to the Riverside National Cemetery in exchange for approximately 40 acres of available unimproved land.  This will be accomplished through a long-term out-lease of a currently underutilized 40 acre parcel of VA land located on the southeast corner of campus adjacent to the Western Municipal Water  District treatment plant to be used as a detention pond to accommodate run off water flows from the community.Through this EUL authority, VA can offer a long-term use of assets (up to 75 years) in order to accommodate the scope of the project.  In return for VA's outleasing of the property, the developer/lessee would be solely responsible for providing irrigation water to the Riverside National Cemetery. BACKGROUNDRiverside National Cemetery is the third-largest cemetery managed by the National Cemetery Administration, and since 2000 has been the most active in the system based on the number of interments. It was established in 1976 through the transfer of 740 acres from March Air Force Base, which during World War II was called the U.S. Army's Camp William G. Haan. The cemetery was dedicated and opened for burials Nov. 11, 1978. An additional 181 acres was transferred by the Air Force in 2003.  The dramatic, meandering landscape features a central boulevard with memorial circles, lakes, indigenous-styled committal shelters, and a memorial amphitheater.SPONSOR/APPLICANT ELIGIBILITYVA is seeking qualified entity capable of providing water to the Riverside National Cemetery.LOCATION OF PROPERTYThe 40 acre underutilized (vacant) parcel is in the southeastern part of the Riverside National Cemetery adjacent to the Western al District treatment plant. .CONTACT AND DEADLINE TO REPLYIf your organization is interested and capable of executing all aspects of the project, please  EMAIL a brief expression of interest to Jay. Halpern @ va.gov and cc a copy to the Contracting Officer maina.gakure@va.gov.

<SUBJECT>--Questions/Answers
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:alexanpa@id.doe.gov">Alexander-Johnson, Patricia</a>
<DESC>Q: If multiple ID/IQ contract awards are granted, will all awardees have the same scope of services?
A: Yes, but individual task orders issued under the basic or master contract may be different to a specific awardee (so long as the task order scope falls within the scope of the master contract).
Q: Will subsequent tasks issued under these contracts be competitively bid among the awardees?
A: Yes, individual tasks with an estimated value >$3M will normally be competed IAW FAR 16.505, as well as IAW any specific ordering procedures specified in the contract.  Provision is made to not compete orders as well when specific statutory exceptions apply , e.g., the agency need for the  services is so urgent that providing for such competition would result in unacceptable delays; only one awardee is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique or highly specialized, etc. 
Q: Must the offerors/awardees have an office in Idaho Falls, ID and/or the metropolitan Washington DC area?
A: No, unless such a need is specifically and legitimately called for to perform successfully on an individual order(s).
Q: What is the budget for the requested services? Will there be a minimum award to successful awardees?
A:  This information will be available in the Request for Proposal.  There is no specific "budget" for the basic or master contract; the basic contract will be a contract for services that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the performance of tasks during the period of the contract.  Each contract will specify a guaranteed minimum quantity; this amount must be more than a nominal quantity; the Government?s obligation under each basic contract is limited to this minimum quantity specified.  Each contract will also specify a maximum quantity that can be ordered both on a specific order basis, as well as an overall maximum that can be ordered against the basic over the life of the basic contract.  The "budgets" or amounts for individual orders shall be specified on each order issued.
Q: Can you please confirm that under the terms of (FAR) Part 15, universities, colleges, and national laboratories and their Maintenance and Operations (M&O) contractors could be considered as subcontractors to a team to support this opportunity?  A: It is acceptable to utilize universities, colleges, and national laboratories and their Maintenance and Operations (M&O) contractors as teaming partners for this opportunity? 
Q:  Is it allowable to submit questions for this Presolicitation through the email address listed in the presolicitation notice?
A:  Yes; however after today (November 18, 2009), questions related to the presolicitation notice will not be accepted.

<ARCHDATE>01172011
<CONTACT>Mark I. Heiligman, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-10-02@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Quantum Computer Science (QCS) Program on December 17, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 10:00am to 5:00pm in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the QCS Program, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />Quantum computing holds great promise for solving important classically intractable computational problems. Ongoing work in theoretical and experimental physics continues to make advances in a number of technologies that might one day underlay a quantum information processor. Relatively little investment has been made in exploring the computer science side of quantum information science (QIS) even though the challenges that quantum computing poses to the world of computer science are on a par with the challenges posed to the world of physics.</p>
<p>The IARPA Quantum Computer Science (QCS) Program will be centered on questions relating to the computational resources required to run quantum algorithms on realistic quantum computers. Both the complete estimation of required resources and their optimization will be the focus of this program. This program naturally breaks up into three core technical areas: quantum algorithm implementation, quantum error correction, and quantum optimal control. A quantum computing toolbox to study these problems will need to contain such things as quantum programming environments, as well as tools for generating, analyzing and optimally selecting quantum error correction and control protocols. This set of tools will serve the goal of measuring and improving the overhead of error correction and control and as a means of programming complex quantum algorithms of a realistic size.</p>
<p>Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with expertise in such fields as compilers and high-level language development, automated design tools, error correcting codes, control theory, algorithms, computer design, quantum physics, and software development, among others. IARPA anticipates that based on the compelling strength of the self-selected teams, universities and companies from around the world will participate in advancing the state of the art in this area. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, peer reviewed academic journals.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST Friday, December 11, 2009 at https://conference.brtrc.com/QCS_pd/registration.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification to enter the conference.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present organization capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present will be visible on the posters/presentations tab after registering for the conference. Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be limited to the first 15 registered respondents with approved presentations, and the first 40 registered respondents with approved posters. Presentations to the Government to solicit feedback are not intended, and Government personnel will not be present during these sessions.</p>

Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to construct loaner life jacket stations in six campgrounds and one day use area.  The work will include using treated lumber and timbers to construct a bulletin board-like structure with a metal roof upon which park attendants will hang personal flotation devices of varying sizes for loan to the public.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis. The Global Hawk Systems Group, Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Aeronautical Systems Center, anticipates the continued procurement of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) assets through fiscal year 2014. Requirements for these procurements include, but are not limited to, Global Hawk Air Vehicles (AV), Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suites (EISS), Airborne Signals Intelligence Payloads (ASIP), Multi-Platform RADAR Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP)Payloads, engineering updates, configuration management, flight test demonstrations, systems integration, and support segments. These components comprise the Global Hawk System.
It is the Government's intent to release a solicitation for these requirements on a Sole Source basis IAW FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source" being Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, located at 17066 Goldentop Road, Rancho Bernardo, CA, CAGE Code 78022. *Subcontracting possibilities do exist. The proposed effort involves work classified at the SECRET level with the potential to go to higher levels.
For planning purposes, the Government contemplates a Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract arrangement for ASIP and MP-RTIP payloads, and a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract arrangement for AVs, EISS, and all other Lot 10 components.  These contracts will commence in March 2011, however, the Advance Procurement for the Long Lead items is slated to commence in December 2009 (this synopsis is strictly for subcontracting opportunities).
Interested firms must possess capabilities to meet the following criteria: 
-ability to manufacture, integrate and test the Global Hawk UAV with related ground segment, 
-ensure the AV sensor suites for the Global Hawk interact through secure BLOS or LOS data links including the receipt of airborne system health status, 
-demonstrate efficient subcontractor and vendor product acquisition management including working with other Government communications and sensors,
-possess experience in interacting with Government acquisition program offices, 
-ability to obtain a U.S. SECRET level security clearance, and 
-provide a secure facility for the development and production of all Global Hawk systems components including Automated Information Systems. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Mr. Joe San Filippo, Material Program Manager at Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation. (858)618-4359. 
GLOBAL HAWK is an Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program.

<DESC>Description:<br />The OC-ALC, Department of the Air Force, proposes to rent aircraft hangar space from the MROTC Facility operated by the Boeing Company located on Douglas Boulevard east of Tinker AFB. The Government intends to procure this commercial service using a sole-source contract supported by a J&amp;A citing FAR subpart 6.320-1(a)(2)(B). The government currently has a short-term need to rent aircraft hangar space for 321 days. The Government will need to rent all three hangers.&nbsp;The contracting officer believes a FAR Part 12, Acquisition of commercial Items, severable service contract will satisfy the government's present needs. IV.STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This procurement may fail under the Federal Management Regulation 102-73.155 as a Categorical space delegation. Only one property, the MROTC, is able to satisfy 76 AMXG's needs as described in section IV which are essentially to support weapon system requirements without jeopardizing the individual weapon system PDM efforts. The MROTC is the only facility with sufficient high Bay space, proximity to the base, and has the industrial infrastructure to meet 76 AMXG's requirements.<br />

<DESC>This requirment is to be issued for use by the  Radiology & imaging Sciences Department  at the National Institutes of Health. 

The Stat Sensor screening instrument for serum and creatinine and eGFR will enable the Radiology department to determine if a patient able to receive intraveneous contrast within 30 seconds. This will greatly impact the reduction in wait time for multiple diagnostic studies scheduled.

This product is is required to allow for quick screening of patients with a small fingerstick capillary blood measurement producing results within 30 seconds. This test is for screening purposes only and will not be considered as a diagnostic test.

Presently this type of point care testing is unique from other hand held devices in that it only tests creatinine and calculates eGFR. Other devices of this type require a venous/arterial specimen, longer wait time for results, or produce multiple test results that are not useful in this setting.

The known manufacture for this product is NovaBiomedical, Waltham,MA

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the camera copy and furnished materials is an integral part of</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these specifications. No additional payment will be allowed, due the contractor&rsquo;s failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">PRESS INSPECTION:<span>&nbsp; </span><span style="color: black;">Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor&rsquo;s printing facility for quality conformance.

Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000&deg; kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Subcontractor and any lower-tiered subcontractors shall be held accountable to conduct their activities in accordance with the Contractor's Worker Safety and Health Program while working in or within Contractor or DOE-owned or leased facilities (see Clause 13 below).</p>
<p>The Subcontractor and lower-tiered subcontractors retain the option to work to their company-specific Worker Safety and Health Programs provided those programs have been pre-approved by the Contractor and are equivalent to or more stringent than the Contractor's program.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor and any lower-tiered subcontractors have the authority and responsibility to suspend or stop work should any hazardous condition arise that is not addressed by the Contractor's Worker Safety and Health Program.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor's obligations under the Special Provision titled "Indemnity" (See Clause 17 below) apply to liability arising in connection with or incidental to Subcontractor's performance or failure to perform, as provided in this Special Provision.</p>

In any instance where an accident/incident occurs on the job-site due to the fault or negligence of the Subcontractor, the Subcontractor will not be paid for any associated downtime. In addition, the Subcontractor shall be responsible for the cost of required investigations and corrective actions.</p>
<p>13. WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAM</p>
<p>The Contractor conducts all work activities in accordance with its Worker Safety and Health Program (WSHP), which incorporates the requirements of 10 CFR 851, Worker Safety and Health Program, an Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) as specified in 48 CFR 970-5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, and other applicable regulations, standards and codes as applied by contract.</p>
<p>The principles of the WSHP that guide the safe execution of work are:</p>
<p>1. Line management is responsible for the protection of employees, the public, and the environment. Line management includes those Subcontractor and lower-tier subcontractor employees managing or supervising employees performing work.</p>
<p>2. Clear and unambiguous lines of authority and responsibility for ensuring ES&amp;H are established and maintained at all organizational levels, including for the workers.</p>
<p>3. Personnel possess the experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are necessary to discharge their responsibilities.</p>
<p>4. Resources are effectively allocated to address ES&amp;H programmatic and operational considerations. Protecting employees, the public, and the environment is a priority whenever activities are planned and performed.</p>
<p>5. Before work is performed, the associated hazards are identified, evaluated, and an agree-upon set of controls and requirements are established which, if properly implemented, provide adequate assurance that employees, the public, and the environment are protected from adverse consequences. Workers are to be actively involved in the work planning process.</p>
<p>6. Administrative and engineering controls to prevent and mitigate hazards are tailored to the work being performed and associated hazards. Emphasis should be on designing the work and/or controls to reduce or eliminate the hazards and to prevent accidents and unplanned releases and exposures.</p>
<p>7. The conditions and requirements to be satisfied for work to begin and conducted are agreed-upon. The extent of documentation and the level of approving authority for agreement shall be tailored to the complexity and hazards associated with the work.</p>
<p><br />For work under this Subcontract, job-specific work instructions will be developed through the Contractor's work planning and control process. This process controls all aspects of the work being conducted and integrates planning to include involvement of multiple organizations and workers. The Work Planning and Control Process safety core functions include:</p>
<p>1. Define the scope of work.<br />Identification of all work to be performed and the associated steps to complete work.</p>
<p>2. Identify and analyze the hazards associated with the work<br />Completion of a hazard analysis for each step in the work process, which is to be a joint effort between management and the workers performing the work.</p>
<p>3. Develop and implement hazard controls<br />Hazard controls should first concentrate on elimination of the identified hazard; if elimination is not possible, then reasonable controls are identified to mitigate the hazard.</p>
<p>4. Perform work within controls<br />No work is to be performed until all identified controls are in place. Workers at all levels are to be informed of the work scope, potential hazards, hazard controls, and job responsibilities before Work begins. No Work is to be performed outside the work planning documents.</p>
<p>5. Provide feedback on adequacy of control and continue to improve safety management.<br />Feedback is an integral part of process improvement and shall be encouraged at all times and from all levels of the project organization, especially the workers. Controls should be adjusted based on lessons learned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In performing work under this Subcontract, the Subcontractor, its workers, and its lower-tier subcontractors shall:</p>
<p>1. Perform work safely, in a manner that ensures adequate protection for employees, the public, and the environment.</p>
<p>2. Participate in the preparation of job-specific work instructions by integrating into the Contractor's Work control process (usually accomplished during pre-job safety briefings)</p>
<p>3. Acknowledge understanding of and concurrence with job-specific work instructions prior to performing any Work.</p>
<p>4. Perform work in accordance with job-specific Work instructions.</p>
<p>5. Suspend/Stop work if conditions or hazards arise that are outside the scope of job-specific work instructions.</p>
<p>6. Provide feedback to the Contractor on the adequacy of work instructions and controls.</p>
<p>In accordance with Contractor flow down requirements of the U.S. Department of Energy with regard to Title 10 CFR 851, Worker Safety and Health Program, Subcontractor must comply with the following safety and health standards that are applicable to the hazards at their covered workplace. Nothing in this part must be construed as relieving Subcontractor from complying with any additional specific safety and health requirement that it determines to be necessary to protect the safety and health of workers.</p>
<p>1. Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 850, "Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program."</p>
<p>2. Title 29 CFR, Parts 1904.4 through 1904.11, 1904.29 through 1904.33; 1904.44, and 1904.46, "Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illnesses."</p>

The Subcontractor shall ensure that all pressure vessels, boilers, air receivers, and supporting piping systems conform to:</p>
<p>1. The applicable American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (2004); sections I through section XII including applicable Code Cases.</p>
<p>2. The applicable ASME B31 (Code for Pressure Piping) standards as indicated below; and or as indicated in reference sources herein:</p>
<p>(a) B31.1-2001-Power Piping, and B31.1a-2002-Addenda to ASME B31.1-2001 <br />(b) B31.2-1968-Fuel Gas Piping<br />(c) B31.3-2002-Process Piping<br />(d) B31.4-2002-Pipeline Transportation Systems for Liquid Hydrocarbons and Other Liquids <br />(e) B31.5-2001-Refrigeration Piping and Heat Transfer Components, and B31.5a-2004, Addenda to ASME B31.5-2001<br />(f) B31.8-2003-Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems<br />(g) B31.8S-2001-Managing System Integrity of Gas Pipelines<br />(h) B31.9-1996-Building Services Piping <br />(i) B31.11-2002-Slurry Transportation Piping Systems <br />(j) B31G-1991-Manual for Determining Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines.</p>
<p>3. The strictest applicable state and local codes.</p>
<p>When national consensus codes are not applicable (because of pressure range, vessel geometry, use of special materials, etc.), Subcontractor must implement measures to provide equivalent protection and ensure a level of safety greater than or equal to the level of protection afforded by the ASME or applicable state or local code. Measures must include the following:</p>
<p>1. Design drawings, sketches, and calculations must be reviewed and approved by a qualified independent design professional (i.e., professional engineer). Documented organizational peer review is acceptable.</p>
<p>2. Qualified personnel must be used to perform examinations and inspections of materials, in-process fabrications, nondestructive tests, and acceptance test.</p>
<p>3. Documentation, traceability, and accountability must be maintained for each pressure vessel or system, including descriptions of design, pressure conditions, testing, inspection, operation, repair, and maintenance.</p>
<p>4. Copies of such documentation shall be provided to the Contractor upon request.</p>
<p>14. INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Subcontractor shall, at its expense, maintain in effect at all times during the performance of the Work insurance coverage with limits not less than those set forth below and with insurers and under forms of policies satisfactory to Contractor (NNES must be named as an additional on the Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Policy):</p>
<p>A. Workers' Compensation as required by any applicable law or regulation.<br />If there is an exposure of injury to Subcontractor's employees under the U.S. Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Jones Act or under laws, regulations or statutes applicable to maritime employees, coverage shall be included for such injuries or claims.<br />B. Employer's Liability of not less than $500,000 each accident.<br />C.

Any claim by the Subcontractor for an adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing within 30 days from the date of receipt by the Subcontractor of the notification of change; provided, however, that the Contractor, if it is determined that the facts justify such action, may receive and act upon any such claim asserted at any time prior to final payment under this Subcontract.

<p>22. HOLD HARMLESS (RESERVED)</p>
<p>23. AVAILABILITY AND LIMITATION OF FUNDS</p>
<p>The Contractor's obligation for performance of this Subcontract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for Subcontract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Contractor for any payment in excess of the amount presently available and obligated may arise for performance under this Subcontract until sufficient additional funds are obligated to this Subcontract. The Contractor shall endeavor to give this Subcontract a high priority within its appropriated funds for each year of performance, provided, however, that nothing in this Subcontract shall be considered to bind or otherwise obligate the Contractor to provide additional funds.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor shall notify the Contractor's APR in writing whenever it has reason to believe that payments due within the next 60 days from the Contractor under this Subcontract, when added to all payments previously made, will reach 75 percent of the Subcontract funding. The Subcontractor's written notice shall specifically identify the payments made to date and the nature and amount of expected or anticipated payments that would result in payments that exceed the amount obligated.</p>
<p>The Subcontractor is not obligated to continue Subcontract performance that would result in payment obligations on the part of the Contractor in excess of the amount obligated. In the event the Subcontractor continues Subcontract performance, it does so at its own risk. If the Subcontractor continues performance and the Contractor subsequently obligates sufficient additional funds to the Subcontract, the Subcontractor may invoice for items delivered in accordance with applicable clauses to the same extent as if such work had been completed after such additional funds had been obligated.</p>
<p>In the event that additional funding is not made available to the Contractor, the Contractor may (1) suspend performance in accordance with the clause titled "Suspension" or (2) terminate the Subcontract for convenience in accordance with the Clause titled "Termination."</p>
<p>24. GOVERNMENT CLAUSES</p>

Neither such notice nor CONTRACTOR'S failure to issue such notice shall relieve SUBCONTRACTOR of its obligation to achieve the quality of Work and rate of progress required by this Subcontract.</p>
<p>Failure of SUBCONTRACTOR to comply with CONTRACTOR'S instructions may be grounds for determination by CONTRACTOR that SUBCONTRACTOR is not prosecuting the Work with such diligence as will assure completion within the times specified.

When such a process is used, the set of tailored ES&amp;H requirements, as approved by DOE pursuant to the process, shall be incorporated into the Subcontract with full force and effect.

If SUBCONTRACTOR does not cure such failure within seven (7) calendar days from receipt of notification, or sooner as required by CONTRACTOR if safety to persons is involved, or fails to provide satisfactory evidence that such default will be corrected within a reasonable time, CONTRACTOR may, by written notice to SUBCONTRACTOR and without notice to SUBCONTRACTOR'S sureties, if any, terminate in whole or in part SUBCONTRACTOR'S right to proceed with the Work and CONTRACTOR may prosecute the Work to completion by contract or by any other method deemed expedient. CONTRACTOR may take possession of and utilize any data, designs, licenses, equipment, materials, plant, tools, and property of any kind furnished by SUBCONTRACTOR and necessary to complete the Work.<br />SUBCONTRACTOR and its sureties, if any, shall be liable for all costs in excess of the Subcontract price for such terminated work reasonably and necessarily incurred in the completion of the Work as scheduled, including cost of administration of any purchase order or subcontract awarded to others for completion.<br />Upon termination for default, SUBCONTRACTOR shall:<br />(a) Immediately discontinue work on the date and to the extent specified in the notice and place no further purchase orders or subcontracts to the extent that they relate to the performance of the terminated work;<br />(b) Inventory, maintain, and turn over the CONTRACTOR all data, designs, licenses, equipment, materials, plant, tools, and property furnished by SUBCONTRACTOR or provided by CONTRACTOR for performance of the terminated work;<br />(c) Promptly obtain cancellation upon terms satisfactory to CONTRACTOR of all purchase orders, subcontracts, rentals, or any other agreements existing for performance of the terminated work or assign those agreements as directed by CONTRACTOR;</p>
<p>(d) Cooperate with the CONTRACTOR in transfer of data, designs, licenses and information and disposition of work in progress so as to mitigate damages;<br />(e) Comply with other reasonable requests from CONTRACTOR regarding the terminated work; and<br />(f) Continue to perform in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Subcontract of such portion of the Work that is not terminated.<br />If, after termination pursuant to this clause, it is determined for any reason that SUBCONTRACTOR was not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to the General Provision clause titled "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE."</p>
<p>GP-24 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR may, at its option, terminate for convenience any of the Work under this Subcontract in whole or, from time to time, in part, at any time by written notice to SUBCONTRACTOR. Such notice shall specify the extent to which the performance of the Work is terminated and the effective date of such termination. Upon receipt of such notice SUBCONTRACTOR shall:<br />(a) Immediately discontinue the Work on the date and to the extent specified in the notice and place no further purchase orders or subcontracts for materials, services, or facilities, other than as may be required for completion of such portion of the Work that is not terminated.<br />(b) Promptly obtain assignment or cancellation upon terms satisfactory to CONTRACTOR of all purchase orders, subcontracts, rentals, or any other agreements existing for the performance of the terminated work or assign those agreements directed by CONTRACTOR;<br />(c) Assist CONTRACTOR in the maintenance, protection, and disposition of work in progress, plant, tools, equipment, property, and materials acquired by SUBCONTRACTOR or furnished by CONTRACTOR under this Subcontract; and<br />(d) Complete performance of such portion of the Work that is not terminated.</p>
<p>Upon any such termination, SUBCONTRACTOR hereby waives any claims for damages, including loss of anticipated profits; on account thereof, but as the sole right and remedy of SUBCONTRACTOR, CONTRACTOR shall pay in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>(a) The subcontract price corresponding to the work performed in accordance with this Subcontract before such notice of termination;<br />(b) All reasonable costs for work thereafter performed, as specified in such notice;<br />(c) Reasonable administrative costs of settling and paying claims arising from terminating work under purchase orders or subcontracts;<br />(d) Reasonable costs incurred in demobilization and the disposition of residual material, plant, and equipment; and<br />(e) A reasonable overhead and profit on items (a) through (e) of this clause.<br />SUBCONTRACTOR shall submit within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of notice of termination, a written statement setting forth its proposal for an adjustment to the subcontract price to include only the incurred costs described in this clause. CONTRACTOR shall review, analyze, and verify such proposal, and negotiate an equitable adjustment, and the Subcontract shall be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>GP-25 CHANGES:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR may at any time, by written order and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this Subcontract. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of or the time required for performance of any part of the Work under this Subcontract, CONTRACTOR shall, subject to the requirements below, make an equitable adjustment in the Subcontract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the Subcontract.<br /><br />SUBCONTRACTOR must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause in writing within 10 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if CONTRACTOR decides that the facts justify it, CONTRACTOR may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the Subcontract.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR must submit a proposal for equitable adjustment in accordance with the General Provision entitled "EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT" within 20 days of the written assertion in the above paragraph. If SUBCONTRACTOR'S proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, CONTRACTOR shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.</p>
<p>Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the General Provision entitled "DISPUTES." However, nothing in this clause shall excuse SUBCONTRACTOR from proceeding with the Subcontract as changed.</p>
<p>Any other written or oral order (which as used in this paragraph includes direction, instruction, interpretation, or determination) from CONTRACTOR that SUBCONTRACTOR alleges causes a change may be treated as a change order under this clause, provided that SUBCONTRACTOR gives CONTRACTOR written notice within 5 days of the action stating (1) the date, circumstances, and source of the order and (2) that SUBCONTRACTOR regards the order as a change. SUBCONTRACTOR must submit a proposal for equitable adjustment in accordance with the General Provision entitled "EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT" within 20 days of the written notice.</p>
<p>GP-26 DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS:</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall promptly notify CONTRACTOR in writing before proceeding with any Work that SUBCONTRACTOR believes to involve a differing site condition with respect to subsurface or latent physical conditions at the Site differing materially from those indicated in the Subcontract, or previously unknown physical conditions at the Site of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in this Subcontract.</p>
<p>Nothing in this clause shall excuse SUBCONTRACTOR from proceeding with any other Work under the Subcontract not directly associated with the condition subject to this notice.</p>
<p>The notification must be specific in its description of the differing site condition. CONTRACTOR will, as promptly as practicable, investigate such conditions and notify SUBCONTRACTOR in writing of its determination. If it is determined that such condition do materially so differ and cause an increase or decrease in SUBCONTRACTOR'S cost of or the time required for performance of the Work under the Subcontract, an adjustment will be made and the Subcontract modified in writing accordingly. However, in no way shall such determination constitute an acknowledgment that any other differing site conditions may exist.</p>
<p>No claim of SUBCONTRACTOR under this clause will be allowed unless SUBCONTRACTOR has promptly given the required notice and asserted its right for an adjustment by submission of a Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA) in the form of a proposal and estimate within thirty (30) days after receipt of CONTRACTOR'S written determination of a differing site condition in accordance with the General Provision entitled "EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT." Failure to agree to the existence of a differing site condition or any adjustment shall be a dispute under the General Provision entitled "DISPUTES."</p>
<p>GP-27 EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT:</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, and SUBCONTRACTOR' Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA) must be submitted to CONTRACTOR within the schedule prescribed in the General Provision entitled "CHANGES", and/or the General Provision entitled "DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS", and/or the schedule prescribed in the General Provision entitled "GOVERNMENT PROPERTY," as applicable. An adjustment in the price cannot be made until such time as SUBCONTRACTOR'S REA has been submitted to and accepted by CONTRACTOR, and negotiations have been completed.</p>
<p>A. The REA shall provide both a firm-fixed-price proposal and narrative which, at a minimum, addresses the following items:</p>
<p>1. Line items that have been or may be affected;</p>
<p>2. Labor or materials or both that have been or may be added, deleted, or made obsolete;</p>
<p>3. Delays and disruptions in the manner and sequence of performance and the effect on continued performance that have been or may be encountered;</p>
<p>4. An estimate of adjustments to Subcontract price, delivery schedule, and other provisions that are affected;</p>
<p>5. SUBCONTRACTOR'S costs incurred to date; and</p>
<p>6. An estimate of the time and costs required completing the Work affected.</p>
<p>The narrative must be in a format to enable an independent third party to review and understand the proposal. Pricing and/or cost data shall be supplied in a manner and level requested by CONTRACTOR to support the fixed-price proposal. SUBCONTRACTOR subsequently shall not be entitled to increase the value of the REA to address elements of cost or impact that were not included with the REA.</p>
<p>B. An equitable adjustment in the schedule and/or Subcontract price will be allowed only if: (1) SUBCONTRACTOR has complied with the requirements of the General Provisions entitled "CHANGES," "DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS," and/or "GOVERNMENT PROPERTY," as applicable; and (2) the REA was submitted within the time allotted. SUBCONTRACTOR shall waive its right for adjustment if it fails to comply with the instructions provided herein.</p>
<p>GP-28 SUSPENSION OF WORK:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR may at any time by written notice require SUBCONTRACTOR to suspend, delay, or interrupt all or any portion of the Work under this Subcontract for a period of up to 90-days after the notice to suspend Work is delivered to SUBCONTRACTOR, or for any other period to which the Parties may agree. Upon receipt of the notice, SUBCONTRACTOR shall immediately comply with its provisions and take all reasonable steps, as directed by CONTRACTOR'S Procurement Representative, to minimize the incurrence of cost associated with the suspension. Prior to the expiration of the suspension notice, CONTRACTOR shall either: (1) cancel or extend the notice or (2) terminate for convenience the Work covered by the notice as provided in the General Provision entitled "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE." If the suspension notice is cancelled or allowed to expire, SUBCONTRACTOR shall resume Work. The General Provision entitled "CHANGES" shall govern any requested adjustment by SUBCONTRACTOR resulting from a suspension of Work notice.<br /><br />GP-29 NONDISCLOSURE:</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in this Subcontract or by statutory requirement, SUBCONTRACTOR agrees not to divulge to third parties (excluding lower tier subcontractors or suppliers with a need to know and who first execute a nondisclosure agreement), without the written consent of CONTRACTOR, any information (including but not limited to data, photographs, sketches, and advertising) obtained from or through CONTRACTOR in connection with the performance of this Subcontract.</p>
<p>If so requested by CONTRACTOR, SUBCONTRACTOR further agrees to require its Employees to execute a nondisclosure agreement prior to performing any Work under this Subcontract. Further, if so requested by CONTRACTOR, SUBCONTRACTOR agreed to execute and to require its employees and subcontractors to execute, a DOE-approved agreement with any party whose facilities or proprietary data it is given access to or is furnished, restricting use and disclosure of the date or the information obtained from the facilities.</p>
<p>GP-30 PUBLICITY AND ADVERTISING:</p>

SUBCONTRACTOR shall include the application for and implementation of all permits and licenses in its schedules and identify as schedule milestones all permit-required inspections and approvals.</p>
<p>GP-33 SUBCONTRACT INTERPRETATION:</p>
<p>All questions concerning interpretation or clarification of this Subcontract or applicable standards and codes, including the discovery of conflicts, discrepancies, errors and omissions, or the acceptable performance thereof by SUBCONTRACTOR shall be immediately submitted in writing to CONTRACTOR for resolution. Subject to the provisions of the General Provision entitled "CHANGES," all determinations, instructions, and clarifications of CONTRACTOR shall be final and conclusive unless determined to have been fraudulent or capricious, or arbitrary, or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or not supported by substantial evidence. At all times SUBCONTRACTOR shall proceed with the Work in accordance with the determinations, instructions, and clarifications of CONTRACTOR. SUBCONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible for requesting instructions or interpretations and shall be solely liable for any costs and expenses arising from its failure to do so. Changes accepted and performed by SUBCONTRACTOR personnel outside of the Subcontract without written authorization from CONTRACTOR shall be the responsibility of SUBCONTRACTOR.</p>
<p>GP-34 STANDARDS AND CODES:</p>
<p>Wherever references are made in this Subcontract to standards or codes in accordance with which the Work under this Subcontract is to be performed, the edition or revision of the standards or codes current on the effective date of this Subcontract shall apply, unless otherwise expressly stated. In case of conflict between any referenced standards and codes and any Subcontract document, the Subcontract documents shall govern.</p>
<p>GP-35 TAXES:</p>
<p>The Subcontract price shall be exclusive of any federal, state or local sales, use, or excise taxes, levied upon, or measured by the sale, the sales price, or use of goods in connection with the Work under this Subcontract. SUBCONTRACTOR shall list separately on each invoice or voucher any such tax lawfully applicable to such goods and payable by CONTRACTOR with respect to which CONTRACTOR does not furnish to SUBCONTRACTOR lawful evidence of exemption. SUBCONTRACTOR shall comply with any reasonable request by CONTRACTOR regarding payments under protest, and regarding any refunds, claims litigation or proceedings with respect to any such taxes and shall make appropriate adjustments to afford CONTRACTOR the benefit of any refund or reduction in such taxes.</p>
<p><br />GP-36 WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAM: (RESERVED)</p>
<p><br />GP-37 FINAL INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:</p>
<p>When SUBCONTRACTOR considers the Work or any CONTRACTOR-identified independent portion of the Work under this Subcontract to be complete and ready for acceptance, SUBCONTRACTOR shall notify CONTRACTOR in writing. CONTRACTOR, with SUBCONTRACTOR'S cooperation, will conduct such reviews, inspections, and tests as may be reasonably required to satisfy CONTRACTOR that the Work or identified portion of the Work conforms to all requirements of the Subcontract. If all or any part of the Work covered by SUBCONTRACTOR'S notice does not conform to Subcontract requirements, CONTRACTOR shall notify SUBCONTRACTOR of such nonconformance, and SUBCONTRACTOR shall take corrective action and then have the nonconforming Work re-inspected until all requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />GP-38 BACK-CHARGE WORK:</p>
<p>If, under the provisions of this Subcontract, SUBCONTRACTOR is notified by CONTRACTOR to correct defective or nonconforming Work, and SUBCONTRACTOR states or by its actions indicates that it is unable or unwilling to proceed with corrective action in a reasonable time, CONTRACTOR may, upon written notice, proceed to accomplish the redesign, repair, rework, or replacement of nonconforming Work by the most expeditious means available and back-charge SUBCONTRACTOR for the costs incurred. Furthermore, if CONTRACTOR agrees to or is required to perform Work for SUBCONTRACTOR, such as cleanup, off-loading, or completion of incomplete Work, CONTRACTOR may, upon written notice, perform such Work by the most expeditious means available and back-charge SUBCONTRACTOR for the costs incurred.</p>
<p>The cost of back-charge Work shall include:</p>
<p>A. Incurred labor costs including all payroll additives;</p>
<p>B. Incurred net delivered material costs;</p>
<p>C. Incurred lower-tier supplier and subcontractor costs directly related to performing the corrective action;</p>
<p>D. Equipment and tool rentals at prevailing rates in the Jobsite area; and</p>
<p>E. A multiplier that will be applied to the total of Items A through D for CONTRACTOR'S overhead, supervision and administrative costs. This multiplier will be based on CONTRACTOR'S established rates.</p>
<p>The back-charge notice will request SUBCONTRACTOR'S concurrence for CONTRACTOR to proceed with the required Work. However, failure of SUBCONTRACTOR to grant such concurrence shall not impair CONTRACTOR'S right to proceed with Work under this or any other provision of this Subcontract.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR shall separately invoice or deduct from payments otherwise due to SUBCONTRACTOR the costs as provided herein. CONTRACTOR'S right to back-charge is in addition to any and all other rights and remedies provided in this Subcontract or by law. The performance of back-charge Work by CONTRACTOR shall not relieve SUBCONTRACTOR of any of its responsibilities under this Subcontract, including but not limited to express or implied warranties, specified standards for quality, contractual liabilities and indemnification, and meeting the Subcontract Milestones of the Special Provision entitled "COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION, and AND COMPLETION OF THE WORK." <br /><br />GP-39 SITE CONDITIONS AND NATURAL RESOURCES:</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR assumes sole responsibility for interpretation of any records of investigations of conditions in areas where Work is to be performed. Neither CONTRACTOR nor the OWNER assumes any responsibility whatsoever with respect to the sufficiency or accuracy of such investigations, the records thereof, or the representations set forth. There is no warranty or guarantee, either express or implied, that the conditions indicated by such investigations, or records thereof, are representative of those existing throughout such areas, or any part thereof, or that unforeseen developments may not occur, or that materials other than or in proportions different from those indicated may not be encountered. SUBCONTRACTOR shall have the sole responsibility for satisfying itself concerning the nature and location of the Work and the general and local conditions, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<p>F. Subsurface geology;</p>
<p>G. Topography and ground surface conditions;</p>
<p>H. Equipment and facilities needed preliminary to and during the performance of the Work;</p>
<p>I. Radiological conditions of surface or subsurface.</p>
<p>The failure of SUBCONTRACTOR to acquaint itself with any applicable conditions will not relieve SUBCONTRACTOR of the responsibility for properly estimating either the difficulties, time, or cost of successfully performing SUBCONTRACTOR'S obligations under this Subcontract.</p>
<p>GP-40 CLEANING UP:</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall at all times keep its Work areas in a neat, clean, and safe condition. Upon completion of any portion of the Work, SUBCONTRACTOR shall promptly remove from the Work area all its equipment, construction plant, temporary structures, and surplus materials not to be used at or near the same location during later stages of the Work.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the Work and prior to final payment, SUBCONTRACTOR shall at its expense satisfactorily dispose of all rubbish; remove all plant, buildings, equipment, and materials belonging to SUBCONTRACTOR; and return to CONTRACTOR'S warehouse or Jobsite storage area all salvageable CONTRACTOR or Government-supplied materials or equipment.

<p>GP-42 COOPERATION WITH OTHERS:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR, the OWNER, other contractors, and other subcontractors may be working at the Jobsite during the performance of this Subcontract, and SUBCONTRACTOR'S Work or use of certain facilities may be interfered with as a result of such concurrent activities. CONTRACTOR reserves the right to require SUBCONTRACTOR to schedule the order of performance of the Work in such a manner as will minimize interference with work of any of the Parties involved.</p>
<p><br />GP-43 ILLUMINATION AND SIGNAGE:</p>
<p>When any Work is performed at night or where daylight is obscured, SUBCONTRACTOR shall, at its expense, provide artificial light sufficient to permit Work to be carried on efficiently, satisfactorily, and safely and to permit thorough inspection. During such time periods, the access to the place of Work shall also be clearly illuminated. All wiring for electric light and power shall be installed and maintained in a safe manner and meet all applicable codes and standards.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall post signage as required by and in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and/or the Subcontract. In the event SUBCONTRACTOR proposes to post signage other than that as required above, SUBCONTRACTOR shall provide to the CONTRACTOR a description of the proposed signage to be posted, including size, color, content, configuration, sign location and the duration the sign is to remain in place. SUBCONTRACTOR shall not post any proposed sign until CONTRACTOR has approved the proposed posting.<br /><br />GP-44 LIENS:</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall neither file nor permit to be filed or imposed any laborer's, material men's, mechanics, or other lien with respect to the work to be performed or material furnished or on any part of the property on which work is performed hereunder and hereby waives any right to file or cause such a lien to be filed. In the event any claim has been asserted against SUBCONTRACTOR, CONTRACTOR or OWNER, or any lien has been filed with respect to the work, further payment shall not become due until all such claims or liens have been satisfied, released and/or discharged of record without cost or expense to CONTRACTOR. CONTRACTOR may, in default of SUBCONTRACTOR's obligation to do so, procure the release, satisfaction and discharge of any such claim or lien, and deduct all costs and expenses incurred in so doing from any money due or to become due hereunder; or if final payment has been made, SUBCONTRACTOR shall reimburse CONTRACTOR for all monies paid to discharge any such claim or lien, including the cost and expense thereof.</p>
<p>GP-45 CLAIMS:</p>
<p>"Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting Parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of Subcontract terms, or other relief arising under or derived from the Subcontract as a result of CONTRACTOR action or omission such that it would constitute a claim. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim hereunder. Disputes between the Parties hereto shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the Subcontract.</p>
<p>A claim, as described above, shall be made in writing and submitted to CONTRACTOR in advance of a request for final payment under the terms of the Subcontract. In the event of a claim by CONTRACTOR against SUBCONTRACTOR, which CONTRACTOR contends should involve adjustment of the Subcontract; CONTRACTOR shall promptly give written notice to SUBCONTRACTOR of any such claims.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall proceed diligently with performance of this Subcontract pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under this Subcontract and comply with any decision of CONTRACTOR.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR may issue a final written decision regarding the dispute and directing SUBCONTRACTOR to continue performance accordingly. CONTRACTOR'S decision shall be final unless SUBCONTRACTOR pursues resolution of the dispute in accordance with the General Provision entitled "DISPUTES." Should SUBCONTRACTOR ultimately prevail regarding any dispute, the final decision shall be deemed a change pursuant to the General Provision entitled "CHANGES."</p>
<p>GP-46 DISPUTES:</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall proceed diligently with performance of the Work, pending final resolution of any request for relief, dispute, claim, appeal, or action arising under the Subcontract, and comply with any decision of CONTRACTOR.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTOR shall not be entitled to and neither CONTRACTOR nor OWNER shall be liable to SUBCONTRACTOR or its lower-tier suppliers or subcontractors in tort (including negligence), or contract except as specifically provided in this Subcontract.</p>
<p>Any claim for an adjustment to the subcontract price or time of performance, which cannot be resolved by negotiation, shall be considered a dispute within the meaning of this clause.</p>
<p>If for any reason SUBCONTRACTOR and CONTRACTOR are unable to resolve a claim for an adjustment, SUBCONTRACTOR or CONTRACTOR shall notify the other party in writing that a dispute exists and request or provide a final determination by CONTRACTOR. Any such request by SUBCONTRACTOR shall be clearly identified by reference to this clause and shall summarize the facts in dispute and SUBCONTRACTOR'S proposal for resolution.</p>
<p>If CONTRACTOR'S final determination is not accepted by SUBCONTRACTOR the matter shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, be referred to senior executives of the parties who shall have designated authority to settle the dispute. The parties shall promptly prepare and exchange memoranda stating the issues in dispute and their respective positions, summarizing the negotiations that have taken place and attaching relevant documents.</p>
<p>The senior executives will meet for negotiations at a mutually agreed time and place. If the matter has not been resolved within thirty (30) calendar days of the commencement of such negotiations, the parties agree to consider resolution of the dispute through some form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process that is mutually acceptable to the parties.</p>
<p>Should the parties agree to pursue an ADR process; each party will be responsible for its own expenses incurred to resolve the dispute during the ADR process.</p>
<p>If the parties do not agree to an ADR process or are unable to resolve the dispute through ADR, either party shall then have the right to pursue any legal remedy. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws and judicial decisions of the State of Nevada, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. SUBCONTRACTOR further agrees that the sole and exclusive venue for any suit arising out of, or seeking to enforce, the terms of this Agreement shall be in a State or Federal Court of competent subject matter jurisdiction situated in the State of Nevada.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum With The Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest With The Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

API DHL-105 Rose Fiber KVM Extender is the only commercial KVM extender that meets the TEMPEST Level 2 standards as suggested by the CTTA.

(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 
API is the only company that sells KVM Extender with a TEMPEST level 2 certification.  

(7)	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
The best price available will be selected for the required equipment from multiple vendor quotes. 

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
We have performed market research and found no other KVM Extender products that have the TEMPEST level 2 certification. The API DHL-105 is the only KVM Extender that has the require TEMPEST level 2 certification. 

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
It is estimated that it would cost 3 to 4  times the purchase cost of $9,000.00 for another Contractor to be able to produce these items so that they would perform and be compatible with these specialized systems.  Estimated cost per each is as much as $36,000.00

None

None required.  

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(a)  The requirement for the FRC-B Bridge to meet TEMPEST level 2 standards limits the number of possible Commercial off the Shelf Products.  In order to minimize the risk of passing the TEMPEST level 2 certification, a TEMPEST level 2 approved KVM extender was chosen.   

(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. 
C2CEN is evaluating the API DHL-105 Rose Fiber KVM Extender as a possible replacement for the USB Extender as listed in FRC Circular of Requirements (COR) Section 425-2.27 to be use on SEAWATCH Fast Response Cutter (FRC) equipment.  The current Black Box KVM extender does not meet CTTA recommendation that the FRC-B Bridge must meet TEMPEST level 2 certification.

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) <br />(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." <br />(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. <br />Other End Products:<br />Line Item No. Country of Origin <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />[List as necessary] <br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Anticipated award date is on or about 27 November 2009. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Recovery Initiatives (ORI) is a new office in USAID Sudan that will replace and expand on the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). The ORI will serve as an operating unit within the USAID Mission to help local partners advance peace and democracy in Sudan. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, ORI will work on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition and recovery needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition while emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional relief or development assistance. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or failed transition. ORI will assist in securing peace in Sudan by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. ORI will use such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Office of Recovery Initiatives (ORI) is a new office in USAID Sudan that will replace and expand on the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). The ORI will serve as an operating unit within the USAID Mission to help local partners advance peace and democracy in Sudan. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, ORI will work on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition and recovery needs.</p>
<p>ORI's Sudan program is an integral part of the U.S. Government's effort to strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability. The ORI program will be implemented within the framework of both the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and other viable and internationally supported peace agreements. ORI will assume management of three OTI implementing partners in Sudan: AECOM International Sudan (AIS), Academy for Educational Development (AED), and ACORD. Through these implementing partners, the ORI program will implement activities with the following objectives: 1) supporting emerging civil and local authorities at the state and local levels; 2) promoting engagement of civil society in support of peace processes and dialogue with civil authorities; and 3) increasing availability of high-quality and independent information on transition issues. Additional objectives, programming approaches and partners may be identified to meet USAID Sudan's recovery assistance strategy in Sudan.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a USAID Sudan - Country Representative, Recovery Initiatives.</p>

The Office Director's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAID's recovery initiatives program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent USAID's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>This is a key management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half Street, S.W. (JR11-0203) <br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 10 AM Eastern Time on 16, Nov. 2009.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE: PLEASE READ THE SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO), AND OTHER ATTACHMENTS - MANY OF THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED ARE ALREADY COVERED IN THESE DOCUMENTS. THE SOO APPROACH HAS BEEN USED TO ALLOW MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY FOR EACH OFFEROR TO PROVIDE ITS OWN INNOVATIVE APPROACH/SOLUTION IN RESOLVING THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVES.
<p>Q80: Can you please post pictures of the T700 coupling shaft.<br />A80: Yes. Four photos have been attached for review.</p>
<p>Q81: What are the current maintenance schedules?<br />A81: Weekly, monthly, semiannual and annual preventive maintenance schedules, and calibration every 6 months.</p>
<p>Q82: The ATF3 test cell supports the HU-25 Falcon Jet which is currently being phased out with a twilight date of 2014. The SOO states that "all software must have the ability to be reprogrammed to accommodate a new engine type in the event the USCG re-engines the HU-25 Falcon." Which future engine is under consideration?<br />A82: The future engine selection has not been determined.</p>
<p>Q83: What is the capacity of the water reservoir?<br />A83: The current water reservoirs for the cooling tower and pump house are a 2000 gallon hot water reservoir and a 4000 gallon cold water reservoir. See facilities drawing number 400185; C4, T18, and T24.</p>
<p>Q84: Because of the volume of questions and that many have not yet been answered following the industry day event and because of the close time period between the Thanksgiving holiday and the proposal due date; we would like to respectfully request a two week extension on the proposal due date.<br />A84: A two-week extension is not possible. As explained at the Industry Day, the Coast Guard has a very limited time frame in which to obligate the funds for this project. Questions were due by close of business on November 16, 2009, and are being responded to in a timely manner. All questions received by the due date will be answered by close of business on November 20, 2009.</p>
<p>Q85: The FBO notice issued on 6 November indicates Sytronics has issued an appeal to the Office of Hearing and Appeals concerning the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation. Does this mean the Government is considering changing the NAICS Code? If so what is the alternative NAICS code the Government and/or Sytronics is requesting to be used?<br />A85: The Coast Guard does not intend to change the NAICS Code. However, the Coast Guard stands ready to fully comply with the findings of the SBA OHA. A response is expected from the OHA by close of business on November 20, 2009.</p>
<p>Q86: Since Sytronics has requested the Office of Hearing and Appeals to make a ruling on a new NAICS code for this solicitation, do potential offerors have a chance to provide comments to the OHA on the potential NAICS code change?<br />A86: SBA OHA rules of practice and other information can be found at www.sba.gov/oha.</p>
<p>Q87: Does the proposal Technical Volume 100 page limit include Factors II, III, and IV?<br />A87: As per Para 6 of the Proposal Submittal Instructions, "proposals, excluding pricing and manufacturer data sheets, shall not exceed 100 pages."</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to this RFI are cautioned that THIS SYNOPSIS/RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a request for proposal. The Government is not obligated to and shall not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non federal government activities regarding the information you provided in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The request is for a Network-Centric Emergency Notification System (NCENS) for emergency notification, recall and personnel accountability.</p>
<p>This NCENS system must:</p>

<p>The planned implementation will support up to 47,000 military and civilian personnel at AMC's 12 bases, and must support future implementation for up to 16,000 additional AMC personnel at geographically separated locations globally. Operators/Controllers of the system will be spread across all those locations. These operators will be able to initiate and manage alerts to support all personnel assigned to their respective subordinate units and users.</p>
<p>The system shall be composed of the following major components. <br />- Network Alerting System (NAS): A Network Alerting System with real-time response tracking - text messaging and desktop audio / visual notifications to Customer personnel, ensuring anyone connected to the IP network via desktop, laptop, or any other networked device, would be notified within a maximum of 3 minutes of an alert being sent out, with responses from recipients captured and reported in real time to operators; <br />- Telephony Alerting System (TAS): A capability to provide phone notification to Customer personnel utilizing an integrated phone alerting capability; and future integration with GFE installed alerting system. <br />- Unified Notification Management: A Unified Notification Management capability that includes the ability to (i) integrate with multiple notification delivery devices, (ii) initiate emergency alerts to any and all notification device via single web-based interface, (iii) manage single repository of emergency scenarios, (iv) enable real-time tracking and reporting, (v) manage permission-based access for operators, and (vi) integrate user data from disparate data sources such as Active Directory. <br />- Personnel Accountability: Personnel Accountability capability that includes the ability for (i) personnel / users to self-update their information so as to maintain up-to-date contact information for emergencies; and (ii) track responses to alert and provide reports that summarizes units and individual personnel responses / status.<br />- Giant Voice Integration: A future capability to activate existing Giant Voice systems at Customer locations.</p>
<p>3. Requested Information</p>

Technical qualifications that demonstrate a knowledge of network-centric emergency notification systems<br />8. Optional - provide recommendation for alternate NAICS code, if the one provided is too restrictive or not restrictive enough as to business size and industry category<br /><br />4. Responses</p>
<p>Responses shall be limited to 60 pages.</p>
<p>5. Industry Discussions</p>
<p>Air Force representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>6. Questions</p>

<p>7. Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide a NETWORK-CENTRIC EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need for services in support of its International Technology Scanning Program by managing, coordinating, conducting, and documenting international scan studies. International scans identify and evaluate innovative technologies and practices in other countries that could significantly improve highway transportation in the United States. The program enables innovations to be adapted and put into practice in the United States much more efficiently without spending scarce research funds to re-create advances already developed by other countries. On each international scan, the selected contractor will review and assess innovative technologies, policies, and practices in other countries that may provide better highways and highway system performance in the United States. The contractor will provide implementation guidance and assistance to scan teams upon conclusion of each international scan. Tracking and documenting the implementation of new technologies and practices identified on international scans, as well as the resulting benefits, will also be a requirement for this contract.

(2) “Commercial derivative military article” means an item procured by the Department of Defense that is or will be produced using the same production facilities, a common supply chain, and the same or similar production processes that are used for the production of articles predominantly used by the general public or by nongovernmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes.
(3) “Commercially available off-the-shelf item”—
(i) Means any item of supply that is—
(A) A commercial item;
(B) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(C) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
(ii) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.
(4) “Component” means any item supplied to the Government as part of an end item or of another component.
(5) “Electronic component” means an item that operates by controlling the flow of electrons or other electrically charged particles in circuits, using interconnections of electrical devices such as resistors, inductors, capacitors, diodes, switches, transistors, or integrated circuits.
(6) “End item” means the final production product when assembled or completed, and ready for issue, delivery, or deployment.
(7) “Produce” means the application of forces or processes to a specialty metal to create desired physical properties through quenching or tempering of steel plate, or gas atomization or sputtering of titanium.
(8) “Qualifying country” means any country listed in subsection 225.872-1(a) or (b) of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
(9) “Required form” means in the form of mill product, such as bar, billet, wire, slab, plate or sheet, and in the grade appropriate for the production of—
(i) A finished end item delivered to the Department of Defense; or
(ii) A finished component assembled into an end item delivered to the Department of Defense.
(10) “Specialty metal” means—
(i) Steel—
(A) With a maximum alloy content exceeding one or more of the following limits: manganese, 1.65 percent; silicon, 0.60 percent; or copper, 0.60 percent; or
(B) Containing more than 0.25 percent of any of the following elements: aluminum, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, niobium (columbium), titanium, tungsten, or vanadium.
(ii) Metal alloys consisting of—
(A) Nickel or iron-nickel alloys that contain a total of alloying metals other than nickel and iron in excess of 10 percent; or
(B) Cobalt alloys that contain a total of alloying metals other than cobalt and iron in excess of 10 percent;
(iii) Titanium and titanium alloys; or
(iv) Zirconium and zirconium base alloys.
(11) “Subsystem” means a functional grouping of items that combine to perform a major function within an end item, such as electrical power, attitude control, and propulsion.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, any specialty metals incorporated in items delivered under this contract shall be melted or produced in the United States, its outlying areas, or a qualifying country, except for—
(1) Electronic components;
(2) (i) Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items; other than—
(A) COTS fasteners, unless such fasteners are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, assemblies, or components.
(B) Forgings or castings of specialty metals, unless such forgings or castings are incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, or assemblies.
(C) Commercially available high performance magnets, unless such high performance magnets are incorporated into COTS end items or subsystems;
(ii) A COTS item is considered to be “offered without modification” as long as it is not modified prior to contractual acceptance by the next higher tier in the supply chain.
(A) Specialty metals contained in a COTS item that was accepted without modification by the next higher tier are excepted and remain excepted even if a piece of the COTS item subsequently is removed (e.g., the end is removed from a COTS screw or an extra hole is drilled in a COTS bracket).
(B) For specialty metals that were not contained in a COTS item upon acceptance, but are added to the COTS item after acceptance, the added specialty metals are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a special reinforced handle made of specialty metal that is added to a COTS item).
(C) If two or more COTS items are combined in such a way that the resultant item is not a COTS item, only the specialty metals involved in joining the COTS items together are subject to the restrictions (e.g., a COTS aircraft is outfitted with a COTS engine, but not a COTS engine normally provided with that aircraft.)
(D) For COTS items that are normally sold in the commercial marketplace with various options, items that include such options are also COTS items. However, if a COTS item is offered to the Government with an option that is not normally offered in the commercial marketplace, that option is subject to the specialty metals restrictions. (e.g., An aircraft is normally sold to the public with an option for several different radios. DoD requests a military-unique radio. The aircraft is still a COTS item, but the military-unique radio is not a COTS item, and must comply with the specialty metals restrictions, unless another excerption applies.)
(3) Fasteners that are commercial items that are purchased under a contract or subcontract with a manufacturer of such fasteners, if the manufacturer has certified that it will purchase, during the relevant calendar year, an amount of domestically melted specialty metal, in the required form, for use in the production of fasteners for sale to the Department of Defense and other customers, that is not less than 50% of the total amount of the specialty metal that it will purchase to carry out the production of such fasteners for all customers.
(4) Items manufactured in a qualifying country;
(5) Items for which the Government has determined in accordance with 225.700x-3 of Class Deviation 2008-O0002 that specialty metal melted or produced in the United States cannot be acquired as and when needed in—
(i) A satisfactory quality;
(ii) A sufficient quantity; and
(iii) The required form.
(6) Specialty metals, other than specialty metals in high performance magnets, that do not meet any of the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this clause, if the total weight of such noncompliant metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of specialty metals in the item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor.

(c) (1) Streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles. As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, In the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause if—
(i) This is an acquisition of commercial derivative military articles; and
(ii) The Contractor has certified in its offer in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
(2) Certification for streamlined compliance for commercial derivative military articles (to be submitted with offer when applicable). The offeror [  ] certifies  [  ] does not certify that prior to award it will have entered into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in the required form for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, that is not less than the Contractor’s good faith estimate of the greater of—
(i) An amount equivalent to 120% of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article (including the work performed under each subcontract); or
(ii) An amount equivalent to 50% of the amount of specialty metal that is purchased by the contractor and its subcontractors for use during such period in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article.
(3) For the purposes of the certification in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article includes specialty metal contained in any item, including commercially available off-the-shelf items, incorporated into such commercial derivative military article.

(d) Unless the Contractor has certified in accordance with paragraph (c), the Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, excluding paragraph (c) but including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts for articles containing specialty metals.

(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the  7th  day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

(3) “Payment request” means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

(End of clause)

52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(i) Company legal business.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(vi) Date the company was started.

(vii) Number of employees at your location.

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.

(ix) Line of business (industry).

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

 	J.17 Evaluation: Relative Experience and Past Performance:  The SSEB shall evaluate relative Past Performance by considering such factors as similarity of test cell, an offeror's business practices, customer relationship, offerors ability to successfully perform on prior relevant contracts.  The SSEB will consider in their evaluation recent and relevant past performance and responses to prior client’s questionnaires.  Current, Relevant, Trends:  Evaluators will consider the current, relevant and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  Current is performance occurring within the past five (5) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.

These ratings may not have the same weight as the ratings of the proposing company.   If such information is not applicable (i.e., the offeror does not have a predecessor company, key personnel or subcontractors with relevant experience), the offeror shall be evaluated as "neutral”. However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant Past Performance history, while rated ”Neutral” in Past Performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. 

		J.20. In evaluating performance confidence, the Government may contact your references for additional information and to assure validity of the received questionnaires. The Government may contact sources other than those provided by the offeror for information with respect to past performance. These other sources may include, but are not limited to telephone interviews, and Government personnel with personal knowledge of the offeror’s performance capability.  The Government reserves the rights to obtain and evaluate past performance information from any source it deems appropriate.

		J.21. In accordance with FAR 15.106(a)(2), if award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information or to resolve minor clerical errors.

The purpose of the oral presentations is to provide the offeror with the opportunity to briefly explain any specific documentation provided, to highlight the special features of their proposal, and to identify the benefits of the offeror’s technical data proposal.  Any betterments or deviations that the offeror wishes the Government to consider should be discussed in detail in the oral presentation. The offeror is expected to highlight significant technical points contained in their proposal but will not be permitted to submit anything new, but may expand on anything contained in the proposal. Offerors are cautioned that all information provided, regardless of the format, i.e. written proposal, oral presentation, shall be considered as proposal information, and used in the evaluation process.
 
Section K - Evaluation Factors for Award

(See Section L for proposal submission and evaluation of selection factor) 
              K.1 Basis of Award:  The award shall be based on the evaluation of three factors: (1) Relevant Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings (shown below) will be provided for Relative Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach.    
	      K.2. Price:   The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offeror’s proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offerors understanding of the proposal requirements.  Price is not separately rated.

	a. The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. 

	b. Price evaluation will consider reasonableness and realistic prices associated with the offeror’s overall technical proposal solution.  Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost criteria may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines:  A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or the Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a)(1) and (4).  

	c. For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. 

	d. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.

	K.3. The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal the Source Selection Authority has determined conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and the offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all non-priced factors described herein, and price. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are considered approximately equal to price, however the contract award price shall not exceed $1,570,000.00.   The intent of this solicitation is to obtain the best proposal within the cost limitation. There is no obligation to approach or match the cost limitation in the offer.  After the Government individually evaluates and rates each proposal, the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority will compare the RFP requirements to determine which proposal represents the best value.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.  The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.0001.  If there is a lower priced conforming offer(s), the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Official must determine that the added value of more expensive proposal (within the cost limitation) would justify award to that offeror.  As part of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate betterments in proposals relative to the minimum standards of the RFP to determine if they offer additional value to the Government.      
      
	Organization and Technical Approach Ratings and Definitions: 

Excellent	Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Agency.  Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting government requirements.  
Good	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Agency.  Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the agency’s requirements.  
Satisfactory	Proposal meets most of the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements. Advantages were offset by disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by offeror were acceptable.  Fair probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements.
Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal, but acceptable contract performance. Proposal would require major rewrites to make it acceptable. Probability of success is questionable without discussions with the offeror.     
Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations; there is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Agency’s requirements. Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or resubmission.  Unacceptable risk, not awardable as proposed

 

             Relative Past Performance Confidence Ratings:   The following ratings and related definitions will be used to define the performance risk:

Very High Degree of Confidence	Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very high degree of confidence the contractor will meet or exceed the Government's requirements.  
High Confidence	Performance met contract requirements. Good quality. Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve where appropriate. Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant. Good probability of success with overall high degree of confidence in meeting the government's requirements.
Average Confidence	Performance met most contract requirements. Adequate quality. Problems were identified however; contractor usually took adequate corrective action. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  OR Although performance generally exceeds expectations and was generally rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. Fair probability of success with an average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements.
Below Average Confidence	Performance met some contract requirements. Fair quality. Problems were identified however; contractor sometimes took corrective action, but not always to the owner’s satisfaction. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant. Probability of success is unclear with an overall below average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements. 
Low Degree of Confidence	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature. Contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective. Performance was current and generally relevant to semi- relevant. Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably low degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government’s requirements.  
Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment. Unknown

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA’s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a request fail to materialize, no basis for claims against NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. 

This is accomplished by:
•	Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;
•	Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors;
•	Providing grants to state and local government to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs; and
•	Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.

Motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the United States, providing an unprecedented degree of mobility. Yet for all its advantages, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people of every age from 3 through 34 (based on 2006 data). Traffic fatalities accounted for more than 90 percent of transportation-related fatalities.  

Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belt use and preventing impaired driving have significant impact on meeting NHTSA’s core goals however the Agency needs to have the ability to develop new communication strategies to address current, new, and emerging traffic safety issues since a number of factors contribute to traffic deaths and injuries.

While highly visible enforcement activity continues to be an anchor for NHTSA’s national communications program, other integrated communications activity must continue throughout the year to keep the message fresh and in front of the American public. Public attention must continue to be reminded of the horrific human and economic costs of motor vehicle crashes. Effective communication must be maintained not only with the strategic target audiences, but policy makers must also be made aware of the potential lifesaving actions they can take to alleviate these problems.

The purpose of this statement of work is for the acquisition of services and products required by NHTSA to field successful and effective public service campaigns: refinement of campaign strategy and focus, technical assistance, creation of multimedia advertising products to carry out strategies, dissemination of multimedia products to national and local media outlets, development and placement, and monitoring and reporting the results of media placement efforts.

<a href="mailto:james.poe@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALTO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the CAI Frederick, Frederick, MD, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).2.  Nature/Description of Action.This activity proposes to negotiate a limited source firm fixed price award based on the Unusual and Compelling Urgency for the procurement of temporary services to assist in the processing of Veteran Educational claims for Montgomery GI Bill benefits for the next 90 days.  3.  Description of Supplies/Services.On June 30, 2008, Congress passed a law to create the Post-9/11 GI Bill, a new VA education benefit program for individuals who have served on active duty after September 10, 2001.  This complex new benefit program differs greatly from existing education benefits VA currently pays.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill consists of up to five different payments per beneficiary.  Each of these payments may vary between individuals, and are pro-rated based upon the individual's length of service.  Also, payments are made to both the student's school and the student.  This is a drastic contrast from current benefits, which primarily pay a set rate based upon length of service, and pay directly to the beneficiary.  Existing VA systems are unable to accommodate the multiple payments to multiple entities required under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. As a result, VA was required to develop a solution for processing and paying benefits under this new program.  VA internal resources were combined to develop a computer-assisted manual solution that could process and pay benefits by the Congressionally-mandated date of August 1, 2009.  Simultaneously, VA began work with the Space and Naval Warfare Command to develop a highly-automated claims processing system to be deployed in December 2010.  Until deployment of the long term solution, VA is relying upon the computer-assisted manual process.VA began to accept applications for the Post-9/11 GI Bill on May 1, 2009.  In response to this, VA's workload grew substantially.  Claims processing using the computer-assisted manual solution require considerable time and a significant amount of training, and as a result VA's efficiency in claims processing has decreased.   Additionally, VA had anticipated a decrease in usage of the other programs following Post-9/11 GI Bill implementation.  However, use of other benefit programs has remained similar to past years, despite the increase in beneficiaries under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA began to accept enrollment certifications from schools on July 6, 2009, and paid the first benefit checks under the Post-9/11 GI Bill on August 3, 2009.  Due to the tremendous response to the program, consistent use of other benefits, and slow manual processing procedures, VA's pending claims workload has continued to grow to over 100,000 claims, and many beneficiaries currently attending school are still awaiting payment.  In order to resolve this situation, VA seeks contractor support to evaluate and make recommendations on pending supplemental claims for the Montgomery GI Bill.  The Montgomery GI Bill claims are not as complex and will allow for a rapid response with Government supported training.The contractor will need to provide the facilities and all necessary supplies and equipment needed to process the claims.  The VA will provide trainers to assist with the processing of the claims and will retain the final approval authority for any claim processed by the contractor.  The nature of this requirement requires that the contractor have a secure facility or facilities and maintain an IT security infrastructure that meets the Governments standard.The estimated total value of this 3 month requirement is $532,847.60  4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency as implemented by FAR 6.302-2.5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.A Request for Proposal will be provided to four contractors that currently provide data call center services to the State Department and Department of Transportation.  The fact that these contractors currently have secure facilities and personnel with background clearance investigations will allow for claim processing services to begin within 5 days after award.6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.This acquisition will not be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the exception granted at FAR 5.202(2).  Market research was conducted and a Request for Proposal will be issued to several vendors with similar experience in government data claim processing to provide for a competitive award.  Future requirements will be considered for competitive awards.7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of the Independent Government Cost Estimate and proposals received from solicited vendors.8.  Description of Market Survey.Market research was conducted and several government contractors have been identified that have secure data processing centers and qualified personnel in place.  These vendors are the only sources available that can meet the immediate needs of the VA due to the sensitivity of the privacy information that is involved, the volume of claims to be processed, and the short amount of time available to complete performance before undo harm occurs.9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.The Department of Veteran Affairs is currently delinquent in processing Veteran Educational Benefits.  These defaults are causing economic hardship for the Veteran community and could result in the cancellation of their enrollment and potential removal from these learning institutions.  Montgomery GI Bill Educational Benefits are guaranteed by Statue and are the equivalent of a default by the United States Government.  Over 100,000 educational claims of various types are currently in delinquent status. The Educational benefits were promised to our Activity Duty Military Personnel and Veterans for service provided to protect and serve our country.  Untimely processing of these claims would result in financial harm to government personnel, veterans, and the higher learning institutions.10.  Listing of Interested Sources.Citibank N.A.						 388 Greenwich Street					New York, NY 10013					ACS Federal Solutions, LLC,1800 M ST NW Suite 700SWashington, DC 20036-5807Vangent Inc, 						4250 N. Fairfax Drive					Suite 1200						Arlington, VA 22203Lockheed Martin9221 Corporate BLVDRockville, MD 20850-324511.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.A long term technology contract has been awarded and a new automated process is expected to be delivered by December 2010.  Additionally, long-term claim processing assistance will be evaluated and determined to be in compliance with Section 43 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act before an acquisition solution would be executed.

<DESC>A radiation tolerant high performance (100M Samples/second) 32-bit lossless customprocessor will be delivered in the proposed work which meets the CCSDS 121-0-B 1recommendation. The processor will be implemented in a radiation tolerant 0.25 micronCMOS process which realizes a proven algorithm developed at GSFC and implemented in a15-bit version 10 years ago. The new compressor is 5 times faster and has twice the inputquantization range, suitable for modern spacecraft requirements. The net-list (design) ofthe processor can be used to synthesize a future 200 Msamples/sec plus data rates when asub-100 nm radiation tolerant fabrication process is available.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALTO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the CAI Frederick, Frederick, MD, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).2.  Nature/Description of Action.This activity proposes to negotiate a limited source firm fixed price award based on the Unusual and Compelling Urgency for the procurement of temporary services to assist in the processing of Veteran Educational claims for Montgomery GI Bill benefits for the next 90 days.  3.  Description of Supplies/Services.On June 30, 2008, Congress passed a law to create the Post-9/11 GI Bill, a new VA education benefit program for individuals who have served on active duty after September 10, 2001.  This complex new benefit program differs greatly from existing education benefits VA currently pays.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill consists of up to five different payments per beneficiary.  Each of these payments may vary between individuals, and are pro-rated based upon the individual's length of service.  Also, payments are made to both the student's school and the student.  This is a drastic contrast from current benefits, which primarily pay a set rate based upon length of service, and pay directly to the beneficiary.  Existing VA systems are unable to accommodate the multiple payments to multiple entities required under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. As a result, VA was required to develop a solution for processing and paying benefits under this new program.  VA internal resources were combined to develop a computer-assisted manual solution that could process and pay benefits by the Congressionally-mandated date of August 1, 2009.  Simultaneously, VA began work with the Space and Naval Warfare Command to develop a highly-automated claims processing system to be deployed in December 2010.  Until deployment of the long term solution, VA is relying upon the computer-assisted manual process.VA began to accept applications for the Post-9/11 GI Bill on May 1, 2009.  In response to this, VA's workload grew substantially.  Claims processing using the computer-assisted manual solution require considerable time and a significant amount of training, and as a result VA's efficiency in claims processing has decreased.   Additionally, VA had anticipated a decrease in usage of the other programs following Post-9/11 GI Bill implementation.  However, use of other benefit programs has remained similar to past years, despite the increase in beneficiaries under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA began to accept enrollment certifications from schools on July 6, 2009, and paid the first benefit checks under the Post-9/11 GI Bill on August 3, 2009.  Due to the tremendous response to the program, consistent use of other benefits, and slow manual processing procedures, VA's pending claims workload has continued to grow to over 100,000 claims, and many beneficiaries currently attending school are still awaiting payment.  In order to resolve this situation, VA seeks contractor support to evaluate and make recommendations on pending supplemental claims for the Montgomery GI Bill.  The Montgomery GI Bill claims are not as complex and will allow for a rapid response with Government supported training.The contractor will need to provide the facilities and all necessary supplies and equipment needed to process the claims.  The VA will provide trainers to assist with the processing of the claims and will retain the final approval authority for any claim processed by the contractor.  The nature of this requirement requires that the contractor have a secure facility or facilities and maintain an IT security infrastructure that meets the Governments standard.The estimated total value of this 3 month requirement is $532,847.60  4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency as implemented by FAR 6.302-2.5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.A Request for Proposal will be provided to four contractors that currently provide data call center services to the State Department and Department of Transportation.  The fact that these contractors currently have secure facilities and personnel with background clearance investigations will allow for claim processing services to begin within 5 days after award.6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.This acquisition will not be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the exception granted at FAR 5.202(2).  Market research was conducted and a Request for Proposal will be issued to several vendors with similar experience in government data claim processing to provide for a competitive award.  Future requirements will be considered for competitive awards.7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of the Independent Government Cost Estimate and proposals received from solicited vendors.8.  Description of Market Survey.Market research was conducted and several government contractors have been identified that have secure data processing centers and qualified personnel in place.  These vendors are the only sources available that can meet the immediate needs of the VA due to the sensitivity of the privacy information that is involved, the volume of claims to be processed, and the short amount of time available to complete performance before undo harm occurs.9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.The Department of Veteran Affairs is currently delinquent in processing Veteran Educational Benefits.  These defaults are causing economic hardship for the Veteran community and could result in the cancellation of their enrollment and potential removal from these learning institutions.  Montgomery GI Bill Educational Benefits are guaranteed by Statue and are the equivalent of a default by the United States Government.  Over 100,000 educational claims of various types are currently in delinquent status. The Educational benefits were promised to our Activity Duty Military Personnel and Veterans for service provided to protect and serve our country.  Untimely processing of these claims would result in financial harm to government personnel, veterans, and the higher learning institutions.10.  Listing of Interested Sources.Citibank N.A.						ACS Federal Solutions, LLC, 388 Greenwich Street					1800 M ST NW Suite 700SNew York, NY 10013					Washington, DC 20036-5807Vangent Inc, 						Lockheed Martin4250 N. Fairfax Drive					9221 Corporate BLVDSuite 1200						Rockville, MD 20850-3245Arlington, VA 2220311.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.A long term technology contract has been awarded and a new automated process is expected to be delivered by December 2010.  Additionally, long-term claim processing assistance will be evaluated and determined to be in compliance with Section 43 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act before an acquisition solution would be executed.
