<DESC>The Government intends to restrict competition to specific brand name products (VMware, Cisco, and EMC) of information technology hardware, software, and storage.  These brand name products are all offered by multiple authorized resellers, and the solicitation with the specifications list (Request for Quote) will be open to any potential offeror who is an authorized reseller and can provide ALL brands required.<br /><br />A new initiative to modernize the legacy Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services (DIAMONDS) architecture to be more capable, supportable, secure, and cost effective using newer technologies, as well as comply with DoD mandates.&nbsp; DIAMONDS is a closed, fully integrated environment, so all hardware and software for the testbed are specifically selected because of their ability to seamlessly interoperate.&nbsp; Mixing vendors will provide a sub-optimal operating environment and require more resources than available to the program to integrate, operate, and manage, and will also significantly increase the complexity of the project, resulting in increased ongoing costs.&nbsp; The DIAMONDS Next Generation (DNG)&nbsp;testbed will provide DTRA the opportunity to validate marketing claims against reality within the DIAMONDS operating environment, while simultaneously building the experience and knowledge base to plan, design, and implement the future production environment.<br /><br />A&nbsp;single procurement will be used to provide the most cost effective solution, both in terms of procurement and setup. This will avoid additional coordination among vendors to ensure compatibility of products and also avoid potentially longer delivery and setup schedules and to ensure components aren't delivered on separate schedules. As these products represent new technologies to the DIAMONDS program, it is essential to have a single supplier to work with to resolve any/all problems during setup and configuration, without the risk of multiple vendors placing blame on the others. All products are mainstream, readily available items with many suppliers able to deliver.&nbsp; No item is exclusive to a limited subset of vendors.<br /><br />We identified a number of benefits with using engineered servers. Virtual Computing Environment (VCE), LLC.&nbsp;is a collaborative partnership between VMware (software), Cisco (hardware), and EMC (storage) that provides engineered servers rather than requiring buyers or separate system integrators to integrate hardware and software. We selected the VCE Vblock architecture over competing products because it is fully compatible with the Cisco UCS products (Cisco is one of the key components), and provides single vendor support, which will potentially save the DIAMONDS program significant money, time, and resources. The VCE Vblock servers are all able to be remotely managed using the same software tools as the Cisco UCS servers selected. We plan to evaluate the benefits of the VCE engineered products relative to integrating components in the DIAMONDS program to determine benefits. <br />

<DESC>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 23 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 23 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 23 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Monday, November 16, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (<a href="mailto:anne.mastrincola@dla.mil">anne.mastrincola@dla.mil</a>).<br /><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 23 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Tuesday, November 17, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Thursday, December 17, 2015.<br /><br />DLA Aviation

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 9 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 9 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 9 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Monday, November 16, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (<a href="mailto:anne.mastrincola@dla.mil">anne.mastrincola@dla.mil</a>).&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 9 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Tuesday, November 17, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Thursday, December 17, 2015.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 1005-01-632-4762- Motor, Booster, bought in accordance with Skurka Aerospace (95270) part number K479-C43439. Surplus material will not be accepted. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 15 each with no option shipping to (W62G2T) Tracy, CA 95376-5000. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 11/17/15. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 375 days. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />Export Controls (ITAR/MLI) apply. JCP certification will be required. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: US/Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800)-352-3572. The DLIS US/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.ccal/.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA, 92122-4616, to provide maintenance services for the Illlumina NextSeq 500 located in the Center for Human Immunology (CHI)in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.</p>
<p>The purview of DIR's research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders.</p>
<p>The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation is a trans-NIH project that began in 2009. The term 'trans-NIH' simply means the Center is supported by and works with many different institutes at NIH. The goal of CHI is to understand human immunology and to use that knowledge to develop new treatments for human diseases. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation. Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce illness and disability throughout the world. The laboratory requires a maintenance agreement for the Illumina NextSeq 500 desktop sequencer.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Base: November 15, 2015 through November 14, 2016<br />Option Period 1: November 15, 2016 through November 14, 2017<br />Option Period 2: November 15, 2017 through November 14, 2018<br />Option Period 3: November 15, 2018 through November 14, 2019<br />Option Period 4: November 15, 2019 through November 14, 2020</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) will host a Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) Industry Engagement Event on December 3, 2015 in Washington D.C. Industry partners unable to attend in person may participate via a phone conference line. (Event location details and conference line information will be forwarded to registered participants). <br />DNDO Radiation Portal Monitor Program systems are used to scan containerized cargo, commercial conveyances, and privately owned vehicles for illicit nuclear and other radioactive materials. The goal of this RPM Industry Engagement Event is to provide industry with information on Replay Tool capabilities required by DNDO and also to provide industry with information on the upcoming RPM Data Collection Event planned for April 2016. The Data Collection Event will provide industry partners with the opportunity to scan DNDO supplied radiation sources, including special nuclear material, with their RPM systems. Knowledge of future Replay Tool requirements and participation in the RPM Data Collection Event may prepare industry partners for a future DNDO RPM solicitation anticipated in Fiscal Year 2017. <br />

2. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.

3.  In order to receive an award the laboratory shall be approved by Mid-Pacific Regions Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch, MP-156.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit as stated below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratorys QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.

Audit Process:

The MP-156 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratorys QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.

Background Review:

Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
  
Performance Evaluation Samples:

Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratorys ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  

If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.

Audit Agenda:

Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. 

Onsite Audit:

An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratorys expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices.
  
Meet with Management:

The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch (MP-156).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-156s policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   

Analytical Method and Document Review:

During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratorys QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:

The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report. 
 
Audit Report:

Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt. 
 
Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval Letter:

The laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA sections audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.

Once the review of the laboratorys audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
 
System for Award Management (SAM), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH'S (NIH) OFFICE OF RESEARCH FACILITIES (ORF) IS REQUESTING INFORMATION AND INTERESTED VENDORS FOR PERFORMING POST DESIGN A/E SERVICES (INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONING) IN SUPPORT OF THE BUILDING 10 F-WING RENOVATION PROJECT, BETHESDA, MD.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project Background:</strong></span></p>
<p>The world's largest clinical research hospital is a complex of buildings on the NIH campus known as Building 10 or the Clinical Center Complex (CCC). While over the years the CCC has expanded from its original 1951 structure to encompass important additions, portions of the original Building 10 facility are no longer capable of supporting modern research. The building infrastructure is undersized, exceeded its useful life, and must be replaced with current state-of-the-art equipment to provide sufficient and reliable support for research.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in 2009, ORF acquired the services of an A/E of Record to prepare 100% construction documents necessary for the complete renovation of the F-Wing of Building 10 (floors 2 through 14). Due to the partial, continued occupancy of the North Corridor portions of floors 6 through 13 the project was designed to be accomplished in two phases.<br />The construction was awarded in July 2010 and consists of a 5-year Base period (Phase A) and one 5-year Option period (Phase B): the Option period was exercised concurrently with the Base period.</p>
<p>Phase A consists of:<br /><br />a. The conversion of approximately 64,000 GSF of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14. <br />b. Phase A also includes installation of mechanical equipment on the 14th floor and treatment tanks on floor B-1 and related alterations/piping on floors 1 and B-2.<br />Phase B consists of:<br />c. The conversion of approximately 151,600 GSF of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14. <br />d. Phase B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Phase A.<br />Currently, the Phase A and Phase B Construction is behind schedule; completion is anticipated in 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of the Requirement:</span></strong></p>

<DESC>SLAC seeks vendors that can provide the following:
<p><br />Five (5) Mirror vacuum chambers and high precision mover systems (VCMS) for LCLS</p>
<p>SLAC/LCLS is seeking for a supplier of five mechanical systems as part of the Hard X-ray Mirror upgrade project.<br />Each system is composed by two main parts:</p>
<p>The mirror assembly (with mirror holder, bender, and interface plate) designed and realized by SLAC and not part of this requisition.</p>
<p>The vacuum chamber and mover system (including all the motions, motors, encoders and supports) to be designed and provided by the supplier.</p>
<p>The VCMS has to be UHV compatible, hosting a 1 m long mirror (plus his holder, cooling and bender), and provide pointing stability better than 25 nrad rms.</p>
<p>The Vendor is responsible for providing complete, tested systems and mechanics, delivered safely to SLAC, and to participate in the installation of the systems in their final locations.</p>
<p>The Vendor is responsible for performing all necessary tests, to guarantee that all specifications and requirements are met.</p>
<p>The Vendor is responsible for providing all necessary documentation to the SLAC team, to enable future connection, installation, and operation of the VCMS, and to maintain them at their specified performance. The five systems will be identical, except for the deflection direction. In fact, all the mirrors deflect sideway, three in one direction and two in the other.</p>
<p>All the motions have to be performed by moving the entire chamber. Angular motion as large as 7 mrad with 50 nrad steps and transversal motion as large as 20 mm with 0.01 mm step are required.</p>
<p><br />The cooling and bending system is designed by SLAC. SLAC will provide the exact location (with respect the mirror optical pole) and dimension of the flanges needed to accommodate them. SLAC will also provide a detailed drawing of the interface plate and all the drawings the vendor will need to properly accommodate the mirror assembly into the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. VENDORS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE SHOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" VIA THE FBO PORTAL. DO NOT CONTACT THE SUBCONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR.</strong></p>

o	Specimen loss due to breakage, spillage, insufficient dry ice, misplacement, mishandling or any other Contractor-related problem(s) will be considered unacceptable if more than 1.0% specimens per facility per billing period are compromised.  Repeated problems with compromised specimens may be grounds for termination of the contract by default.
o	Any specimens that have been broken, leaked, or been otherwise compromised during transit must be reported to the appropriate VANHEHS facility immediately upon unpacking at the Contractor's laboratory.  The Contractor is required to pick-up the new specimen at no additional cost to the Government.  The pick-up of the new specimen must be made during the routine courier pick-up times, unless emergency pick-up is requested.
o	The Contractor shall provide timely and appropriate testing of patient specimens as requested by VANEHS facilities.  A list of tests is located in Attachment B.
o	Contractor shall provide Emergency testing services for all procedures VA deems necessary.  The test results will be reported within four (4) hours from the time the specimen is received in the Contractor's reference laboratory.
o	Specimens must be stored by the Contractor for at least seven (7) days after the reporting of the results.  In selected cases, and upon request by a site, the Contractor must store specimens for up to thirty (30) days at no additional cost.  The VA may request repeat determinations or add-on tests by telephone during this 7- or extended 30-day period.  Repeat determinations will be requested by sites when test results do not fit the clinical picture of the patient, and must be performed at no cost to the Government.  Specimen retention applies to blood, serum, CSF, urine, and other body fluids.  In no case will the contractor or subcontractor retain specimens for less than the minimum required by CLIA or the state in which the testing is performed. 
o	All anatomic pathology specimen(s) (e.g., blocks, slides or other diagnostic material) must be returned by courier or expedited shipping methods to the submitting facility within seven (7) days after final diagnosis.
a.	A report of laboratory testing results is defined either as a printed final copy or host to host electronic transmission of test results. The Contractor shall deliver these reports by messenger delivery and/or electronic report transmission via computer interface.   Specifications outlining the requirements of this computer interface including computer hardware, maintenance and supply requirements are defined in Section I, Telecommunication Requirements below. Unsatisfactory specimen shall be reported with documentation supporting its unsuitability for testing.
					Each test report shall, at minimum, include the following information:
i.	Patient's name and/or identification number
ii.	Physician's name (if supplied) 
iii.	VANEHS medical record number or laboratory accession number(if supplied)  
iv.	VANEHS submitting facility name
v.	Patient's location (clinic/ward) (if supplied) 
vi.	    Test ordered 
vii.	Date/time of specimen collection (when available)
viii.	Date of specimen receipt 
ix.	     Date/time test completed
x.	    Test result
xi.	Reference intervals
xii.	     Toxic and therapeutic ranges, if applicable
xiii.	 Flagged abnormals 
xiv.	Reference laboratory specimen number 
xv.	Name of testing laboratory if other than contractor. 
xvi.	Any other information the laboratory has that may indicate a questionable validity of test results.  
o	The test results must be received by each VANEHS facility in accordance with the test set-
up schedule submitted with the offer and made a part of this contract.  Electronically transmitted test results will be received by the VANEHS facility within 1 hour or less of test completion.  Preliminary reports will be delivered for those tests requiring such, as specified by the test schedule.
o	Critical test results as defined by the Contractor's commercial reference test manual shall be communicated by telephone to a designated VA contact person(s) at the originating VA laboratory facility upon verification of the critical test result. The VA laboratory will provide the contractor with point of contact information for critical test results at each site. Each VA laboratory is responsible for communicating critical test results received from the contracted commercial reference laboratory to the ordering clinician or designee.
o	The Contractor shall provide an integrated system approach to facilitate and streamline all aspects of specimen ordering, testing and reporting.  As such, the Contractor shall provide and program an interface system to electronically transmit orders, specimen status and test results between the Contractor's host computer system and the VA's host computer system (VistA). 
o	VistA supports a Universal Interface (UI) and a Generic Interface Manager (GIM).  The GIM is a commercial hardware and software product that provides electronic connection between the Contractor's host computer and the VistA host computer.  The configuration provides the required security of the VA host computer system.  The actual electronic connection between the GIM and the Contractor' host system is of the Contractor's choosing. The expense of the electronic message connectivity is born by the Contractor.
o	All electronic messaging between the two (Contractor and VistA) computer systems using the GIM shall conform to VistA Health Level Seven (HL7) V1.6 and Laboratory's HL7 V1.0 technical specifications.  Health Level 7 (HL7) is a registered trademark of Health Level Seven, Inc, is a Standards Developing Organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute to author consensus-based standards.  Information regarding HL7 transmission protocols may be accessed through the Health Level Seven, Inc web-site, www.HL7.org.
o	Data connectivity between the Contractor and the VA will be expected to comply with Business Partner Gateway Standards. The Information Security Office will coordinate the requirements with the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and the Contracting Organization POC for the supporting contract. Typical connections are by Client VPN or Site to Site VPN. Business Partners may access designated internal VA servers if they are granted a Client VPN account.  A Client VPN requires signing of VA National Rules of Behavior and VPN Rules of Behavior by each approved user of the connection. However if there is a large number of Business Partner users that are approved for this, it may be more efficient to build a Site to Site (STS) VPN with the Business Partner. 
o	Each type of connection (Client or STS) requires that all contractors must have Background Investigations completed (required by FIPS 201) and must participate in the VA Information Security Awareness and VA Privacy training programs. 
o	A Site to Site VPN enables a VA Business Partner to securely access specific resources on the VA WAN.  It does this by establishing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between the Business Partner network and one of the One-VA Internet Gateways.  Traffic that may pass over this connection is limited, so only specific VA and Business Partner systems may communicate with each other. A STS is used only if business needs cannot be met with a Client VPN connection. The Business Partner must support 3DES or AES IPSec encryption. The Business Partner must sign a legal agreement with the VA (MOU/ISA) for a STS. Communication must be limited to explicit VA and Business Partner systems, using a limited set of protocols. A STS requires an Interconnection Security Agreement, used to support a Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A) that establishes the requirements for data exchange between two organizations. The MOU/A is used to document the business and legal requirements necessary to support the business relations between the two organizations.
o	Each of the VA gateways has two Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5540 devices used for Site to Site VPN connections.  They use IP Security (IPSec) with Triple Digital Encryption Standard (3DES) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and ISAKMP for authentication and integrity.  The devices are FIPS-140-2 compliant.  This capability establishes a secure, end-to-end encrypted tunnel that protects the VPN data flows from the Gateway VPN components to all VPN-enabled sites.

<DESC>The Bureau of Fiscal Service, on behalf of the Office of  Financial Research (OFR), under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1)(i), intends to issue a fixed price award to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) to cover a portion of the expenses for a two-day Financial Stability Conference.  

The OFR and FRBC will jointly organize and co-sponsor a two-day Financial Stability Conference on December 3  4, 2015, in the Washington, DC area.   A primary mission of the OFR is to perform applied research and essential long-term research and develop tools for risk measurement and monitoring (Dodd-Frank Act Section 153(a)(3-4)).  The FRBC is uniquely placed to partner with the OFR as one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, comprise the Federal Reserve System.   Among the Federal Reserve Banks, FRBC is the preeminent voice on financial stability research. Like the OFR, FRBC publishes its own research and has a particular focus on financial stability topics.  

The focus of the conference will be topics related to tools and data required to identify, measure and forecast systemic risk.  The OFR and FRBC will contact their respective networks of practitioners, researchers, and academics for participation.  The OFR and FRBC will participate in the review of the papers submitted and jointly approve the papers to be presented.  The two organizations will jointly decide on the structure of the conference, including the panel topics, panelists, invited speakers, and invited guests.  In addition, subsequent to the conference, both parties will review and consider papers for journal publication.

Participation will be by invitation only for approximately 150 individuals including the Board of Governors, invitees from the Federal Reserve Banks, private sector, academics, and other Federal agencies.  The OFR and FRBC will jointly develop the agenda as invited speakers and invited papers are confirmed.

The OFR and FRBC will have the opportunity to connect with regulators, researches, and practitioners across the spectrum of Government, academia, and industry.  OFRs network will be enhanced by bringing together supervisors and academics that have an interest in financial stability monitoring.

The objectives of this collaboration with FRBC are to highlight research and advance the dialogue on macroprudential policy development and implementation and to disseminate recent advances in systemic risk measurement and forecasting tools.

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes. Any other responsible source capable of meeting the requirement may submit technical, pricing, and past performance data sufficient to determine capability. However, the determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government. To be considered, any such documentation must be received no later 2:00 p.m. EST, than November 9, 2015. Only electronic submissions will be accepted and no extensions will be granted.  Responses to this notice shall be emailed to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov ATTN: M. Forbes/L. Stanley.

<a href="mailto:jsc-msoc@mail.nasa.gov">Scott  Stephens</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Mission Systems Operations Contract (MSOC). <P> The nature of the work anticipated under the MSOC may create a situation where there could be the potential for an OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the MSOC. <P> Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the MSOC will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive. <P> 	The contractor will have access to other companies proprietary information, e.g. Commercial Crew and Commercial Cargo Program vendors. <P> 	The contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. <P> The NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is located on the NASA Headquarters Procurement website at: <A HREF="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/OCIGuide.pdf">https://www.hq.nasa.gov/of fice/procurement/OCIGuide.pdf </A>   .  Please reference this document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCI issues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this Request for Information.  Your response is required by 1:00 p.m. local time (CST) on November 19, 2015.  Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: <P> 1.	What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the MSOC contract? <P> 2.	What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. <P> 3.	Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed MSOC contract that were not identified in this RFI? <P> 4.	Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the MSOC that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential MSOC RFP? <P> NASA intends to assess submittals in response to this Request for Information and may provide feedback.  If NASA provides feedback, its response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examine possible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be a confirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror can successfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.	Furthermore, a response in no way alters or interprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to an RFP issued under a solicitation for MSOC.  Subsequent to the initial submission and a potential response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. <P> NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submitted it.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. <P> The Government intends to post the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents to the MSOC Interested Parties List located on the MOSC website (<A HREF="http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/MSOC/">http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/MSOC/ </A>	 ) unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  <P> All questions should be directed to the point of contact identified below.  <P> In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.	The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited under this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and posted on the MSOC website.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />EVENT MONITORING SERVICE FOR NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER SAN DIEGO<br />GENERAL INFORMATION:<br />General Requirements: The effort required hereunder shall be performed in accordance with this Statement of Work and in accordance with all other terms and conditions set forth herein.<br />Scope: The contract dates will be effective immediately upon contract approval for the Fiscal Year of 2016 for the duration of 12 full months, beginning 15-NOV-2015 thru 14-NOV-2016. The contract is for cardiac monitoring services. The contractor is required to provide all services, equipment and material necessary for the Cardiac Monitoring System to ensure dependable and reliable equipment operation. The Contractor shall maintain the equipment within the original manufacturer's specifications, in accordance with Federal, State, and Local laws and regulations, U.S. Navy Regulations, instructions, and Joint Commission requirements.</p>
<p>A cardiac monitoring system is a continuous monitoring system that the patient wears for a period of time to record the electrical rhythm of their heart during activities of daily living. The monitor records the patient ECG and transmits this information to the contracting company. Once the recording period is concluded, the patient will return the cardiac monitor to the company. The contracting company will then provide a report of the total time recorded to the cardiologist. The purpose of this report is to provide information, to the cardiologist, to determine the etiology, treatment and diagnosis of the patient's symptoms. The monitor is the sole property of the contracting company. <br />THE CONTRACTOR /VENDOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:<br />The contracting company will only bill the award contract for completed cardiac monitoring services where the patient has established an &lsquo;ECG Baseline", has completed the specified days required to wear the monitor as recommended by the cardiologist, the monitor has been returned to the contracting company and a full patient report has been complied and is available to be view by our cardiology staff. <br />1. The contractor shall perform the following before the cardiac monitor is issued:</p>
<p>&bull; Contracting company must be FDA approved, HIPPA compliant. <br />&bull; Contracting company will assign a person or persons, to be a point of contact (POC) for NMCSD Cardiology department. This POC will work directly with our cardiology department staff. The contracting company will provide on-site visits, education of products and continued assistance for our staff members. <br />&bull; The contractor will provide all Cardiology Clinic physicians, nurses and technicians accessibility to their website with username and password.<br />&bull; Once the contractor receives online enrollment form from NMCSD, the contracting company will contact the patient, verify their mailing address and contact information before issuing a cardiac monitor. The monitor issued will be the monitor that has been recommended by the cardiologist and will be selected on the online enrollment form. Either 1) wireless/cellular 30-day monitoring service or a 2) 14-day cardiac telemetry monitoring service or a 3) 30-day cardiac telemetry monitoring service. <br />&bull; The contractor will provide the patient, education of the cardiac monitor that has been recommended by the cardiologist and provided additional information the patient has in regards to the monitor. At times, there will be a patient that either does not have a mailing address (PO Box address is not a valid mailing address) or refuse the cardiac monitoring service or they are unable to reach the patient. The POC will provide NMCSD cardiology the information of these patients. <br />&bull; Once the contractor has verified patient address and information, they will have 3 working days to issue the monitoring system to the patient, via Fed-Ex or UPS. <br />&bull; The contractor must provide FDA approved cardiac monitoring systems to the patient. The monitoring system must include all accessories and parts needed for the patient to continue use of the monitor during the recommended days as prescribed by the cardiologist. These accessories and parts are, but not limited to, the monitoring device, all cables, batteries, wires, electrodes, carrying case or clip, instructions on how to set up the monitor and how to return the monitor, a postage paid return mailer. The monitoring device must be free of defects and inspected before it is issued to the patient. In the event the monitor has a defect while the patient is wearing the monitor, the contractor will immediately (within 48 hours) send another monitor device to the patient to avoid interruption of service. In an event where a second monitor has been issued due any defect, the contracting company will only bill for one device. If the patient requires additional accessories and parts, the contractor will provide these to the patient at no additional charge to the patient. NMCSD will not be charged for these additional accessories and parts. <br />&bull; The cardiac monitoring device is the sole property of the contracting company. NMCSD will not purchase or take ownership of these monitors, provide service or maintenance of these monitors and is not responsible or liable for the care or return of these monitors once they have been received by the patient. The contractor assumes all responsible for the retrieval event monitors not returned by the patient. The government, the Naval Medical Center San Diego or Cardiology Clinic shall not be held responsible or liable for contractor owned monitors that are not returned by the patients.<br />&bull; Most contracting companies will have a "notification protocol" established, which is a set of ECG parameters in which to notify the attending cardiology resident. We request to review this "notification protocol" to verify that these parameters will meet our NMCSD standard of care. This "notification protocol" can be modified at any time during the period of performance of the contract by our cardiology provider as needed.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall perform the following during the cardiac monitoring service:</p>
<p>&bull; It is the contractor's responsibility to track the monitoring device to ensure that the patient has received it. If the patient has not contacted the contracting company, the contractor will have 48 hours to contact the patient to assist the patient with setting up monitoring device and to create an "ECG Baseline" via phone connection whereas the ECG is edited and measurement added as well as any interpretation.<br />&bull; The contractor must be available during normal business hours, to answer an equipment monitoring questions the patient may have. <br />&bull; Once a baseline has been established, the contractor will file into their "patient chart" and subsequent ECG report are filed for the duration of the monitoring period. The contractor will create and maintain the patient's record, as per HIPPA and JACHO Standards. <br />&bull; Any arrhythmias that fall within the "notification protocol" (defined by facility or ordering physician) are immediately edited and measured and the patient is requested, by the contractor, to re-record to confirm arrhythmia has abated or is sustained. Patients are encouraged to record and transmit any and all cardiac based symptoms to the contractor within the protocol who will then notify the duty physician, during normal business hours (0630-01600). For after hours, the contractor will contact the on-call cardiology resident. Notify on-call duty physician for critical values immediately at all times. Faxes of critical values are unacceptable.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall perform the following upon completion of the cardiac monitoring service:</p>
<p>&bull; After the patient completes the use of the cardiac monitor they will return the monitor to the contracting company. Included in the service is a postage-paid mailer for them to return the monitor to the contractor. If after 2 working days the contract has not received the monitor, the contractor will contact the patient, who is then advised to return the device with the return mailer provided (postage paid) to the contractor. It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor the distribution of monitors sent to the patient. <br />&bull; Once the monitor has been received by the contractor, the contractor will create a "final report", compiled along with all ECG strip reports no later than 3 working days. NMCSD authorized personnel will be given access to contactor's secure website for "final report" retrieval.<br />&bull; Report should be accessible by authorized personnel through contractor's secure website and downloaded in the form of a PDF for integration into facilities EMR (electronic medical records).</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed throughhttps://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations.<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

1.0	Background/Introduction 
The High Performance Computing (HPC) Team in ITACS at NPS provides overall support to students, staff, and researchers engaged in work that requires high-level computational capacity. This includes massively parallel computation (high floating-point-operations per second usually requiring multi-cores/threads), high input/output rates, and/or big data / data-analytics workloads. Traditional workloads have typically dealt with the MPI (message passing interface) stack employed on CPUs, but over the past few years, has grown to include GPGPU computing, and more recently, Hadoop computing.

<p>Place of Performance:<br />Fort Mifflin<br />6400 Hog Island Rd.<br />Philadelphia, PA 19153-5098</p>
<p>PERIOD of PEFORMANCE: <br />Work to be completed no later than 150 days after date of contract.</p>
<p><br /><br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>SPARES DESIGNATION: MD-09-05-22</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to have a total of fifty (56) ALCO model 251-C marine engine cylinder heads overhauled. Contractor shall provide all labor, parts, materials, equipment and services required to rebuild and overhaul engine cylinder heads in accordance with ALCO specifications MI-11020G, DRP-12200N, and DRP-12400H. It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the publications from FM/ALCO to assure they are using the most current information for the job.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>Prospective vendors should be aware that the ALCO part numbers listed throughout this package were those available to us at the time. The Government realizes that numbers are constantly being revised or superseded, especially with GE/ALCO now being FM/ALCO under Coltec Industries, and now Fairbanks Morse/Alco Engine Div.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to ascertain which parts numbers have been changed and automatically use the newer parts numbers for parts, so long as the part being provided is still the exact same OEM part. If the parts themselves have been altered, then the contractor must notify the Government representative or Contracting Officer. The Contractor is to provide documentation to the origin of all parts used in overhauling the 251-C cylinder heads.</p>
<p>The description provided herein identifies the ALCO 251 style engines used on board the U.S. Army Dredge McFARLAND. The correct rebuilt head is to be determined by written description of parts to be utilized more so then the part number. Much discussion arises from which part numbers are current versus those superseded. Again, the correct unit is to be determined by narrative description more so then part number.</p>
<p>NOTE: The contractor is responsible for shipping charges both for receiving the material to be refurbished, and once the material has been rebuilt and being returned to the Government. The contractor can either make arrangements with his own carrier or have the Government pick a carrier. In either event, the shipping charges shall be collect to the Contractor. Coordination for shipment of the engine heads shall be with Richard Burns, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Mifflin Distribution Center, at 1-215-365-5095.</p>
<p>The contractor is to obtain most current publication copies directly from ALCO to insure latest revisions and changes are utilized.</p>
<p>No engine head will be condemned because of the casting or serial number. It is understood that a newer style head casting have been developed and utilized on some ALCO engines, especially those that run at a much higher speed then those used by the Dredge McFARLAND. For his reason, ALCO has been condemning the older serialized engine heads. The government is not changing out the current Dredge McFARLAND engine heads to the newer style, which required a one-time adapter kit. It is our intent to continue to utilize the older style engine application.</p>
<p>The only reason an engine head casting is to be condemned is because of the lack of rebuilding ability, due to cracks, pitting, corrosion, or test failure. The repair facility must be willing to accept this condition prior to submission of bid or accepting award of the purchase order.</p>
<p>AT THIS TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PURCHASE NEW STYLE HEADS.</p>
<p>Any casting condemned for any reason must be returned to the Government, with a written explanation of why it is being condemned. The casting itself must be marked in an indelibly marking "CONDEMNED". These units are Government property and are to be treated as such, no matter what the condition or status.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP). The purpose of this section is to define performance evaluation procedures. The Surveillance Plan describes what the government will survey. The absence of any contract requirement from the QASP shall not detract from its enforceability nor limit the rights or remedies of the government under any other provision of this contract, including the clauses entitled, "Inspection of Services" and "Default." The government has the right to inspect all services required in the contract.</p>
<p>2.1.1. The Performance Requirement is set forth in Column #1.</p>
<p>2.1.2. The Performance Standard is set forth in Column #2.</p>
<p>2.1.3. The Acceptable Quality Level for each Requirement is set forth in Column #3.</p>
<p>2.1.4. The Surveillance Method and Frequency for each requirement is set forth in Column #4.</p>
<p><br />9.1. GOVERNMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE. Contractor performance will be compared to the Contract Performance Standards and the QASP. The government may use a variety of surveillance methods to evaluate the contractor's performance to determine if it meets the contract standards. The methods used on the contract are:</p>
<p>2.2.1. One Hundred Percent Inspection of the output items.</p>
<p>2.2.2. Periodic Inspection of the processes or output items.</p>
<p>2.2.3. Customer Complaints</p>
<p>2.2.4 Random Sampling</p>
<p>9.2. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. Performance of a service will be an evaluation to determine whether or not it meets the performance threshold of the contract.

Invoices May Be Used To Aid In Verifying Performance In Accordance With The Performance Work Statement. 100% Compliance Proper Documentation Provided Initially and Then Quarterly With COR Observation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.4. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE.</p>
<p>Various methods exist to monitor performance. The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the<br />administration of this QASP.</p>
<p>a. Feedback from Oversight Board<br />b. Feedback from Government Users<br />c. Feedback from Property Book Officers<br />d. Direct Observation<br />e. 100% Inspection<br />f. Review of Quarterly Reports (various)<br />g. Review of Monthly Reports (various)</p>
<p>Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the contractor's task manager or on-site<br />representative when a defect is identified and inform the manager of the specifics of the problem. The COR shall be<br />responsible for monitoring the contractor's performance in meeting a specific performance standard/AQL.</p>
<p>a. DIRECT OBSERVATION. (Can be performed periodically or through 100% surveillance.)</p>
<p>b. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS). (Evaluates outputs through the use of<br />management information reports. Best used for general surveillance and may need to be supplemented<br />by periodic inspections.)</p>
<p>c. PERIODIC INSPECTION. Uses a comprehensive evaluation of selected outputs. Inspections may be<br />scheduled as required.</p>
<p>1) Analysis of contractor's progress reports. (Evaluate cost, schedule, etc.)<br />2) Performance reporting.</p>
<p>Surveillance results may be used as the basis for actions (to include payment deductions) against the contractor. In<br />such cases, the Inspection of Services clause and the Inspection of Supplies clause in the Contract becomes the basis<br />for the KO's actions.</p>
<p>9.5. RATINGS.<br />Metrics and methods are designed to determine if performance exceeds, meets, or does not meet a given standard<br />and acceptable quality level. A rating scale shall be used to determine a positive, neutral, or negative outcome. The<br />following ratings shall be used:</p>
<p>Example 1:<br />EXCEPTIONAL: Performance significantly exceeds contract requirements to the Government's benefit.<br />SATISFACTORY: Performance meets contractual requirements.<br />UNSATISFACTORY: Performance does not meet contractual requirements.</p>
<p><br />10. DOCUMENTING PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>a. ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>The Government shall document positive performance. A report template is attached. Any report may become a<br />part of the supporting documentation for fixed fee payments, award fee payments, or other actions.</p>
<p>b. UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.</p>
<p>When unacceptable performance occurs, the COR shall inform the contractor. This will normally be in writing<br />unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication. In any case the COR shall document the discussion and<br />place it in the COR file.</p>
<p>When the COR determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract<br />Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's task manager or on-site representative. A CDR<br />template is attached to this QASP.</p>
<p>The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing. The CDR will specify if the contractor is required<br />to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and<br />avoid a recurrence. The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective<br />action plan to the COR. The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine<br />acceptability.</p>
<p>Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for contract payment deductions, fixed fee<br />deductions, award fee nonpayment, or other actions deemed necessary by the KO.</p>
<p>11. FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT.</p>
<p>a. Frequency of Measurement.</p>
<p>During contract/order performance, the COR shall take periodic measurements, quarterly as specified in the AQL<br />column of the Performance Standards Summary Matrix, and shall analyze whether the negotiated frequency of<br />measurement is appropriate for the work being performed.<br />b. Frequency of Performance Assessment Meetings.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer<br />conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The<br />following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. BASIS FOR THE AWARD</p>
<p>1.1. This is a competitive requirement for maintenance services consisting of customer support, software updates<br />and upgrades, maintenance. Service shall include all parts, labor, travel, phone support and preventative<br />maintenance visits to USAMRIID.</p>
<p>1.2. The requirement will be evaluated using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source<br />selection process in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 and Army Source Selection Supplement determining if<br />contractor proposal is "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable." A single firm-fixed price (FFP) contract will be established<br />if the offeror has been determined responsible and the technical proposal is determined to be acceptable to the<br />Government, cost/price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>1.3. To receive consideration for award, offerors must achieve an evaluation of not less than "Acceptable" for the<br />Management Approach and Past performance evaluation factors. The non-cost/price evaluation factors are as<br />follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach<br />Factor 2: Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>Government evaluators will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified<br />in the proposal.</p>
<p>2. Evaluation Criteria: (The following criteria will be used to evaluate the non-price aspects of the proposal.)</p>
<p>2.1. Factor 1: Technical Approach : The technical approach will be evaluated to the degree to which the Offeror<br />technical approach demonstrates a clear understanding of all the tasks and how the approach is likely to yield the<br />required results within the required timeframe; the methodology and flexibility that will be used in accomplishing<br />any resultant award; overall ability to perform; The technical approach is creative and reduces cost, technical, or<br />schedule risk to the Government.</p>
<p>2.2. Factor 2: Past Performance : The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based<br />on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance, as well as that of its Subcontractors. This<br />evaluation will consider how each Offeror's past performance relates to the probability of successful<br />accomplishment of the required effort. Past Performance will be evaluated for the Offeror's probability of meeting<br />the solicitation requirements. The Past Performance evaluation will consider the Offeror's demonstrated relevant<br />and recent record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the requirements. A performance<br />confidence assessment rating will be assigned for each Offeror focusing on relevant and recent Past Performance.<br />The Government will review the Past Performance information to determine the quality and usefulness as it applies<br />to performance confidence assessment. The Past Performance risk evaluation will assess the risks associated with<br />an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the PWS requirements indicated by the Offeror's record of past<br />performance on relevant efforts, either included in the proposal or identified by the evaluators in any other manner.<br />In this context, "Offeror" refers to the proposed Prime Contractor and all proposed Subcontractors. The Prime<br />Contractor and proposed Subcontractors will first be assessed individually and the results will then be assessed in<br />their totality to derive the Offeror's Past Performance rating.</p>
<p>2.3. Factor 3 - Price: Price will be evaluated separately from non-price and past performance factors. A price<br />analysis will be performed in order to evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price. The proposed<br />price will be evaluated to ascertain consistency with the level of effort described in the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>3. EVALUATION RATING STANDARDS</p>
<p>3.1. Technical Approach Ratings (excluding Past Performance)<br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Acceptable - Proposal Clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>3.2. Past Performance Ratings<br />Past Performance Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the<br />offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the<br />offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the<br />total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option<br />prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the<br />option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror<br />within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either<br />party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether<br />or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)<br />(End of provision)</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<DESC><p><br />COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a pre-priced blanket purchase agreement (BPA), etc. for commercial items, as described under the paragraph below titled "Requirement."&nbsp; The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. An agreement, if any, will be made with the responsible offeror who submits a proposal that (1) conforms to the requirements of the synopsitation; (2) represents the best value to the Government, prices and factors considered. The Contracting Officer may choose to issue multiple awards. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award at all depending upon (1) the quality of proposals received and (2) the price fair and reasonableness of proposals received.</p>
<p>Synopsitation Number: FA8601-16-A-0001</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 621511</p>
<p>Requirement: The 88 MDG is tasked to perform various lab tests to assist with diagnosing patient maladies. The Government does not have the in house capability to perform all tests required. Services are to be provided in accordance with the Performance Work Statement, which is located at Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 16 Nov 2015 through 15 Nov 2020. The BPA will be written for a period of five (5) years, during which the Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA. Therefore, a BPA does not include a minimum purchase requirement or maximum dollar limitation. The Government is not obligated to make any calls against the BPA, which may be cancelled by the Government or the contractor in accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the BPA Terms of Agreement. For additional information on BPAs refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.303.</p>
<p>All prospective awardees are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Prior to BPA award, your company must be registered with SAM.</p>
<p>All Contractors must also have a DUNS number. The DUNS number is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A DUNS number will be <br />Provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror. For information on obtaining a DUNS number, the offeror, if located within the United States, should call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505. The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;Company name.<br />(2)&nbsp;Company address.<br />(3)&nbsp;Company telephone number.<br />(4)&nbsp;Line of business.<br />(5)&nbsp;Chief executive officer/key manager.<br />(6)&nbsp;Date the company was started.<br />(7)&nbsp;Number of people employed by the company.<br />(8)&nbsp;Company affiliation.</p>

<p>Technical: The Government will review the documentation provided by the offeror and make an assessment of the offeror's ability to perform the services called for in the PWS to the standards specified therein. Notwithstanding any other documentation provided by the offeror, failure to provide the requisite certifications may render an offer ineligible for or award.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate the proposed price of service per hour to determine if the price conforms to the "Specific Instructions to Offerors" above. Not all offers may consist of the same tests and services. The Government will evaluate the prices for the required services to ensure that they are competitive in the commercial marketplace.

<p align="left">Provision 52-212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
</strong>
<p align="left">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p align="left">1) Lowest Price</p>
<p align="left">2) Technically Acceptable</p>
<p align="left">PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p align="left">1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of reasonableness. Price analysis techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p align="left">2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p align="left">i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.</p>
<p align="left">ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price</p>
<p align="left">iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p align="left">TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE: The Government will evaluate offerors technical ability based on Offerors submission of proof of training in the form of certificates or formal documentation of manufacture sponsored training. Award will be made to the responsible offeror who meets minimum technical requirements at the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p align="left">(b) <em>Options. </em>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. If option year price increase is due to economic factor exluding wage increases, please provide supporting documentaion. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p align="left">i. The solicitation and subsequent award for this acquisition contains the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This option to extend the contract term is evaluated as part of the initial evaluation, so that any resultant exercise of this option is within scope of the pending contract. The inclusion of this clause provides up to six (6) months of continued performance when it is in the Government's best interest to continue performance after the end of the final contract performance period. If conditions warrant the exercise of this option, the price(s) for the continued performance under this clause shall be at the same price(s) as the prior performance period.</p>
<p align="left">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p align="left">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p align="left">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p align="left">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p align="left">(A) <em>The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p align="left">(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. </em>A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p align="left">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p align="left">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p align="left">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p align="left">(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p align="left">technical requirements will be achieved.</p>
<p align="left">5. Offeror's proposal shall consist of a cover letter and three (3) separate volumes:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Cover Letter shall include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Small Business Status/Categories as appropriate</p>
<p align="left">Company point of contact with email, phone and facsimile number</p>
<p align="left">Cage Code &amp; DUNS number</p>
<p align="left">A statement that your company understands the requirements specified in the</p>
<p align="left">Performance Work Statement (PWS) and will meet the performance standards and</p>
<p align="left">requirements therein.</p>
<p align="left">A statement that your company does or does not take exception to any of the</p>
<p align="left">requirements of the PWS or terms/conditions of the resulting contract.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume I</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Technical Capability Factor Ratings: The technical rating evaluates the quality of the</p>
<p align="left">offeror's technical solution for meeting the Government's requirement. Technical evaluations</p>
<p align="left">shall utilize</p>
<p align="left">the ratings listed in Table 1.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Table 1. Technical Ratings</p>
<p align="left">Determinati</p>
<p align="left">on</p>
<p align="left">Definition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Acceptable ALL of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. The</p>
<p align="left">offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements</p>
<p align="left">defined in the PWS.</p>
<p align="left">Unacceptable Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. An</p>
<p align="left">unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies. The proposal fails to</p>
<p align="left">meet specified minimum performance and technical capability requirements</p>
<p align="left">defined in the PWS.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume II</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Past Performance evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an</p>
<p align="left">Offeror's recent and relevant past performance, focusing on and targeting performance</p>
<p align="left">which is relevant to the effort, as it directly relates to the work being procured under this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation and recent within three (3) years from the issuance date of this solicitation.</p>
<p align="left">a. The Offeror shall include documentation regarding their relevant past</p>
<p align="left">performance as it clearly relates to the work being procured under this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation. The Offeror shall provide at least three (3) of the most relevant</p>
<p align="left">contracts performed for Federal agencies and/or commercial customers within</p>
<p align="left">the last three (5) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. The</p>
<p align="left">submittal shall include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance and</p>
<p align="left">how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or</p>
<p align="left">similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified by this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation. In the event an Offeror is not able to provide at least three (3)</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performances within the last three (3) years, then the Contracting</p>
<p align="left">Officer shall use an integrated assessment to evaluate past performance. If it</p>
<p align="left">is discovered by the Contracting Officer that an offeror failed to disclose a</p>
<p align="left">relevant contract, the contracting officer may find the offeror nonresponsive.</p>
<p align="left">In your selection of recent and relevant projects/programs, consider the</p>
<p align="left">following:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Recency:</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performance within the last three (3) years from the date of</p>
<p align="left">issuance of this solicitation.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Relevancy</p>
<p align="left">extent of similarity between the service/support effort, complexity, dollar</p>
<p align="left">value, contract type, and the Offeror's role as a subcontractor and/or teaming</p>
<p align="left">partner or other comparable attributes of past performance examples and the</p>
<p align="left">source selection requirements; and a measure of the likelihood that the past</p>
<p align="left">performance is an indicator of future performance.</p>
<p align="left">b. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the</p>
<p align="left">right to use both the information provided in the Offeror's Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past</p>
<p align="left">Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contract</p>
<p align="left">Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Defense Contract</p>
<p align="left">Management Agency (DCMA) or similar systems, and commercial sources.</p>
<p align="left">Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by</p>
<p align="left">Offerors in their proposals may be used by the Government to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough,</p>
<p align="left">complete, and current past performance information as requested in this</p>
<p align="left">paragraph remains with the Offerors. Proposals that do not contain the</p>
<p align="left">information requested, risk rejection.</p>
<p align="left">c. The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's</p>
<p align="left">probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The past performance</p>
<p align="left">evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of</p>
<p align="left">performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's</p>
<p align="left">requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for</p>
<p align="left">each offeror after evaluating the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on</p>
<p align="left">performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">will be evaluated using the following ratings:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Table 1. Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Rating Description</p>
<p align="left">Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a high expectation that</p>
<p align="left">the offeror will successfully perform the required</p>
<p align="left">effort</p>
<p align="left">Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a reasonable</p>
<p align="left">expectation that the offeror will successfully</p>
<p align="left">perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a low expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has no expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will be able to successfully perform the</p>
<p align="left">required effort</p>
<p align="left">Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or</p>
<p align="left">the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no</p>
<p align="left">meaningful confidence assessment rating can be</p>
<p align="left">reasonably assigned</p>
<p align="left">All recent and relevant past performance comments received will be taken into account</p>
<p align="left">and could affect the overall rating. The overall past performance evaluation is a</p>
<p align="left">subjective decision based on the whole of all data received. In the case of an Offeror</p>
<p align="left">without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past</p>
<p align="left">performance is not available, or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can</p>
<p align="left">be reasonably assigned; the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on</p>
<p align="left">past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be</p>
<p align="left">determined to have unknown past performance and be deemed "neutral."</p>
<p align="left">d. Submission Requirements. The offeror shall submit a Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">customer authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the</p>
<p align="left">Offeror's performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet - <strong>(see attachment 6). </strong>The Offeror</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">shall provide documentation outlining the Offeror's past performance with</p>
<p align="left">contracts, as prime, subcontractor, teaming partner, and /or joint venture partner,</p>
<p align="left">which is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being</p>
<p align="left">procured under this solicitation. The submittal shall include rationale supporting</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's assertion of relevance and how it was determined that the work</p>
<p align="left">performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to</p>
<p align="left">the work specified by this solicitation. Offerors are required to explain what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the proposed effort they relate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Past Performance Questionnaire - <strong>(see attachment 3). </strong>For the contracts</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">identified on each Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet, the Offeror shall forward</p>
<p align="left">a copy of the past performance questionnaire to the points of contact responsible</p>
<p align="left">for monitoring performance under such contracts. The points of contact shall</p>
<p align="left">return the questionnaires via email <em>directly </em>to the Contract Specialist (Mr. John</p>
<p align="left">Porter) not later than the solicitation due date. Any questionnaires not returned</p>
<p align="left">directly to the Government point of contact (Mr. John Porter) will not be reviewed</p>
<p align="left">and evaluated. It is the Offerors responsibility to ensure questionnaires are</p>
<p align="left">provided to the Government point of contract (Mr. John Porter) on or before the</p>
<p align="left">due date. The information contained in the questionnaires will be used to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume III</p>
<p align="left">Cost/Price will be evaluated for reasonableness, balance and completeness. Since this is</p>
<p align="left">a Firm Fixed Price contract, the Government will not evaluate supporting cost data unless</p>

LCS project notice and required documents.<br /><br />This solicitation is being conducted under the Logistics Cost Sharing (LCS) program and will result in a contract between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the contractor.

QUOTES/OFFERS ARE DUE November 5th, 2015 at 1:00 pm eastern standard time (EST). Only electronic offers (email) will be accepted. Submit quotes to Janica Francis-Hunter, NCO 7 Contract Specialist e-mail Janica.Francis@va.gov.  All offers must include the solicitation number.

2) Could you please confirm the areas that need maintenance, is the whole block that the building is on to be maintained; the area around the building, parking lots, and area opposite the building across the parking lots? Everything around the building and the paved parking area.

3) Who is the current contractor and how much was the award amount? This is a new requirement. The service has never been rendered and no previous contract for this service has been awarded. 

4) Can you clarify what we will be spraying? Spraying for weeds.

5) Are you requesting a weed killer applied once only per season or spraying once a year for pests (ants)? Should be once a year for a general weed spraying in February to include pre-emergent treatment and then as needed for post emergent weeds. Insecticide should be applied quarterly (October, January, April, July) around the perimeter of the building. And treat other pests as needed such as fire ant mounds. 
 
6) Can you provide a map of the location, and do you have the amount of acres that needs to be cut. Please see below

 


7)  Who is the current contractor that's providing the services? This is a new requirement for this service. 

8) What was the value of the last option year's contract? This is a new requirement for this service.

9) Can you please provide the acreage that is included in this grounds maintenance contract? Using Google Maps I have calculated that the entire property is approximately 1.86 acres, if you take out the parking lot, there is approximately 1.21 acres of lawn and building. Taking out the building leaves about 0.9 acres of lawn and flower beds that will require attention. Please note that these figures are calculated using Google Maps.

10) I would like to know the total acres that will be serviced by my company if we get this contract. Using Google Maps I have calculated that the entire property is approximately 1.86 acres, if you take out the parking lot, there is approximately 1.21 acres of lawn and building. Taking out the building leaves about 0.9 acres of lawn and flower beds that will require attention. Please note that these figures are calculated using Google Maps.

11) It appears that there is a vacant lot attached to this property. Is it included in the lawn maintenance or is just the area surrounding the building and parking lot?  The vacant lot is not our property and is not included.

12) Will there be a site visit or can you provide a site map that is to scale, showing the detail of all of the areas that is to service in terms of acreage or square footage? Google map link for the MB CBOC:

https://www.google.com/maps/place/3381+Phillis+Blvd,+Myrtle+Beach,+SC+29577/@33.6716066,-8.9363389,194m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x89006a1bdbeef365:0x11ef9384c8abba7d!6m1!1e1 

13) According to the scope of work and the pricing sheet, there is only one job that is required for pruning services that is to be completed per contract year. But in the service description for mowing, it requires the "trimming of bushes" to be performed on a more frequent basis. What is the government's expectation for these required services listed in the scope of work? Pruning service is for the Palm Trees. Bushes should be trimmed as needed on a regular basis.

14) How many services are expected during the months of October - February? There are no mowing services to be performed during this time only basic weeding, trimming of bushes, cleaning out flower beds, removing and replacing any dead plants and flowers; edging sidewalks, cleaning and clearing parking lot of debris as needed.

The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp
If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. 
For a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor.

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT<br /><br />Autonomous Unmanned Systems Teaming and Collaboration In GPS Denied Environments (AUSTC)<br /><br />NAICS: 541330<br /><br />Response Date: November&nbsp;6th 2015<br /><br />The Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny, is seeking information on the availability and technical capability of all sources to provide the required product services for Autonomous Unmanned Systems Teaming and Collaboration In GPS Denied Environments (AUSTC). <br />Required Capabilities: Autonomous Unmanned Systems Teaming and Collaboration In GPS Denied Environments (AUSTC), will identify, invest, mature, and transition revolutionary/game-changing autonomous unmanned sensing technologies. The AUSTC program employs a "think-tank" and modified "skunk-works" approach to identify and determine best path forward for new and game-changing technologies that may be available or in development to achieve US Army RDECOM-ARDEC interest Sensitive Target Site Exploitation (STSE) mission.<br /><br />The Government's objective is to develop, demonstrate and assess the relevant critical AUSTC technology elements of reliable and accurate autonomous unmanned systems sensing. ARDEC and other sponsored program objectives will be to conduct analysis and assessments with technology demonstration efforts to determine the technical risks and the system integration requirements of existing (previously developed) autonomous unmanned systems sensing technologies and/or the design and development of new autonomous unmanned systems sensing technologies to expand the capabilities of GPS Denied (GD) autonomous unmanned systems sensing and collaborating architecture and related components necessary for today's GD target defeat system platforms. The precision GD mapping, localization, target detection, tracking and collaboration capabilities are a requirement for today's GPS denied autonomous unmanned systems sensing system technologies but also open a unique pathway that allows for new methods of sensing both existing and emerging threats. ARDEC is seeking to further refine and develop this AUSTC technology to meet additional operational requirements and threat gaps to further enhance their capability and achieve RDECOM-ARDEC STSE mission interest. A contractual system prototype is needed to provide support capability for the design, development, testing of these concepts, components and technologies. The purpose of this market research is to provide that contractual vehicle.<br /><br />This Offeror will provide wide variety of operational and engineering services, hardware and software development in support of existing and new AUSTC technologies and their associated components for testing and integration. These requirements include, but are not limited to: all aspects of design, development, prototyping, testing and deployment of AUSTC technology for situational awareness (SA), collaboration and engagement. The offeror shall be able to perform coding, analysis, testing, produce and process data in a secured environment. AUSTC technologies systems shall solve the present issues such as autonomy, 3D/4D mapping, localization, identification of target, tracking, collective 3D visualization, advanced real-time analysis framework, GD environment radio communication network, target engagement and collaboration. Requirements for such items shall include (but not be limited to) design and development of unmanned systems, components, prototype and development of unmanned systems, sensing and their respective components, prototype and development of GD environment radio communication network, sensing that may transform into Unmanned Autonomous System (UAS) including Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV), Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) and Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), prototype, development of items in support of GD STSE missions, operations, testing of components, complete systems and prototype development of UAS platforms in support of lightweight and/or advanced systems (or subsystems) for unmanned vehicles. <br /><br />Additionally to provide RDECOM-ARDEC with services to meet conventional programmatic engineering and technical support requirements and to provide Subject Matter Expertise (SME) and engineering support services for integration of sensors and UAS systems technologies. This vehicle will investigate, develop, prototype concepts for AUSTC technologies systems, which are needed by the US Army and DoD to expand the present STSE mission capabilities of the warfighter in GD environment. To date, such systems are inaccurate, heavy and expensive. Some of the UAS systems (presently GD SUAV are not autonomous) are required to be autonomous. The current GD UAS systems can also be heavy and expensive as well.<br /><br />The responses shall include, but not be limited to: <br />Business name and address; <br />Name of company representative and their business title; <br />Type of Business; <br />Cage Code; <br />An executive summary of the party's experience and capabilities to meet the required services.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requires engineering and mechanical services to retrofit the HVAC system and complete related tasks in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building in Kihei, Maui Island, Hawaii (Maui County).  

The Kealia Pond Headquarters/Visitor Center Building is a fairly new building. Construction was completed and the building was initially occupied in February 2012. The Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) system in the building is a central station air handling unit with (4) 6-ton fan cooling units and (1) 1-ton fan cooling unit along with air cooled water chillers manufactured by the Trane Company.  The climate in Hawaii is humid particularly in the winter months when the temperatures are cooler and the precipitation levels increase. The building is located in a wetland area downwind of agricultural operations and near the ocean, and recently surface mold has been found on internal walls.

Magnitude of project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  Period of performance is 180 days from issuance of notice to proceed. Proposals that exceed $150,000.00 and that do not include a twenty (20) percent bid bond of the total price quoted with their proposal submission will be considered nonresponsive.  The successful awardee will be asked to provide a 100 percent payment and performance bond within 15 days of award.  Project is unrestricted to any size businesses.  Applicable NAICS code is 238220.  Small business size is defined as $15 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  

Site Visit - Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, November 3, 2106 at 10 AM local time.  If attending the site visit please contact Courtney Brown at office phone (808) 268-6316 and directions will be provided on where contractors will meet.   Questions from the site visit need to be email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov by close of business Thursday, November 5, 2016.  Those questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment the following week.  

Scope of Work:  The Contractor shall provide engineering and installation services to modify the HVAC system in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building.  More specifically the Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and materials necessary to complete the listed tasks.  This includes three base tasks: Install electric reheat per construction drawings provided, move two outside air intakes, and modify building controls & Graphical User Interface (GUI) Graphics. Five separately priced options may be awarded based on government need and available resources. Option 1: design and install Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) fans in the four AH units with the electric reheat coils, Option 2: design and add 15kW of solar panels & appurtenances to existing PV system, Option 3: clean ducts, Option 4: One Year HVAC Maintenance Services Contract, Option 5: design and add chiller hot side coil reheat if feasible.  In conjunction with the requirements of the basic contract, the Contractor shall procure and install any new equipment, service disconnects, power cable runs, and/or distribution panels as necessary to meet current National Electrical Code (NEC) and National Electrical Safety standards.  

No government equipment or materials shall be provided during the contract unless arranged and agreed upon prior to use with the Refuge Manager. Normal duty hours are Monday through Friday 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. Work shall be performed during these hours unless prearranged with the Refuge Manager.  Federal holidays not included.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>HHS-NIH-NCI-SS-ETSB-1028-27</p>
<p>This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SS).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business;  HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 621999. The small business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Contact Center, also known as NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS), was established in 1975 and is a federally funded program that is an essential part of NCI's cancer education and information efforts. The first call the Contact Center took was in early 1976.   This project is for the re-competition of contract HHSN261201000004C with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Prior to the current contract, NCI's CIS Contact Center operated concurrently through 4   competitively awarded five-year contracts. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this support is to provide scientifically based, unbiased information to patients, their families and friends, physicians and other health professionals, and the general public about all aspects of cancer including: cancer research and clinical trials, cancer prevention, risk factors, symptoms, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, living with cancer, and tobacco and cessation counseling and information.</p>
<p>The NCI Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) coordinates and manages the Institute's interaction with the public (including patients, friends and family), researchers, and the media.  OCPL informs the public and the media about the Institute's research activities and scientific advances.  OCPL also works closely with NCI scientists and partner organizations to design and develop effective methods to reach diverse audiences and to meet their needs for the latest, evidence-based cancer information.</p>
<p>The NCI's CIS is an important component of the agency's communications enterprise and supports the NCI mission in numerous ways.  The NCI Contact Center:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serves as the voice of the NCI to the public<br />&bull;	Supports clinical trials recruitment and NCI's clinical trials initiatives<br />&bull;	Impacts health behavior by providing accurate, credible and evidence-based cancer and smoking cessation information</p>
<p>NCI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small businesses concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein.  Based on the responses received from this SBSS notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /> <br />Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The project requires the contractor to manage the following scope of work in support of the NCI Contact Center: <br />&bull;	Cancer information (in English and Spanish) along the cancer continuum<br />&bull;	Clinical trials information and recruitment<br />&bull;	Information about NCI and its programs, priorities, and activities<br />&bull;	Smoking cessation counseling and information</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be performed by the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1.	Provide client-centric cancer and smoking cessation information to meet client needs across all access channels. Current channels include:   (a) telephone, (b) e-mail, (c) LiveHelp (online chat service), and (d) community engagement via social media accounts.</p>
<p>2.	Manage personnel, financial, and material resources to ensure that all contract requirements are met and high-quality service is provided to the public.</p>
<p>3.	Develop, implement and evaluate the training for NCI Contact Center Staff. Training includes: 1) Initial Training; 2) Continuing Education (CE); and, 3) Coaching and mentoring sessions.</p>
<p>4.	Collect data routinely and on an ad-hoc basis using only NCI-approved data collection tools and systems and complete Electronic Contact Record Form (ECRF) for each contact at the time of the inquiry.</p>
<p>5.	Provide adequate facilities for the operation of the Contact Center and the operation of contract activities.  The Contractor will provide necessary office space, furniture and equipment (except where noted in the contract), workstations, resources, and supplies to carry out all activities of the contract.  The NCI Contact Center will be arranged to provide a suitable working environment and to facilitate effective communication and supervision.  The office layout will include area(s) for private conversations and coaching sessions, conference calls, and meetings. This also includes assuring the security of facilities used to conduct the work of the contract and the security of all Government-furnished equipment and systems.</p>
<p>6.	Conduct pilot projects and develop potential health communication research projects or activities.  Any pilot projects or health communication research projects and activities will support NCI's research mission and priorities.</p>
<p>7.	Provide PCs with Microsoft Office software in a version that is compatible with the multiple Government-supplied systems to be used to operate the Contact Center. Work in partnership with IT and Telecommunications Systems providers selected by the Government to ensure optimal Contact Center operations.</p>
<p>8.	Communicate regularly with NCI in support of ongoing contract tasks, including quarterly presentations to members of OCPL Leadership.  In addition, the Contractor will provide communications support to NCI Divisions, Offices, and Centers (DOCs).</p>
<p>9.	Maintain training and other materials used to support the operations of the Contact Center (e.g., knowledge base entries, standard responses, business rules, quality tools, and other standard operating procedures).</p>
<p>10.	Create reports and maintain an organizational structure for the reports by type and date in an electronic format accessible by the Government. Prior to the creation and delivery of the reports, the Contractor will coordinate with the Government report formats, data elements, naming conventions, content, and delivery methods.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of options, for this proposed acquisition is December 1, 2016 - November 30, 2021.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought:</p>
<p>Small businesses possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements and level of effort are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform the required services.

These testers are to be used to supply and control air pressure and flow to the aircraft cabin, cabin seals, and Environmental Control Systems (ECS) components on U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. The desired CPLTs must have the capability of providing continuous air flow of at least 10 PSIG and 235 SCFM to a sealed aircraft cabin/cockpit, as well as simultaneously providing continuous air flow of at least 35 PSIG and 1.0 SCFM to maintain air pressure in aircraft cabin/canopy seal. The CPLTs must also be equipped with appropriate instrumentation (i.e. flow meters, pressure and temperature gauges, controls, etc.) to verify that the aircraft cabin, seals, and ECS components are functioning properly. The desired testers must be designed for storage and operation outdoors in varying environmental conditions such as high and low temperatures, salt, fog, humidity. Additionally, the testers must be mobile, self-contained, and air transportable. Design dimensions, weight, and the projected unit cost are requested.
