<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure services on a sole source basis from University Corporation For Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), Ann Arbor, Minnesota.  The purpose of the proposed work is to develop a more robust, deeper understanding of the use of high performance Internet connectivity by the Health Care/Health Sciences community--with emphasis on critical incidents of usage where the user (individual, group, or organization) reports notable success or failure, with significant positive or negative impacts, and explains why and what remedial actions (if needed) were taken.  The work will apply the Critical Incident Methodology developed in the 1980s and previously used by NLM to better understand physician use of the MEDLINE database.  The methodology will be refined through two focus groups, and then applied in two rounds of interviews with representative users from a cross-section of health care/science institutions.  The study will be exploratory in nature, with an emphasis on brainstorming and open-ended semi-structured interviews that encourage flexibility to accommodate new ideas and perspectives.  The results of the interviews will be analyzed using the critical incident framework to develop a taxonomy of critical incidents, a series of synopsized mini-case studies, a correlation between perceived and actual levels of Internet connectivity at select sites, and a baseline for possible future work. The work will consist of three phases--Phase I, Plan, Conduct, and Analyze Focus Groups; Phase II--Plan, Conduct, and Analyze First Round of Interviews; and Phase III--Plan, Conduct, and Analyze Second Round of Interviews. NLM staff conducted searches of the web and high bandwidth Internet-related web sites in particular, and made inquiries of persons and organizations familiar with this market.  NLM staff determined that the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development/Internet2 was the only vendor able to meet all of the requirements listed above.  UCAID/Internet2 is the leading collaborative organization with regard to U.S. research university high bandwidth Internet applications, has given a priority to Internet connectivity monitoring and evaluation (as manifested by its end-to-end Internet performance initiative), has broad knowledge of both high end Internet applications and performance evaluation methods and metrics, and has access to the requisite combination of technical, application, and focus group/interview skills and experience necessary to provide the requisite services.  Any other source would not be able to meet NLM?s needs. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner in which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02-184/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, announces its intention to award a sole source purchase order to Jack Faucett and Associates (JFA) for approximately $48,000 to modify our existing Manpower Model for Alaska. The period of performance would be from award through December 31, 2002. The Manpower Model was created in IMPLAN for "equitable sharing" analyses and for Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Jack Faucett Associates (JFA) has provided MMS with draft first-step models for OCS oil activities in the Arctic and the Sub-Arctic OCS areas off Alaska (Arctic IMPAK and Sub-Arctic IMPAK) and is close to completing the final versions of the models.  Due primarily to qualitative changes in the Exploration & Development (E&D) scenarios that provide inputs for the models, MMS intends to award this sole source requirement. Services to be provided: the proposed contractor developed the IMPLAN version of the Manpower Model for Arctic and Sub-Arctic OCS activities. Under this order, they would extend the existing model to 1) provide the ability to incorporate drilling structures in the E&D scenario that were not required in the draft version of Arctic IMPAK (e.g., mobile exploration gravity platforms or exploration drill ships instead of ice islands); and 2) "rule-of-thumb" expenditure and allocation estimates for natural gas-related activities in the Hope Basin (Arctic IMPAK), Cook Inlet (Sub-Arctic IMPAK), and more remote Sub-Arctic areas. JFA's intimate familiarity with the Manpower Model from its previous work on the Arctic OCS activities with MMS makes it the logical choice to continue this work. JFA is the only firm possessing the technical knowledge, expertise, and familiarity with the model to successfully complete this work. Any firm seeking to compete for this requirement would have to demonstrate an equal familiarity with IMPLAN and the Manpower Model. Firms that believe they can provide the required items and services described above should identify themselves in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such firms must submit supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes. Inquiries will only be accepted by fax at (703) 787-1387. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for 20 Proto Multiplexer-Demultiplexers (MDMs), 12 MDM Input Output Platforms (MIOPs), and associated circuit cards.  The International Space Station (ISS) Software Integration Laboratory (ISIL) consists of a series of MDMs strung together in a unique rig that represents the avionics components of the ISS.  During the last few years, ISS management has embarked in an enhancement of the ISIL.  The main feature of this enhancement is the change of all Functional Equivalent Unit (FEU) MDMs with Proto MDMs of a much higher fidelity.  The Proto MDMs also require a MIOP so that it can interface with the Real Time Input Output Platform (RTIOP).  This procurement is to purchase the required parts to complete the enhancement of the ISIL.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Honeywell, Space Systems Glendale, under the authority of FAR Part 6, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.   No other sources have been identified for this product.  The ISS MDMs and MIOPs are unique end items that would not provide a new supplier with an adequate business base given the limited business opportunity.  Honeywell designed and built all of the MDM types in use on board the ISS and those used for software development, integraton and testing.  They also designed and built all MDM and MIOPs provided for the ISIL.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  See note 22.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration plans to award a Purchase Order to TA Instruments to purchase a Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) to measure fundamental rheological properties (the complex modulus and the myriad derived parameters) of asphalts, mastics, and modified binders used in asphalt pavements.  The TA Instruments brand DSR has  Smart Swap Technology.  This is a uniquely patented system that allows change of temperature control options, required for different kinds of DSR measurements, while maintaining the necessarily very precise locations of the various sample holders used in the different temperature ranges.  This time saving technology is imperative to FHWAs mission.  TA Instruments is the only known source that provides a DSR with the Smart Swap Technology.  Therefore, no other known source is available to provide the necessary rheometer.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the award date is on or before August 14, 2002.

<CONTACT>Jayne Faris, Contracting Officer, Phone 505 846 5935, Fax 505 846 7049, Email Jayne.Faris@Kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Spacecraft Technology Division, Space Electronics and Protection Branch, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source, follow-on contract to Northrop Grumman for the following described efforts based on technology developed and demonstrated by Northrop Grumman under previously awarded open competition.

BACKGROUND: The Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting System (MSTRS) program provides for research, development, and demonstration of satellite radio frequency threat reporting technologies. Northrop Grumman solely designed, fabricated, and integrated the prototype phase I MSTRS radio frequency receiver hardware and associated software with the exception of a Los Alamos National Laboratory developed single electronic snapshot circuit board and a MIJI software algorithm. Northrop Grumman designed, fabricated, and integrated the MSTRS system that is manifested and installed for flight on shuttle flight STS-107, significantly participated in the design of the MSTRS shuttle experiment, and partially completed the design of a miniaturized phase II receiver system.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to: 1) provide engineering support for the MSTRS prototype phase I risk reduction shuttle experiment. This engineering support will include developing MSTRS tune tables and operating MSTRS ground command and data processing stations; 2) perform data analysis of the MSTRS phase I prototype shuttle experiment data and evaluation of MSTRS performance; and 3) complete prototype phase I development by developing user manuals, system demonstrations, and writing technical reports.

The period of performance for the above tasks is 36 months with an anticipated start date of October 2002. A contract will be awarded to Northrop Grumman provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A draft program plan as well as resumes of key personnel must also be included in the response. Responses are limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Submit responses to Maj Jayne Faris, Det 8 PKVE, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 day of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. It is anticipated that a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, with a classification level of Top Secret is required during the performance of this effort. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors, primarily during the proposal development phase of this negotiated acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel in the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions. Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first communicate with the Contracting Officer. In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact the Ombudsman at the Phillips Research Site of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Mr. Eugene DeWall, Director of Contracting, at (505) 846-4979, or at 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

The Laboratory of Pathology requires a purification system to study individual properties of proteins.  In order to meet the challenges of post genome, the NCI has established a proteomics research effort in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration(FDA), utilizing use of mass spectroscopy, laser capture micro dissection, and diseased and normal tissue samples to identify proteins and second messenger system which are essential to the pathogenesis of Cancer.  Proteins and pathways identified by the proteomics initiative will be an important target for molecular therapeutic intervention.  In order to fully understand and elucidate proteins identified by the proteomics effort as being essential to the pathogensis of disease, an efficient protein expression system and purification scheme and a detailed study of the protein's structure is required.  In order to purify recombinant proteins, the LP must utilize liquid chromatographic systems capable of accommodating both organic and aqueous media, and capable of operating under medium and high-pressure conditions, as necessitated by the resins utilized in purification. Amersham Bioscences is the only source known to the Government that can provide a single instrument which can perform the above functions, and is a leader in resins and columns used for medium and large scale protein purification, and has the widest and most robust selection of resins commonly used for this purpose.  These resins and columns must be compatible with an existing FPLC/HPLC used to drive the purification.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the governments requirement herein. Capability statements must be recieved in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on August 8, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commerical item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discertion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS Code: 334513, business size standard is 500 employees.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NOI2083 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-08.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisitions procedures with Geo-logistics of Alexandria, VA for the air shipment of approximately 6,000 lbs. of laboratory materials to the Rakai District of Uganda.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 481219 and the small-business size standard is $6,000,000.  The International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) is supporting the continuing research efforts of the Rakai Project in Uganda.  The Rakai Project, established in 1988, is a research and training collaboration between the Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry of Health; researchers at Makerere University in Kampala, Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University; and intramural scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Project operates in the rural Rakai District in Southwestern Uganda, and has established one of the largest HIV and reproductive health population-based cohorts in the world.   Currently, the cohort population is approximately 12,000 persons aged 15-49, residing in 50 rural communities.  The project performs many research activities including HIV and STDs (HSV-2, HPV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomona, bacterial vaginosis/BV), including effects on pregnancy, fertility, infant survival, placental pathology and mother-to-child HIV transmission.  To aide in this project, we are sending approximately 6,000 lbs. of laboratory materials to the Rakai Project.  The items are needed now and waiting the additional six (6) months that sea and land-based shipping would take is not an option. Geo-Logistics has been shipping this material for the Rakai Project for the last eight (8) years.  No shipment has ever been lost or damaged and all shipments have arrived on time. Therefore, to avoid the introduction of variables that could introduce time-consuming delays that might ultimately jeopardize the success of the aforementioned project, we are negotiating this acquisition on a sole-source basis.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items.  Offers must be submitted not later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, August 30, 2002.  For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB; 6700B Rockledge Drive; MSC 7605, Room 1130; Bethesda, MD  20892-7605.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Guy Baratte at (301) 594-5075.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the research, development and critical examination of concepts for smart sensing and communication systems that could either form the distributed sensing function of a smart skin or be deployed for structural monitoring on an Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) agent.  In particular, the project will concentrate on the development of sensors and measurement techniques for evaluation of deformation and damage conditions (for example: bond degradation, bond strength and fatigue) and the development of telecommunication technologies and strategies to facilitate interrogation and interaction with and between sensors, and of intelligent signal processing.  This requirement is for a four-month base period and two option periods.  The first option period will be six months in length and the second option will be for two months. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization - Telecommunications and Industrial Physics Division (CSIRO-TIP) who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  CSIRO-TIP's approach includes a unique coupling of remote bond strength sensing with advanced telecommunications techniques.  SCIRO-TIP is unique in its world leading expertise relating to both these areas.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 12 August 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>The Department of Transportation's TASC Acquisition Services plans to award a non-competitive purchase order to the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) of Research Triangle Park, NC, on behalf of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).  The purpose of the project is to conduct a study entitled "Methods for Data Quality Assessment and Measurement." The purpose of the study is to obtain independent outside expertise to ensure that the BTS statistical methodology for assessing data quality represents the state of the art, and that any ratings and measures of data quality derived from the assessments are both appropriate for Federally disseminated information and statistically accurate and reliable.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics believes that NISS is the only organization with the unique combination of strengths to conduct this study, such as these listed: (1) As a National institute, NISS has unique access to the US statistics, mathematics, and scientific communities, and has extensive contacts as well in the social and policy sciences.  Its extreme breadth enables it to address a wide range of problems in the development of new theory and methodology; (2) NISS has a focus on data quality with an emphasis on Federal statistics.  It has proven experience and accomplishments in areas that are tied closely to data quality, including data confidentiality and data integration; (3) NISS is widely recognized and respected in the statistical community.  It was established by national statistical organizations (including the American Statistical Association) and the Research Triangle Universities. Its affiliates include major government statistical agencies (e.g. the Census Bureau, BLS, NCES, NIST), and major university departments of statistics, and (4) NISS has a strong record of success in cross-disciplinary research, especially in areas such as data quality, characterized by complex, ill-structured problems.  It is the only organization in the country with the explicit mission of catalyzing new areas of cross-disciplinary research.

The results of the proposed analysis shall ensure that the most qualified and experienced personnel are recruited and retained to work as observers. In Phase I of the project, APO shall assess current hiring practices and identify methods to improve recruitment of qualified observers and identify methods to ensure and increase retention of experienced observers. APO shall gather information from current and past NMFS Observer Program staff as well as current and past private contractors who provide or have provided observer services to the NMFS. Based upon the results of Phase I, NMFS has the option to renew this purchase order to complete the tasks identified in Phase II, if it is mutually agreed upon by the contractor and the NOAA requesting official. This is a notice of intent with no solicitation package available.Award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biochemistry (LB), plans to procure from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594, the upgrading of an existing Zeiss LSM 510 Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope to a LSM 510 with 30 mW Argon laser, 1 mW HeNe laser, 5 mW HeNe laser and META spectral scanner.  The laser scanning microscope (LSM) will be used to collect optical sections of fluorescent specimens including visualizing immunofluorescence in tissue culture cells and tissue whole mounts, capturing time lapse movies of cells expressing proteins tagged with various fluorescent markers,  and monitoring cell physiology with fluorescent indicator dyes. Various LB laboratories will use the upgraded system to continue ongoing studies including localization of replication proteins in bacteria, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, and cell cycle studies projects. Since the LB is a multi-user environment it is imperative that the upgrade contain the following features:  1) each detector is equipped with its own pinhole for the possibility of simultaneous scanning with identical slice thickness;  2) full 360 degree scan rotation, scan zoom (up to 40x) and offset with no x/y stage centering; 3) digital scan control will allow for the following hardware/software functionality:  constant scanning velocity for all speeds, even illumination along scanning fields with identical pixel conditions, short fly back time (less than 2% of frame cycle), on-line modification of scanning and detector settings, on-line histogram and lut's for optimization, sample preservation via beam blanking only in regions of interest and FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching); 4)  the system must be capable of scanning at least 0.3 msec or 2600 lines per second;  5) on-line ratioing imaging between channels for high speed FRET correction;  6)  comprehensive physiology software for FRAP, FRET and trigger output for precisely controlled synchronization of signaling;  7)  multi tracking capability via digital scan control, which allows high speed multiplexing of excitation wavelengths by line to get rid of cross talk between channels;  8) single button control to implement identical system conditions from previously collected images;  9)  a spectral scanner that incorporates a 32 channel PMT using a grating for high speed and electronic switching between spectral separated detector elements; 10) spectral characterization of multi-labeled specimens with at least 10 nm resolution;  11) 80 nm of spectral information pixel by pixel in single pass of the laser over the specimen;  12)  rapidly generate spectral curve using a lambda stack that can collect pixel by pixel 12 bit up to 2KX2K;  13)  achieve the same kinetic rate for z+ lambda stacks as sell as z, time, and lambda stacks and 14)  allow high speed selection of wavelenght range, including quick and easy switching between overlapping band pass channels.  This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that can upgrade the current Zeiss system to a system that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 p.m. EDT, on August 6, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issues its opinions in written form. Sixth Circuit Judges, Federal Judges, Magistrate Judges and Bankruptcy Judges within the Circuit, other courts and court units, the practicing bar, and the general public require copies of the court's decisions. The court issues approximately 425 to 450 multi-page opinions per year. To meet this need, the court arranges to have its opinions copied and mailed to its subscribers in booklet form. Because of the great demand among judges and the participating bar to review the court's decisions in slip opinion form promptly upon issuance, the court has traditionally contracted with a copier to produce the volume of opinions required in a timely fashion.  Also, because of the importance and wide dissemination of opinions, the court requires that the finished documents be of high quality. 

     In order to produce the finished product, "impressions" will need to be made of the original opinion. The exact number of impressions will vary from opinion to opinion, however, the Government has estimated that over the life of the contract, a median of eleven (11) 8.5" x 11" impressions will be required for each opinion copy booklet. The impressions are then to be collated, stapled, and folded to form booklets with 8.5" x 5.5" pages with text printed on front and back. The contractor shall also provide transportation, handling, and related services necessary to pick up the original slip opinion(s) at the Court in Cincinnati and deliver the finished opinion copy booklets back to the court in 24 hours(there may be more than one original slip opinion issued on any given day). (NOTE: The court's requirements do not allow for electronic transmission of opinions between the court and the contractor.) Finally, the successful contractor will provide the services necessary to maintain a subscriber list, furnish and prepare labels, prepare envelopes, and package and mail opinion copy booklets to court-designated subscribers.
     To request the solicitation, send an email to peter_bouker@ao.uscourts.gov.  Include in your email request, your street address (no P.O. Box numbers please), and your phone and fax numbers.  It is estimated the solicitation will be released sometime in mid August 2002. The response date in this notice is the date by which you must request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Laboratory of Pathology requires a purification system to study individual properties of proteins.  In order to meet the challenges of post genome, the NCI has established a proteomics research effort in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration(FDA), utilizing use of mass spectroscopy, laser capture micro dissection, and diseased and normal tissue samples to identify proteins and second messenger system which are essential to the pathogenesis of Cancer.  Proteins and pathways identified by the proteomics initiative will be an important target for molecular therapeutic intervention.  In order to fully understand and elucidate proteins identified by the proteomics effort as being essential to the pathogensis of disease, an efficient protein expression system and purification scheme and a detailed study of the protein's structure is required.  In order to purify recombinant proteins, the LP must utilize liquid chromatographic systems capable of accommodating both organic and aqueous media, and capable of operating under medium and high-pressure conditions, as necessitated by the resins utilized in purification. Amersham Bioscences is the only source known to the Government that can provide a single instrument which can perform the above functions, and is a leader in resins and columns used for medium and large scale protein purification, and has the widest and most robust selection of resins commonly used for this purpose.  These resins and columns must be compatible with an existing FPLC/HPLC used to drive the purification.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the governments requirement herein. Capability statements must be recieved in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on August 8, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commerical item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discertion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Customs Service is seeking submission of industry comments for the following Statement of Objectives (SOO):


NATIONAL PRIME INTEGRATION CONTRACT PROGRAM
INTEGRATED LOGISTICS and OPERATIONS

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

INTRODUCTION

This Statement Of Objectives (SOO) describes the basic objectives of the U.S. Customs Service National Prime Integration Contract for Integrated Logistics and Operations support for Customs inventory of High Technology Enforcement Equipment (HTEE) and is provided in lieu of a written Government Statement Of Work (SOW). This approach provides potential offeror?s the flexibility to develop scalable cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to satisfy the stated objectives. 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Customs Service has deployed over 6,500 technically complex and high value inspection devices throughout the land border crossings, airports and seaports of the United States. These devices, employing a variety of technologies, are tools to enforce compliance with all U.S. laws associated with persons and goods entering and leaving the country.  THESE DEVICES ARE WAR FIGHTING DEVICES AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. The end user of the devices is the uniformed Customs Officer and the devices themselves are categorized as crew-served and individual.  Crew-served devices require more than one operator, individual devices require only one operator. The HTEE devices were manufactured by companies such as SAIC, AS&E, CSECO, Rapiscan, Olympus, Leica, etc. Maintenance is currently provided by the OEMs for their respective products via a variety of contractual instruments and by 10 technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service whose permanent duty stations are field locales. Training of Customs Officers is being provided by the OEMs, technical support contractors to the U.S. Customs Service and the Arizona National Guard.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Statement Of Objectives is to secure a prime contractor/business partner to be responsible for implementing the U.S. Customs Service National Enforcement Equipment Maintenance and Repair Program and Field Operations Support. 

This approach acquires, measures, accepts and pays for contract performance outcomes and results. As such, it leaves to the contractor to employ whatever prudent management and operations methods are necessary to deliver the results required by the U.S. Customs Service.  

Implementation of the contract must be scalable. The number of devices, the number of students, and the locations will be increasing for the foreseeable future.

The business partner shall be responsible for:

* full program management and controls of the logistics necessary to assure that the user will be presented with a device that will not only meet performance requirements, but which will be expeditiously and economically supported throughout its programmed life-cycle. 

*ensuring the proper planning and integration of all elements of logistics support and logistics support resource funds and management information.

* ensuring an orderly phase-in at the outset of the contract without compromising instant and scheduled maintenance and training actions.

* Ensuring an orderly phase-out in the event of re-competition or termination. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all data developed during the course of the contract, with the exception of proprietary financial data, can be readily transferred to and utilized by the Government or follow-on contractor at no cost.

We are seeking to contract with a business partner who is a SERVICE PROVIDER. This business partner should be an expert logistics program implementer and integrator with focus on customer satisfaction.

Specifically, the business partner shall be responsible for:

1. Maintaining the HTEE at a minimum Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%.  

1.1 Service records and logbooks.

1.2 Fluid storage and waste disposal.  

1.3 Corrosion control.

2. Training Customs Officers to operate the HTEE. The content of training shall always be up-to-date with respect to the physical configuration of the HTEE and operating recommendations of the HTEE manufacturer. 

3. Implementing post-production support to sustain out-of-production HTEE, maintain configuration control of all equipment changes and project replacement  of high maintenance cost HTEE equipment exhibiting wear-out symptoms.

3.1 Implementing HTEE changes and modifications and exercising change control. 

4. Staffing and operating a 7 X 24 central "Service Desk" at a contractor provided Operations Center. Providing total asset visibility of the operational status of all crew served HTEE equipment in USCS inventory in near real time. The Service Desk shall be collocated with the NEEMR Program Office.

5. Relocating HTEE from one Customs location to another. 

6. Reporting figures of merit so that the government may assess performance of HTEE, the program and of the contractor.

7. Procuring and Installing government specified video security systems at Customs facilities.

8. Program management.

8.1 Implementing an integrated logistics support program to ensure that maintenance planning, support tools and test equipment, parts, supplies, consumables, material handling, data processing, and packaging, handling, storage, and transportation support elements are available and utilized to yield safe, reliable and mission capable HTEE.

8.2. Establishing a program management office within 5 miles of the NEEMR facility including the facility for contractor personnel and not more than 8 specified U.S. Customs Service personnel to include but not be limited to managers, Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and project monitors.

8.3. Providing sufficient and appropriately skilled and located managers, service center operators, trainers, maintainers and engineering personnel to successfully fulfill the objectives of this Statement Of Objectives.

8.3.1 Applicable and required licenses, Secret level security clearances for all business partner personnel, and certificates for business partner personnel. The Customs Service will conduct background investigations on all employees.

8.3.2 Uniforms and identifying names/logos/insignia for business partner personnel working in Customs land border crossings, airports and seaports.

8.4 Accomplishing the objectives herein at Customs Ports of Entry and other Customs stations and during the hours of operation of the Customs locations; performing the requirements herein during crisis periods declared by the National Command Authority. 

8.5 Compliance with applicable local, city, state and federal laws, rules and regulations and union/management agreements.

8.6 Financial cost accounting and logistics reporting.

9. Fuels and lubricants required by the HTEE. 

10. Physical security for the HTEE.

11. Adapt to a dynamic environment of increased HTEE equipment as well as increased training requirements. Dynamic means that the number of devices to be supported, the number of Customs Officers to be trained, the number of locations, and the reporting requirements will be increasing at unknown and non-linear rates. 

12. Adapt to provide HTEE operators as required.

Note: Procurement of HTEE devices is not within the scope of the Statement of Objectives.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information only, not a Request for Proposals.  The USDA, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is seeking qualified firms to provide media services by informing persons with limited English proficiency about eligibility for nutrition assistance (Food Stamps) through appropriate Campaign methods as stated below.  Firms are encouraged to respond by submitting their capabilities and addressing the individual tasks below in sufficient detail to demonstrate their qualifications to meet the government's requirements.  Information must be sent to Patricia Palmer, Chief, Contract Management Branch, via mail at 3101 Park Center Drive, Room 220, Alexandria, VA 22302, fax at 703-305-2071, or electronically at patsy.palmer@fns.usda.gov, no later than COB August 12, 2002.  Questions may be directed to Patricia at 703-305-2251. 

Background/Purpose:  The Farm Bill expands Food Stamp eligibility to some legal immigrants (estimated 500,000) that have not been eligible to participate in the program since welfare-reform.  The majority of the newly eligible participants are Spanish dominant in menial or service industries.  Studies have shown that Spanish language radio is an effective means to communicate with this group.  Furthermore, there is a known stigma associated with the Food Stamp Program (FSP) that may discourage participation.
 
FNS proposes an education and outreach information campaign that consist of: 
(1) Daily Spanish language radio short form programs- with new information or a human interest angle discussing the FSP and/or other FNS nutrition programs, presented each day - to air on a minimum of 75 full time Spanish language radio stations with guaranteed clearance 6AM-7PM in the top 10 U.S. Hispanic markets.  Eligible firms MUST be able to identify programs which focus on the FSP.  No more than 10% non FSP shows.  Non-FSP shows require advance approval by FNS.  Eligible firms MUST also be able to meet the Government's performance schedule to begin airing shows by September 16, 2002 and to run thru November 30, 2002.  FNS anticipates one program per day.  This task is mandatory and the company must be able to meet all of the requirements.

(2) A newspaper editorial on the same subject using a regularly syndicated newspaper column with circulation to at least 60 Spanish language community newspapers to exceed 2 million copies weekly.  Eligible firms must demonstrate they have existing agreements with or means of establishing a network of Spanish language community newpapers in order to produce editorials.

<SUBJECT>A--STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL AND GAS EXPERIMENT (SAGE)III CONTAMINATION MEASUREMENT PACKAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
<SOLNBR>SS-CMP
<RESPDATE>082002
<ARCHDATE>07312003

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III Contamination Measurement Package for the International Space Station Background In collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), Alenia Aerospazio, and Ball Aerospace, NASA LaRC intends to fly a scientific payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2006.  The payload, SAGE III/Hexapod, consists of SAGE III instrument components and Hexapod.  The SAGE III instrument includes the Sensor Assembly, the Instrument Control Electronics (ICE), the Data Storage Unit (DSU), the Interface Adapter Module (IAM), and the Contamination Measurement Package (CMP).  Hexapod consists of the Hexapod Mechanical Assembly (HMA) and the Hexapod Electronics Unit (HEU).  Hexapod will provide attitude control for the SAGE III Sensor Assembly while aboard the ISS.  The payload will be mechanically and electrically attached to an Express Pallet Adapter (ExPA).  A suite of six ExPAs comprise the full payload complement for an Express Pallet System (ExPS). SAGE III will play a key role in global atmospheric observations.  The scientific mission objectives are: 1) to map vertical profiles of stratospheric aerosols, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and water vapor with approximately 1 km vertical resolution and determine high altitude cloud coverage globally; 2) to study the seasonal and global variations in these clouds and in stratospheric constituents in order to understand their effect on the Earth radiation budget and climate; 3) to utilize these stratospheric constituents as atmospheric tracers to study circulation, sources and sinks of these species, and transient phenomena such as volcanic eruptions; and 4) to investigate atmospheric chemistry involving these species and to study the optical and physical properties of aerosols. The SAGE III instrument is a highly sensitive optical instrument built for the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) to monitor stratospheric aerosols and gaseous constituents.  The application of the SAGE III instrument in the unknown and ever changing contamination environment on the International Space Station introduces concerns for its useful life, especially in the ultraviolet range of its measurements.  A CMP will gather data on the rates of contaminative deposition at the SAGE III location.  This will allow mission operators to predict contamination rates, sources and events. This information will allow the operators to take the necessary precautions to protect the SAGE III instrument, by restricting its operation in the direction of unacceptable contamination and during periods of unacceptable contaminating activities. Purpose of Notification In order to address this concern, NASA LaRC is soliciting for potential sources to provide a CMP that will provide the data needed to develop histograms of the contaminative deposition rates at the SAGE III location from each quadrant.  The data from this hardware instrument will allow the correlation of the contamination level of Space Station environment with specific events and/or functions and provide a relative measurement rate of contamination associated with an event or function.  The Contractor shall provide all resources to deliver the systems and services that meet the following requirements.  In order to effectively integrate, test and operate the CMP, proper and adequate documentation and support in addition to ground support equipment will be required from the Contractor. Technical Requirements The CMP consists of contamination sensors, which will be used to measure the deposition of molecular and particulate contamination due to all sources.  The CMP shall measure the deposition of contamination arriving from sources located 360 degrees in azimuth and +/- 75 degrees in elevation about the SAGE III Scan Mirror.   The CMP shall locate the emitting contamination source within the azimuth and elevation fields of view to within 5.  The CMP shall have the capability to distinguish the relative strength of contamination deposition sources in azimuth and elevation relative to the ExPA coordinate system. It shall provide this measurement at a rate of once per 10 sec. per sensor.   The deposition measured will be processed on board by the CMP subsystem (including conversion of the frequency measurement to the approximate deposition thickness).  The CMP sensors will be held at a temperature that is representative of the Sage III Elevation Mirror and must be able to periodically volatilize collected contaminants by heating.  The CMP has one (1) discrete 0-5 V command input, one (1) 0-10 V Analog telemeter output, and one (1) 28 VDC power input available from the SAGE III Interface Adapter Module  There is also a unidirectional Ethernet connection available from the ExPA to transmit science data towards ExPS.  Continuous operation of the CMP sensors is expected to be necessary immediately after orbit insertion. The data from the CMP will be down linked to the ground.    Sensor designs must include built-in heaters to permit cleaning of the sensing surfaces on orbit.  Each sensor shall be calibrated after bake-off by sending a mid-range voltage for one minute to determine any voltage drift.  The CMP shall measure the deposition of contamination at a level of at least 4.42 x 10-9 g/cm2/Hz for a temperature range of +80C to -50C. The CMP shall operate within specification at ambient pressures from sea level to deep space.  The total weight of the CMP shall not exceed 5 pounds.  The power of the CMP shall not exceed 12 Watts average power (20 W peak).  The equipment of the CMP shall be capable of useful life of 10 years of ground test and in-orbit operation.  The mission life requirement is 5 years.  Evidence of Capability Since this proposed activity provides space-flight hardware, which in turn provides data products to the SAGE III Mission Operations Team, it is essential that the Contractor have experience designing, producing, environmentally testing, and delivering space-flight hardware and associated ground support equipment. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.
