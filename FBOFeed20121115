The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide the requested services. The place of performance is within 20 miles of bldg 33010 Training Road Fort Hood TX 76544. The period of performance for this effort is from 1 January 2013 and ends on 31 December 2013. The resultant contract is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price type contract. This acquisition is issued on an unrestricted basis under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721110 and the related small business size standard of $30 million. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. Solicitation Number W911S1-13-R-0002 is assigned for reference purposes. The entire solicitation will be made available on or about 16 November 2012 via the FedBizOpps Website located at https://www.fbo.gov. The required response date will be stated in the solicitation.

It is the responsibility of the offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates, or changes to the solicitation. Please be advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available; you must download solicitation documents from the FBO. All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code, and register in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ in order to transact business with the government. Failure to obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code and register in the SAM may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror. For further information, please contact Diana Harris, Contract Specialist at Diana.v.harris.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Life Technologies Corporation, 5791 Van Allen Way, Carlsbad, CA 92008, for continued maintenance of three 7500Dx Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instruments, serial numbers 275010708, 275010720, and 275011731, and one 3130 Genetic Analyzer serial number 17207025 (service on this unit will not begin until April 22, 2013). The LPRB Laboratory has several pieces of laboratory equipment from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Life Technologies (formerly Applied Biosystems). The FDA requires the AB 7500 Fast Dx instrument to be maintained by the OEM to retain FDA-testing capability to maintain CLIA compliance; instruments that will potentially analyze clinical samples must also have documented maintenance performed on them. <br /><br />The vendor will provide scheduled equipment maintenance (PMs and OQs) and provide instrument repair. All travel, parts, and labor are to be included in the agreement and all reagents required for all service calls are also provided. Vendor is to respond to all calls within 24 hours (during business days) of the BRRAT Lab initiating a service request. This laboratory will receive a guaranteed 2 business day/priority on-site response. Vendor engineers will be required to provide a 4-hr phone response when dispatched to a service request. The AB 3130 xL Genetic Analyzer requires one PM visit per year, the three AB 7500 Fast Dx units require one PM visit per year and two (2) OQPQPs per year to satisfy FDA requirements. Vendor will automatically schedule annual planned maintenance (PM) and Operational Qualification Performance Qualification (OQPQ) at the start of the contract, and will automatically schedule an OQPQP 6 months after the initial PM/OQPQ. A Field Service Report for each service or maintenance performed, for each instrument shall be provided after completion of the service call, within two weeks of the service call. A completed Planned Maintenance Protocol (PMP) and/or an Operation Qualification and Performance Qualification Protocol (OQPQP) shall be provided within two weeks of the completion of a service call. Calibration widgets shall accompany the PMP or the OQPQP. <br /><br />Spectral Dye Calibration will be performed during the planned maintenance visit. Calibration involves analysis of signal strength from standard pure dyes to adjust software for correct data output (for Real Time PCR Instruments only). This includes (1) Dyes - standard 12 dye calibration, (2) Certification documentation, and (3) Certificate of Calibration.<br /><br />Vendor will provide computer upgrades/replacements for the real-time PCR instruments as the end-user or engineer determines necessary. The vendor will be required to maintain the computers for all AB instruments. The laboratory will have direct access to senior level service personnel for first-level problem resolutions; service personnel will provide immediate response in resolving many operational and instrument set-up problems.<br /><br />All parts will be certified and guaranteed to optimize instruments performance and reliability. All parts are manufactured by AB or AB's direct vendors. The vendor will use only new or true factory remanufactured parts.<br /><br />The Contractor shall ensure compliance with all applicable security regulations, and all CDC security operations requirements, for facility access, and handling of materials. Contractor personnel must comply with CDC security requirements for entry and exit control for personnel and property at the Government facility. This service will begin upon date of award to last for one year, and a six-month option is also anticipated.<br /><br />CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may use e-mail to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement before the expiration date of the advertisement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 15.201(c)(7) AND FAR 52.215-3. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be considered as a commitment by the Government to issue a RFP, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p>Background<br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognize suppliers are crucial partners in helping meet the challenges of supporting disaster survivors in the 21st century. Capitalizing on industry expertise, the Agency continues to work to improve how we provide temporary housing assistance.<br />FEMA is authorized under Section 408 of the Stafford Act to provide assistance to individuals and households. As part of that assistance FEMA procures, stores, transports and installs, and maintains manufactured homes that are used as temporary housing units (THUs). In order for FEMA to be prepared to respond to disasters the Agency maintains readiness contracts to procure manufactured homes from commercial vendors. Historically, the Agency has allowed vendors and manufactures to provide a key and lock system of their choosing. This method has worked in the past; however, recently the Agency has experienced issues with the existing key and lock system. The major issues are:<br />1. The lack of consistency in key and lock systems does not allow FEMA field managers or THU maintenance staff to have a master key system that is consistent across all THUs.<br />2. Lack of consistency also complicates key control and lock changing when a THU is reused.<br />3. There are instances where keys have been used for unauthorized entry into THUs.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the extension of the Engineering and Science Contract (ESC), NNJ05HI05C, at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a period of three months.  The ESC began February 1, 2005 and is currently scheduled for completion on January 31, 2013.  NASA intends to extend the period of performance through April 30, 2013.  This extension to the ESC is required to provide continued engineering products and technical services for the JSC Engineering and Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Directorates while the follow-on procurement is competed and awarded.   The current ESC provides development and integration of a broad spectrum of engineering products and technical services related to human operations in space through a diversity of assigned engineering requirements.  The ESC provides engineering, analysis, and test products and services along with laboratory/testbed operations and maintenance to primarily the Engineering Directorate, as well as the ARES Directorate.  Scientific products and services are provided to the ARES Directorate including the development and operation of state-of-the-art laboratories, conducting research for planetary materials and processes, curation of NASAs astromaterial collections, and dissemination of data to scientific and academic communities.   Services and supplies provided under the ESC are essential toward continuity of missions and milestones on  the International Space Station Program, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle Program, James Webb Space Telescope Program, NASA Docking System Project, and other advanced exploration projects. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the services from Jacobs Technology, the current contractor. The procurement will be supported by a Justification For Other Than Full And Open Competition pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  Jacobs Technology has unique knowledge of all projects and programs that the Engineering and ARES Directorates supports and is able to provide continued services without unacceptable duplication of cost or delay in fulfilling the agencys requirements.	  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified POC no later than 4:30 p.m. local time December 6, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<SUBJECT>Patient Safety Monitoring In International Laboratories (SMILE)
<SOLNBR>RFP-NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2011-129
<RESPDATE>121511
<CONTACT>Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-7084, Fax 301-480-4675, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - John R. Manouelian, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0612, Fax 301-480-4675, Email manouelj@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols outside the U.S. NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of subjects who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories in the U.S. are required to meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) performance standards and participate in a variety of external proficiency testing programs. Though non-U.S. accreditation organizations and providers of proficiency testing programs exist, these vary significantly in their requirements and level of oversight of clinical laboratories.
<p>The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) contract is to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols by (1) monitoring laboratories compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP), (2) monitoring the ability of laboratories to reliably perform protocol-specified tests by evaluating results obtained with panels of coded samples, (3) providing Labs with various means of assistance, guidance and training to address and prevent recurrence of deficiencies in GCLP and/or proficiency testing, and (4) maintaining a computerized data management system and document library that include lab performance data and guidance documents. Currently, SMILE supports approximately 150 non-U.S. laboratories in 19 countries. SMILE will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids/networks/pages/daidsnetworks.aspx).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year beginning approximately November 15, 2012 through November 14, 2013. The requirement will be the delivery of 11.70 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and 11.70 FTE per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 10 Labs. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 0.65 FTE. Up to two (2) Options may be exercised in year 1, year 3, and/or year 5 for a total of 30 Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for additional Labs is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract. Therefore, when an Option to extend the term of the contract is exercised, Options to extend the support for the Labs will also be exercised.</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Electronic Data Management System and Document Library services: During the course of the contract, additional specialized expertise may be needed to enhance existing computer software systems in order to accommodate documents, similar to those managed by SMILE, received from other NIAID laboratory-supporting. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.25 FTEs with expertise in software development and support. One (1) Option may be exercised in any year of the contract for a total of seven (7) Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for the additional specialized expertise is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract. Therefore, when an Option to extend the terms of the contract is exercised, Options to extend support for the additional specialized expertise will also be exercised.</p>
<p>Increased Expertise for Proficiency Testing Oversight Services: During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to acquire Proficiency Testing (PT) Oversight Services when commercial products are not available to monitor Lab proficiency in performing novel Protocol-specified tests (e.g., quantitative TB cultures). If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 2.55 FTEs. One (1) Option may be activated for the acquisition of proficiency testing services in any year of the contract for a total of seven (7) Options during the life of the contract. Once an Option for new PT oversight services is exercised, it is the Government's intent to continue the support for the life of the contract.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 15, 2011, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Applied Technologies, Inc. (BAE), 1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850 that will provide for support to the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (Code 4.5.10) of NAWCAD in the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of shipboard C4I electronic communication systems; the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of like systems at shore sites associated with the deployment of fleet support to surface ships; and the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of mobile and airborne C4I electronic communication systems designed to interface with the C4I electronic architecture of surface ships. This acquisition will result in a ceiling increase to the current contract N00421-11-C-1058. The proposed increase in ceiling is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under exisiting BAE contract N00421-11-C-1058 while the follow-on action, estimated award April 2013, is being competed. Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-11-C-1058 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 27 June 2012, 1530 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Kym Parker, Code 2.5.1.2.4.5, Telephone (301) 737-7560, FAX (301) 995-0430 or via email: kimberly.l.parker@navy.mil.
<p><br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services without causing a break in work. BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competitition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The objective of this contract is to provide Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements throughout the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS). Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The A-E contracts are intended to provide a variety of A-E services to include but not limited to: planning, survey, energy conservation and analyses studies, and other investigations/studies; comprehensive interior designs; development of Request For Proposal (RFP); and design services related to new construction, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of various medical facilities, including related infrastructure systems, medical equipment planning and components worldwide. The design of complex healthcare related facilities and laboratories is an integral part of this requirement. The CEHNC Design Manual (CEHNC 1110-1-1) and Unified Facilities Criteria for Medical Military Facilities (UFC 4-510-01) detail the specific design standards and processes associated with this acquisition for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria. In addition, the UFC Antiterrorism Force Protection Standards must be followed. The A-E firms must be able to provide design considerations for facilities related to healthcare planning. Work may include preparation of design tools, design criteria documents, studies, cost estimates (parametric and quantity take off), interim life safety plans, commissioning plans, facility demolition plans that include hazardous waste identification and removal procedures, concept designs, final designs, construction phase services, and technical review of designs prepared by others. Contractors must have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services. In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract.

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Contractor may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E contractor will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself.
<p>In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award Unrestricted, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) with a portion of the awards reserved for small business concerns. The intent is to award contracts to six responsible firms, three large and three small businesses (SB). However, the Government reserves the right to award more, less or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The awards will be for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders (TOs) will be negotiated. The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MFAES requirement is anticipated to equal approximately $249,000,000 over a potential duration of five (5) years.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, with the SB size standard of $14M in annual receipts. The solicitation will include detailed ordering procedures specifying the circumstances for reserving a TO for SB. The Government will reserve awards for the A-E TOs consisting of peer reviews, RFP development, independent technical reviews, and designs that are not high complex including, but not limited to, small hospitals, medical and dental clinics, and laboratories to the SB awardee(s) prior to consideration of all the unrestricted awardees unless justified in writing as to why the SB firms should not be considered first. However, if the TO is not reserved for SB firms they will still be considered for award with the entire unrestricted suite. In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the work is required by employees of the prime contractor on a contract reserved for small business.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction design-build contracts or any TO that relate to any A-E TO awarded under this contract.

<DESC>Description: The Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems (PM-MAS), <P>Picatinny Arsenal, NJ and the Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ) are <P>currently seeking sources to develop an alternate tracer technology to replace <P>the current 7.62mm M62A1 and the 5.56mm M856A1 trace capability. The <P>technology to be developed shall provide day/night trace capability, in lieu <P>of traditional small caliber ammunition pyrotechnic tracer cartridges, and <P>shall only be visible from the shooters perspective, concealing his or her <P>position from enemy forces. It is the Governments desire to have the concepts <P>be implemented into the 7.62mm M80A1 and 5.56mm M855A1 ball cartridges but <P>shall consider all concepts that replace current pyrotechnic trace cartridges. <P>It is also desired to have minimum system level impacts to the currently <P>fielded systems, i.e. night vision goggles, Thermal weapon sights, optics, and <P>weapon systems.   The Government intends to use existing weapons systems.  As <P>such, no weapons modifications are envisioned to be made for use with the <P>alternate tracer. The contractor shall advance materials development to a <P>Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (prototype demonstration in a relevant <P>environment).  It is envisioned that technologies that meet Government program <P>requirements would advance into and through a follow-on Engineering & <P>Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort for qualification via Test & Evaluation <P>(TRL 8, actual system completed and "flight qualified" through test and <P>demonstration).  Effort will include developmental enhancement and/or <P>optimization of different materials/technologies, prototype and manufacturing <P>process development, support validation of cost estimates and major testing to <P>provide adequate data to validate designs.  Effort will also include the <P>development of product drawings. <P> <P> <P>Specifications:  A specification has not yet been developed for alternate <P>tracer.  Performance requirements are expected to be equal to or better than <P>current tracer specification requirements <P> <P> <P>Planned Acquisition:  The proposed requirement will include an initial award <P>of up to four sources.  It is contemplated that the acquisition may include <P>down selection criteria at intervals until TRL 6 is achieved. <P> <P> <P>Submission Information:  All responsible interested sources should submit <P>their research and development experience, capabilities, and qualification <P>data.    Submittal of information is requested via electronic mail only, no <P>later than 30 days from the date of this notice.  All responses should be <P>submitted to Trisha Fitton at ACC-NJ, e-mail address <P>trisha.a.fitton.civ@mail.mil.  Please include company name, address, telephone <P>number, email address, technical point of contact,  and company size (please <P>specify as either a Large Business, Foreign-Owned Business, Small Business, <P>Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Woman-Owned Small Business, <P>Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small <P>Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business).  Offerors are also requested to <P>provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) and the length of time to complete a) <P>TRL 3-4, b)TRL 5, c)TRL 6, and d)EMD.

<DESC>1. Description. This announcement is to conduct market research on industry's ability to manufacture, integrate, model, test and deliver additional agile PTSS satellites beyond those being developed by the current laboratory development team. This announcement also seeks industry's feedback on the acquisition strategy for a future request for proposal (RFP) to build these additional satellites.
<p>The intended outcomes of this market research are to determine industry and small business capabilities and the extent to which commercial items or non-developmental items could be used to build the PTSS industry satellites, and to use responses to develop acquisition strategy alternatives.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this request for information (RFI). Any response will be treated as information only and not a proposal. Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on, proposals submitted to any future formal RFP. Eligibility to participate in a future acquisition does not depend upon your response to this notice. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) will not evaluate the responses to this notice. The MDA does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not reimburse any costs associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>The MDA does not seek or want proprietary information. If you submit such information, you must clearly mark "proprietary" on every sheet containing such information and segregate the proprietary information to the maximum extent practical from other portions of your response (for example, use an attachment or exhibit). Respondents are responsible for adequately marking proprietary information in their response.</p>
<p>The Government intends to use non-Government (contractor) support personnel as subject matter experts to help the program office review the responses, including review of any marked or unmarked proprietary information. The non-Government (contractor) support personnel have executed non-disclosure agreements with the Government. Those agreements are on file with the Government. If you respond to this RFI, it would constitute your acknowledgement and agreement that the information you provided, including any marked or unmarked proprietary information, may be disclosed to these non-Government (contractor) support personnel.</p>
<p>2. Background. The MDA is chartered to develop a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space assets to defend the United States, its friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, the MDA began the PTSS program as a new space sensor for the BMDS. The objective of the program is to deliver an operational space-based missile tracking system to address the post-boost challenge; to provide engagement quality, fire-control quality tracks to networked shooters; to support object characterization and discrimination; and to be an agile, effective sensor against mobile and emerging threats.</p>
<p>To meet this objective, MDA will acquire the PTSS in two phases: a laboratory development phase and an industry manufacturing and production phase. The two distinct phases will progress concurrently, with planned award of the industry manufacturing phase's contract occurring before the PTSS critical design review. For the laboratory development phase, the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), leads a laboratory team to design, integrate and launch two satellites in FY 2017. The other laboratory members on this UARC, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and military service team include Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Utah State University Space Dynamics Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories. The Government will receive a technical data package for the development program with technical data, algorithms, and software with Government purpose rights. Additionally, the Government will ensure all PTSS data remains Government purpose rights and/or unlimited rights for the duration of the entire PTSS program.</p>
<p>The Government intends to buy more satellites in the manufacturing and production phase in two steps. In Step 1, before laboratory critical design review, the Government plans to competitively award two industry manufacturing and production contracts for industry to work with the laboratory development team using Government acquired data rights and the laboratory developed technical data package. In Step 2, after laboratory critical design review, the Government will conduct a limited competition between the two Step 1 industry teams to manufacture, test, and deliver their satellites. The industry satellite competition is planned so that the Government will favor proposals minimizing changes to the laboratory developed system design, limiting changes to those that improve manufacturing, producibility and affordability. We anticipate that during constellation fielding and satellite replenishment follow-on, satellite procurements will be lot buys acquired as either priced options to the industry manufacturing and production satellite contract and/or as separate competitive procurements. The laboratory development phase will set the performance baseline for the industry manufacturing and production phase. While the size of the operational constellation has not been established by the warfighter, this RFI seeks interested industry participants able to build approximately ten initial satellites.</p>
<p>3. PTSS Laboratory Satellite Overview. PTSS satellites are agile vehicles supporting two payloads: a sensor payload and a communications payload. The sensor payload is body-fixed with focal plane arrays in three colors: two infrared colors and a single visible/near infrared color. The communications payload will have crosslinking capability with each of its neighbor satellites in the on-orbit constellation and an uplink/downlinking capability with dedicated PTSS ground station(s). PTSS satellites will operate in low Earth orbit and observe ballistic missile trajectories above the Earth's limb.</p>
<p>4. Submission Instructions. The MDA requests interested parties submit responses that cover the following items:</p>
<p>1. What are your capabilities or products to perform the scope identified in this RFI?</p>
<p>2. Can commercial and/or non-developmental items satisfy the need in this RFI?</p>
<p>3. What are your customary practices for warranties, discounts and contract type?</p>
<p>4. What are the distribution and support capabilities of potential suppliers?</p>
<p>5. What legal or regulatory requirements are unique to this acquisition?</p>
<p>6. What functions, typically found in the ground segment to control and operate the industry satellites, could be advantageously partitioned to be in the space segment? (Note: for this question, the space segment is defined to be the constellation of satellites and the ground segment is the terrestrial antenna station(s), mission and constellation software and data networking equipment.)</p>
<p>7. What type and level of software capability/certifications should be required to assure that industry software development processes fully support and are synchronized with satellite system hardware development and manufacturing activities? (For example, capability maturity model integration (CMMI) levels.)<br /><br />8. Recommend anticipated percentages for small business subcontractor participation for industry satellites. Include the proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and the type of small business contractor you expect to use.<br /><br />9. Indicate whether you would join in the industry satellite acquisition with other firms/entities as team member or joint venture. Include your company size and status.</p>
<p>10. Recommend incentives/ratios and pricing arrangements for the industry satellite acquisition. Include incentives that minimize changes to the satellite design, lower production cost, and so forth. Include supporting rationale with your recommendations.<br /><br />11. In terms of submitting a proposal for a best value source selection, what content do you recommend the Government should request for critical evaluation for the industry satellites based on a technical data package containing proceeds from the laboratory preliminary design review? Include supporting rationale with your recommendations.</p>
<p>12. In terms of evaluating a company that submits a proposal, what evaluation criteria differentiates companies' capabilities (for example, data rights, software engineering, and manufacturing processes) if a best value source selection is conducted for the industry satellites based on a technical data package containing proceeds from the laboratory preliminary design review? Include supporting rationale with your recommendations.</p>
<p>13. What data items do you recommend be included in the technical data package provided at the time of the industry satellite RFP (assumed to be between the preliminary and critical design reviews of the laboratory program)? Assign a priority to each item based on the following scale: high = essential / required information; medium = valuable supporting information; low = non-essential useful information.</p>
<p>14. What is your experience with concurrency? Do you see problems in working with a non-organic design? How would you mitigate risk when working with the laboratory team in a concurrent environment?</p>
<p>15. Recommend how to minimize nonrecurring engineering costs in the transition from the laboratory development to the industry production phase.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to a maximum of 15 pages, excluding the cover page. The cover page must show: 1) company name and address; 2) primary point of contact and one alternate; 3) telephone number and e-mail address; 4) Dun &amp; Bradstreet, or "D-U-N-S," number; 5) Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) code; 6) NAICS code; 7) small business category and size standard, if applicable; and 8) facility clearance, and to what level.</p>
<p>To assist with these RFI questions, this announcement includes a "PTSS Information Library" package. The library contains PTSS background and program information. Interested companies must register at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and be added to the authorized parties list under this announcement to receive access to the library. If added on the authorized parties list, the company will receive email notification that access has been granted to the package. Contractors are not authorized to further disseminate documents marked "For Official Use Only" in this library.</p>
<p>Submit your response in electronic format to Valarie Hall, PTSS contracting officer, at ptss@mda.mil, no later than 30 calendar days after the original posting of this request. Submit questions that help interested sources clarify information in this RFI in electronic format and send them to the email address above. All questions must be received no later than 15 calendar days after the original posting of this request. The Government will try to answer as many questions as possible, but may defer some to Industry Day. In all cases, the Government will provide answers publicly. The MDA will not acknowledge receipt of responses to this RFI. The MDA will not accept classified information.</p>
<p>5. Industry Day. The MDA may conduct an Industry Day and possibly have one-on-one discussions after reviewing responses to this RFI. If you respond, we encourage you (including small and small disadvantaged businesses) to attend and discuss this RFI with us. Details of the Industry Day will be in a forthcoming announcement on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).</p>

<a href="mailto:Logan.Kevin@epa.gov">Logan.Kevin@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380, Testing Laboratories.  The U.S. EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) conducted a passive sampling study as part of the Near-road EXposures to Urban air pollutants Study (NEXUS) conducted in the fall 2010 and winter 2011.  This study generated an estimated 185 passive samples requiring analysis by Computer-Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy (CCSEM).  CCSEM can determine PM10-2.5 mass as well as individual particle size, morphology, and chemistry.  Although many of these samples will be analyzed by the EPA using the CCSEM facilities of the EPA's Scanning Electron Microscopy Lab, there is a need for additional analytical support to meet the objectives of these field studies in a timely fashion.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source firm fixed-price purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with R.J. Lee Group for Computer-Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy (CCSEM) analysis of these 185 UNC passive aerosol samples.  The Government believes R.J. Lee Group is the only company capable of providing these services because the UNC passive sampler was developed in conjunction with a semi-empirical model (Leith-Wagner Deposition Velocity model).  No other model has been evaluated in the literature and been shown through field studies to provide quantitative results for the UNC passive sampler.  
The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1 Sole Source, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from date of award. 
All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement.  This solicitation and amendments will be available via the internet at the following URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/index.htm
The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this acquisition to R.J. Lee group and to also determine if any other source(s) exist.  Therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submit your response to the U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park [RTP] Procurement Operations Division Attn: Louis Williams via email at williams.louis@epa.gov.
Contracting Office Address: Environmental Protection Agency, ORD Service Center, NERL, RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

The U.S. EPA?s IED Division in ORIA is responsible for a broad r ange of voluntary activities designed to support the development and implementation of national policies on indoor air quality.  The primary objective of the Indoor Environments Program is to protect the public health by promoting healthier indoor environments.  A. The contractor shall provide support for the development of new, science-based indoor air quality policies and program strategies, and evaluation of existing program implementation strategies.  The contractor shall provide analytic services, including cost-benefit and/or other economic analyses, market penetration assessments, etc., to evaluate the effectiveness of current Agency policies on indoor environmental quality and provide recommendations for improvements; B.  The contractor shall provide support to analyze, disseminate, support, and/or develop information and materials on indoor air quality related issues; C. The contractor shall provide support for developing effective methods to communicate with the ge neral public and with specified target audiences,  domestically and internationally, such as:  school decision makers, parents, school-based personnel; health care providers, asthma patients and their care givers; parents and public health advocates concerned about children?s exposure to secondhand smoke; homeowners, home buyers and sellers, renters, code officials, and the real estate and building industries regarding the health impacts of radon exposure and other indoor air pollutants; building owners and facility and energy managers concerning proper design, construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings for healthy indoor air quality and reduced vulnerability to intentional releases of biological or chemical contaminants; health care industry regarding incorporation of environmental controls into standards of care; and other audiences with whom the Program may choose to communicate messages concerning risks and risk reduction in the indoor environment; D.  Public  demand for knowledge about indoor environmental problems, including their health risks and the means by which human exposure can be reduced, has been fueled by a growing body of scientific information confirming the adverse impacts of poor indoor air quality on health, comfort, and productivity.  The program recognizes the need for a variety of audiences to understand these risks and to be informed about available methods for risk reduction.  As a voluntary program, two of the main objectives of the program are to: (1) develop and disseminate information, including technical and non-technical guidance;  and (2) conduct education and outreach activities that will inform a broad range of potential users, including the general public; building design, construction, and facility and energy management professionals; private sector diagnostic and mitigation firms; industry associations; environmental researchers and experts; indoor environments educators; EPA program partners; pub lic health and advocacy organizations; health practitioners; environmental health officials at Federal, state, and local levels; and related groups; E.  The Program works with Agencies and organizations at the Federal, state and local level, with other nations, and with a range of domestic and international stakeholder and target audience groups, to promote more effective approaches to identifying and solving indoor environmental problems as well as applying community leadership and social marketing techniques to accelerate environmental risk reduction results.  To provide effective communication, the Program may initiate meetings, training, conferences, events, or workshops, or work collaboratively with others to do so; and F.  Among the key responsibilities of the Indoor Environments Divisions are the development and dissemination of publications and other outreach materials and the live presentation of both substantive and organizational information to a variety of audien ces.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of potential firms for a highly specialized environmental monitoring well project.  NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought.  NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, DO NOT request a copy of a solicitation.  Potential offerors having the skill, capabilities and personnel necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback via e-mail to Ms. Niki Haas at Noelani.N.Haas@usace.army.mil; Phone: 916/557-7027.  All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.   This project is in early planning stages and may be solicited in 2013 if funds are available.  The NAICS Code is 541620, the size standard is $14 million (average annual receipts for preceding three fiscal years), and the Product Service Code (PSC) is R425, Professional Services/Engineering Technical.  The duration of the project is 6 months.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Program and Project Management, and Execution of Assessment Tasks, Analytical Testing of Groundwater for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9 and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP).  Work for U. S. EPA Pacific Southwest Region 9 covers Southern California in the San Gabriel and San Fernando water basins.  The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, material, tools, supervision, quality control, and other items necessary to ensure project completion.  The work is to provide results of analytical testing of groundwater.  This includes the installation of a monitoring well in each of an estimated 16 sites.  Each site is located in an urban residential neighborhood, and care must be taken to minimize noise levels, congestion, and disturbances, to residents.  Wells shall be installed within one 12 foot lane (while the other two traffic lanes remain open) within the city of Los Angeles.  Wells shall be drilled up to a depth of 1000 feet (typically with boulders) with minimal residential disruption and within a severely tight timeline.  Wells shall be a combination of one-zone, two-zone, and three-zone installations.  LADWP (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power) requires specifically Simulprobe groundwater sampling and ZIST pump installation by BESST (no substitutions allowed).  Well development will be challenging as well casings will be four inches and piezometers will be one inch, both installed up to 1,000 feet deep.  Due to the drilling depth, preferred drilling equipment should be owned (dependable, sharp drills, well maintained), and not rented.  Both air rotary and mud rotary rigs will be required.  Air rotary has proven to be effective to first water and mud rotary after that to get the right samples and to ensure good data and well development.  Also the lay down area is a maximum of only 150 feet by 12 feet.  Work must be constrained within that space.  Samples shall be collected from each zone and several batteries of analytical tests shall be performed on the samples, requiring Electronic Data Report format reporting.  Several wells shall be installed and tested concurrently.  With a possible projected award date of 1 March 2013 or later, sampling must be complete for all 16 wells no later than 30 June 2013 (hard deadline).  Traffic control services will also be required.  Wells shall remain in place for further monitoring and testing.    CAPABILITY STATEMENT  The following information is designed to apprise the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective contractor's project execution capability.  Please provide your response to the following.  The submission is limited to 4 pages.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes and is published only to encourage interested parties to gather information about commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed below.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A RFI. NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>1. SUBJECT: The United States Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) is conducting market research on technology solutions for Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) suitable for field use in a battlefield setting. Responses are due to this Request for Information (RFI) by 31 Jan 2013, 4:00 PM EDT.</p>
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Information and representative samples as responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, USAMMA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: Wounds sustained on the battlefield can be especially problematic, given the nature and severity of the injuries and the environment in which they are sustained. In the deployed environment, one modality that is being considered to improve wound healing is Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). With NPWT, subatmospheric pressure is applied to a wound via a suction unit, dressing, evacuation tube, and outer dressing. The system is connected to a collection container that collects excess fluid from the wound bed, thereby enhancing circulation and disposal of cellular waste from the lymphatic system. Clinical benefits associated with the treatment reportedly include increasing local blood flow, decreasing bacterial colonization, facilitating the ability to measure and assess wound fluid, and increasing the rate of granulation tissue creation, contraction, and epithelialization. In addition, the wound is uniformly drawn closed by applying controlled, localized negative pressure. The USAMMA has identified a need for a NPWT for use by troops in deployed environments. Accordingly, the NPWT device will be used in non-standard medical environments with variable weather and lighting conditions.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: There are two types of wound vacs that are required: one (1) for the intensive care unit (ICU) and one (1) for transport (the latter would be designated as a patient movement item (PMI) equipment). It is conceivable that one model could meet the requirements of both locations. The NPWT solution will provide a cost-effective, portable method for treating wounds. The tool must be lightweight, durable, and operable on the battlefield. The NPWT solution must be able to be used in-flight and in austere environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Responses should address the requirements identified in item 4A of this RFI. Responses should include a representative sample of the device for limited examination. Sample items submitted will not be returned.</p>

<SUBJECT>TRAINING RESOURCE MODEL/INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING RESOURCE MODEL (TRM/ITRM) SUPPORT
<SOLNBR>H92239-13-T-TRMI
<RESPDATE>120512
<CONTACT>Valaida J Bradford, Phone 910 3960560, Fax 910 4329345, Email bradforv@soc.mil
<DESC>The United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) is seeking to identify all responsible sources capable of providing Training Resource Model and Institutional Training Resource Model (TRM/ITRM) support for the USASOC Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3 Plans Division at Fort Bragg, NC. These services include populating and adapting the TRM/ITRM data fields with USASOC unique data so that these models will serve as the single framework for resource discussions. Providing authoritative, analytical, readiness-base, trainer-driven methodology for determining the operating tempo (OPTEMPO) and cost in dollars required to support training and peacetime readiness objectives; Computing the cost of alternative training strategies; Articulating the level of training readiness supported by a specified budget by providing a readiness based benchmark for defining requirements; Providing uniform methodology for defining training resource requirements from HQDA to unit level that is based upon an approved force structure; Enhancing internal USASOC resource management practices and those of it Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) and Major Subordinate Units (MSUs).<br />&nbsp;<br />
<p>Background: Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA), Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3 sponsored the development of two resource models designed to capture total training costs expended per program per individual. These models came to be known as the Training Resource Model (TRM) and the Institutional Training Resource Model (ITRM). These models provide estimates for Army -wide funding requirements to support Modified Table of Organization &amp; Equipment (MTOE) unit training and operations (resources commonly referred to as OPTEMPO) as well as a data set that estimates funding requirements for individual soldier training. Together, these models support resource decision making in the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) at HQDA.</p>
<p>The TRM captures costs for collective and joint training, operations, joint operations, combat development, force management and force structuring. It aids in determining resources required to execute missions and prioritize the distribution of these resources.</p>
<p>The ITRM produces estimates of both student and schoolhouse costs associated with individual training. It offers great flexibility by providing the end user with the aggregate echelon level of detail, but also the course level of detail (e.g. type of training, course title, phase, student component, school code of the institution, cost category, appropriation , AMS Code, etc.) Additionally it generates data displays and reports for time-sensitive and dynamic analyses by functional analysts within the Plans Division. These models have been accepted at the HQDA, OSD and Congressional levels as the definitive platforms to determine resource requirements for MTOE unit and schoolhouse training and operations.</p>
<p>Due to the nature and sensitivity of this support, the contractor shall possess or obtain a facility clearance at the classification level of SECRET/collateral or better. The contractor personnel to provide support under this contract shall as well possess a current and valid (at performance start date) SECRET/collateral security clearance. The contractor shall be required to submit all applicable company information necessary to adjudicate a facility security clearance utilizing a Government-furnished Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specifications, (DD Form 254). The Government intends to award a firm fixed contract for a twelve month base period and four additional twelve month option periods.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all direct labor, material, supervision of contract personnel and other items and services necessary to provide TRM/ITRM support to USASOC DCS, G-3. This support requires coordination, information and data sharing. The primary location for execution of this contract is Fort Bragg, NC. <br /><br />The Subject Matter Expert (SME) required for this contract shall provide technical resources and services on behalf of USASOC and other entities as required. This SME support encompasses those actions necessary to ensure that TRM/ITRM applications meet the needs of USASOC and its MSCs and MSUs. Functional and technical design actions needed to support this effort include, but are not limited to the following: Functional System Design, Technical System Design, System Integration, Software Development, Unit Testing, Standards of Quality Assurance (SQA), Data Analysis (System Inputs), Database Maintenance, Software Maintenance, User Training, End User Documentation , and Functional Analysis.</p>
<p>The contractor personnel may be required to travel in support of this requirement. Travel outside the Continental United States is not anticipated.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirement. The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted in response to the RFI. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for any information submitted by respondents to this request. Interested parties are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than four pages that demonstrates the respondent's ability to meet the requirements as specified herein.

<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain, the CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division based out of Lynn, MA, USA. The model 14RF-37 Propeller assemblies are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand based out of Windsor locks CT, USA. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft and its CT7-9C3 turboprop engines, are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br />USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To establish a Five year, firm-fixed price contract to purchase aircraft parts (see listing).Only the exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. This requirement must be restricted to authorized sources of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide the components and obtain the proprietary data required meeting form, fit, and function of the units. The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.These requirements are necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions.<br /><br />REPLIES:</p>

Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 336413- Aircraft assemblies, subassemblies, and parts (except engines) manufacturing. Please respond to the following questions (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?

<DESC><p><br />TO PROCURE one Autologous Cultured Chondrocytes, the Carticel replant. NAICS Code 33913, Size Standard 500 Employees. This is a Sole Source procurement, synopsis published for informational purposes only. Solicitation documents are not available. This proposed contract action is for procurement of an item for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1. <br />The proposed source is USBioservices, 3101 Gaylord Parkeway;Frisco, TX 75034. The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations received within two (2) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />The Government has a requirement for a Carticel Implantation or Chondroplasty. The orthopedic surgeon performing the surgery is only trained in the use of Carticel, and there would be unacceptable delays in retraining the surgeon on a different system. The estimated timeline to retrain the surgeon is 1 year, as result of such training an estimated 1 patient per month would be sent to another hospital for such surgery at $69,532.80 per patient. Therefore, a total of $834,393.36 would be incurred by the Government to send the patients off base due to the training for the surgeon. The only known vendor that can satisfy the Government's requirements is US Bioservices. US Bioservices is the sole distributor for the elbow fixture instruments for all VA and DOD hospitals.</p>

<SOLNBR>EXPRESS-2013_Open_Season_Add_Primes
<CONTACT>Marcia N. Tully, Contracting Officer, Phone 2568427409, Email marcia.tully@us.army.mil
<DESC>EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel). These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support. The complete scopes of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below. The EXPRESS program consists of four (4) domains in which services may be ordered: Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical (B&amp;A). Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the domains as follows: Business &amp; Analytical - 4 each, Logistics - 6 each, Programmatic - 6 each, and Technical - 11 each. The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the Government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams. The purpose of the current open season is to add additional BPA teams. Domain Statements of Work as well as other EXPRESS information may be found on the EXPRESS website located at: <br /><br />http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa/Express.asp
<p>The Government intends to award additional BPAs in the following domains as noted: B&amp;A - two small business (SB); Logistics - one full and open (F&amp;O) and two SB; Programmatic - one F&amp;O, 2 SB and one 8A reserve; and Technical - one F&amp;O, one SB reserve and one 8A reserve. These are estimated numbers only. The Government reserves the right to vary the number of awards depending on the number of responsive quotations submitted. The F&amp;O awards will be determined first, followed by the SB reserved awards, and finally the 8(a) reserved awards. Eligibility to compete for the anticipated BPA awards is limited to those businesses which hold one of the required GSA schedules and, for the SB/8A reserves, which meet the size standards for the NAICS Code applicable to that schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program. Respondents may seek consideration as a prime/team leader in more than one domain.</p>
<p>Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules at the time it responds to the Request for Quotation (RFQ): 871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Information Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers. Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to the RFQ. However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the majority of the domain requirements must be identified. Companies interested in obtaining a GSA schedule, or expediting a schedule application that has been submitted may contact the local representative, Eddie Mills via email at eddie.mills@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents' schedule by GSA will apply. If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541330 and a size standard of $27M, will apply to the Business &amp; Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS Code 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain. If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $25M will apply to all domains. If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified. The NAICS Code and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply. The applicable NAICS Code must be available on the schedule identified as primary. The small business certification which was made at the primary schedule contract level, for that applicable NAICS Code, will be utilized to determine business size for EXPRESS.</p>
<p>Respondents are cautioned that failure to comply with the following criteria will result in the rejection of their submission, and they will not be considered for award: (1) Must hold one of the required GSA schedules, as of the date of submission of quote, (2) Submission of all required documentation as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>The RFQs will be posted on the EXPRESS website sometime in January. Responses to the RFQs will be due approximately 30 days after the RFQ issue date to the following address: U.S. Army Contracting Command, ATTN: CCAM-EX-P/Elbert Clarke, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address. Late submissions will not be considered.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an Industry Day, regarding the addition of primes, and EXPRESS-The Next Generation, will be held sometime in January. Specifics regarding this Industry Day will be published as soon as they are finalized.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFQ shall be submitted electronically to RFQ Questions and Answers on the EXPRESS website.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from Army Contracting Command-Redstone (Colorado Springs), 350 Vandenberg St, Peterson AFB CO 80914. This Request for Information is issued for information, planning, and market research purposes only. It does not constitute a request for quotes or a promise to issue a request for quotes in the future.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information from any business concerns that are qualified for a Top Secret (TS)/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) facility to house the Army Space Cadre Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado between August 5-8, 2013.</p>
<p>The Army Space Cadre Symposium provides continuing education and professional development in support of Army Space Cadre members (military and civilian) worldwide. It brings the Army Space community (including<br />FA40s, enlisted Soldiers, Department of Defense Civilians as well as Government Contractors on a space available basis) together in a forum helping to keep them up-to-date on key space related issues facing the Army and Nation, and creates an environment for mentoring and leader development opportunities for Space Cadre members.</p>
<p>Here are the RFI requirements for our facility:<br />Colorado Springs local area<br />Government access to facility 0700 - 1700 daily, 5-8 August 2013<br />Seat up to 200 people; minimum of 28 at tables<br />Classification level up to TS/SCI<br />Sound and projection system</p>
<p>The tables will be reserved for senior leaders and should face the front of the room. Our people can "flip slides" but we will need the contractor to load the briefings on their server. We will have the participants send their Visit Access Request (VARs) with the appropriate Security Management Office (SMO) code to the contractor for verification. We would like it to be "no escort required" for all personnel except for foreign nationals, if any register.</p>
<p>The Government requests interested parties provide information about their company to include the Security Officer name and phone number, Cage Code, and Size Standard.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) intends to extend Contract No. NND06AB40B with MECx, LP (MECx) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of the NASA/DFRC Code SH, Safety, Health, and Environmental Office. The objective is to extend the performance period for five (5) months plus seven (7) one-month options.  This extension will ensure program continuity and critical mission support while allowing the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated with a competitive follow-on procurement.  The current Contractor provides mission critical safety, health, and environmental support services for the NASA/DFRC Edwards and Palmdale locations.  Services are currently obtained using a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Contractor provides all resources, including labor, supervision, materials and management necessary to operate safety, health and environmental support service functions as described in the Statement of Work.  The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period of performance for five (5) months plus seven (7) one-month options, for a total potential extended performance period of up to twelve (12) months, from December 1, 2012 through November 30, 2013. The current contractor, MECx, is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA/DFRCs requirements given the potentially short period of performance for the extension.  Award to another source while the competitive process for a follow-on contract is occurring would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Award to another source while the competitive process for the follow-on contract is ongoing would also not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA/DFRCs requirements. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort to the identified point of contact IN WRITING no later than 4 PM PST on November 23, 2012.  Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Far Supplement Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The installation Ombudsman is Patrick C. Stoliker, Patrick.C.Stoliker@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity for Evaluating an Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus
<SOLNBR>NIAID-OTD-2012-002
<RESPDATE>010313
<CONTACT>Maryann T. Puglielli, Ph.D., J.D., Technology Development Specialist, Phone 3015946656, Email maryann.puglielli@nih.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is announcing an opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for evaluating an Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus developed at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) in a clinical setting for the purposes of drug and vaccine development. The NIAID seeks to enter into a CRADA with one or more biotechnology or biomedical companies to evaluate the utility of an Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus developed by NIAID for the purposes of developing influenza drug treatments or vaccines.
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The high seasonal morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza, the continued threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza infections, the development and global spread of antiviral resistance, and the need to plan for future influenza pandemics makes influenza a high priority in infectious disease research. Indeed, approximately 30,000 people die each year from complications due to influenza infection in the U.S. alone. Because animal models of influenza are limited in their ability to replicate human disease, new drug development and the search for better vaccines and vaccine strategies is ongoing and will require significant clinical development. Moreover, many important questions about influenza infection can only be approached through human studies of influenza. In an effort to facilitate these clinical studies, NIAID has developed the Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus, which is a reverse genetics produced, cell cultured wild-type A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus for use in healthy volunteers under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NIAID plans to use its method of reverse genetics and cell culture to produce additional influenza strain preparations for use in human studies.</p>
<p>The Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus stands to streamline and reduce the cost of evaluating candidate vaccines and treatments. Specifically, clinical studies of influenza are expensive and inefficient due to the large numbers of subjects needed to determine efficacy of a new treatment or vaccine, and they are limited in their ability to provide standardized data due to the lack of our ability to identify the timing of viral exposure and development of disease. This inhibits the success of studies and an investigator's ability to evaluate efficacy as well as to study the natural history and pathogenesis of this global disease. Once infection with this challenge virus is characterized in healthy human volunteers, the number of volunteers needed for subsequent efficacy studies will be smaller and the resulting data more informative.</p>
<p>With regard to improving the understanding of influenza infection and the resulting immune response in humans, previous human challenge studies have been used to address some aspects of influenza related illness by evaluating the timing of viral replication, shedding, clinical symptoms, and innate and adaptive immune response. They also proved extraordinarily useful in the development of currently available antivirals. Although the influenza research community clearly identifies a need for these types of studies, in the United States all but 1 published study were performed prior to 1990, and all had limitations due to the scope of the study or the scientific techniques that were available at the time. Currently, no virus for the purpose of study in healthy volunteers is available in the U.S. and these studies are not being performed.</p>
<p>The NIAID Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus will be used to start a program of clinical influenza studies to initially characterize this virus preparation in healthy volunteers. A validated model of infection in these volunteers will allow more efficient and cost-effective phase II clinical development of antivirals and vaccines, as noted above, as well as an opportunity to study correlates of protection and the natural history and pathogenesis of influenza in a controlled setting. Timing of exposure will be known, a standard dose used, and many other potentially confounding variables can be controlled.</p>
<p>A CRADA is the anticipated collaborative agreement to be entered into with NIAID pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified as 15 U.S.C. 3710a, and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities. A CRADA is not a grant, and it is not a contract for the procurement of goods and services. The NIAID is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIAID can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise. The CRADA collaborator can contribute facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funds. The CRADA collaborator will also have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. The goals of the CRADA include the rapid publication of research results and timely commercialization of products, diagnostics, and treatments that result from the research.</p>
<p>CRADA partners are currently being sought to evaluate the utility of the NIAID Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus in a clinical setting for the purposes of drug and vaccine development. These clinical trials will be performed at the NIH Clinical Center. Studies will be designed (1) to meet the specific efficacy testing needs of each individual product under investigation and (2) to further the investigation of influenza related disease. NIAID's clinical principal investigator has extensive experience with running clinical studies of human influenza, working with animal models of influenza, and both classic and molecular virology studies. This principal investigator also has expertise in the area of antiviral resistance and influenza infections in at risk individuals and populations.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: CRADA partners will be expected to have their drug or vaccine well characterized, to have Phase I testing complete, and to have the drug or vaccine approved under an FDA IND prior to clinical studies beginning with the NIAID Influenza A/H1N1 Challenge Virus. In addition, it will be expected that the collaborator would provide funding to supplement the NIAID clinical principal investigator's budget to support this project.</p>
<p>Prospective CRADA partners are expected to provide a written Capability Statement to the contact person indicated in this announcement prior to consideration by NIAID. The Capability Statement must address, with specificity, each of the following selection criteria: (1) a description of the partner's influenza vaccine or therapeutic and its IND status; (2) results of Phase I testing of the vaccine or therapeutic; and (3) ability to perform supporting tests (i.e., immunological testing) relevant to the study; (4) the technical expertise of the partner's Principal Investigator and laboratory group; and (5) the ability to provide adequate and sustained funding to support performance of the research plan throughout the life of the CRADA. NIAID will consider executing a Confidentiality Agreement with a prospective CRADA partner to facilitate receipt of the Capability Statement if requested by a prospective CRADA partner.</p>

<CONTACT>Brenna A. Finkbeiner, Phone 5023156182, Email brenna.a.finkbeiner@usace.army.mil
<DESC>USACE, Louisville District is intending to award a sole source contract to Construction Concepts&nbsp;for a Productivity Study at the Olmsted Dam Project, under FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp; The contractor, Construction Concepts, has already performed similar work associated with productivity planning for the prime contractor, WGA, at the Olmsted site.&nbsp; Construction Concepts is distinctly familiar with the project and staff.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br /><br /><br /><br />Scope of Work
<p>Productivity Planning Services</p>
<p>United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE/Owner) has a contract for construction of a 2,400-foot-long concrete dam across the Ohio River, at river mile 964.4, Olmsted, IL. This contract is a part of the USACE's overall plan to replace the deteriorating Locks and Dam 52 and 53 on the Ohio River.</p>
<p>This is a very complex and long-term project. All parties are especially interested in performing its work as efficiently as possible. Therefore, a review of the role of the Corps' site management and Contractor's management, as well as the relationship between the Contractor and Corps is requested. It is anticipated this will require a minimum of 8 weeks of on-site performance. A pre-meeting, at the field office, will be conducted to review the intent of the observations, surveys, interviews, etc. so that all parties are familiar with the goal of these services.</p>
<p>The Contractor will utilize surveys, interviews with project leaders and direct observation to assess and evaluate the climate and organization across and throughout the Olmsted Dam project site.<br />- Surveys will specifically surface understanding of the production system goals and vision within various levels of the project organizations. They will also analyze the extent to which leadership understands and supports the implementation efforts, and the extent to which the site leadership has created a sense of urgency for and belief in the Construction Project Production Management System (CP2Ms).<br />- Upon completion of the surveys, the results will be tested using interviews and direct observations of production staff meetings and production planning events.</p>
<p>The Contractor's observation and review of the management roles and efficiencies should include:</p>
<p>1. Review the current organizational structure. Focus on the management and team leaders' roles and responsibilities.<br />2. Review the manner and method of the communication structure - how is information flowing internally and externally between the Corps and Contractor throughout the offices. Focus on the communication at the management/team leader level.<br />3. Review both Owner and Contractor's methods/procedures to promote the most efficient process. This will include utilizing on-site meetings, workshops and conferences between subject leads (and others as applicable) from both Owner and Contractor to identify: <br />a. What is required to satisfy both Owner and Contractor policies and regulations, beginning with those identified within the prime contract;<br />b. Review reporting requirements for both Owner and Contractor. Identify areas of efficiency (i.e. duplication) between the offices.<br />c. Timelines for satisfying the goals and objectives;<br />d. Each Party's respective responsibilities for satisfying the goals and objectives;<br />e. Review current performance and output against the goals and objectives identified; and<br />f. Review any efficiencies associated with co-location of Owner and Contractor field personnel.<br />g. Determine what improvements or changes in process or commitments are needed to accomplish all requirements more efficiently.<br />4. Review of the specific team relationships between Corps and Contractor. This includes an overall review of management (partnering, respect, trust, collaboration, etc.), and those relationships as they apply to specific teams (i.e. Quality Assurance with Quality Control).<br />All observations, results and recommendations will be presented in a written report. The report will propose "lean" concepts and culture and include all suggested timelines for the inclusion of such improvements, changes or recommendations. The results of this effort will address a strategy and milestone plan for achieving specific goals and objectives.</p>

<p>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).</p>
<p><br />K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. <br />There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures. The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario. Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide.</p>

<DESC><p>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration <br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities. <br />SOF experimentation focus areas for FY13 triannual TNT events are as follows:<br /><br />- 30 Oct - 8 Nov 2012: Urban Operations at Muscatatuck UTC, IN<br />- 26 Feb - 7 Mar 2013: Digital Soldier at Avon Park, FL<br />- 18-27 Jun 2013: Signature Reduction at Camp Roberts, CA</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts TNT experimentation events at Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Avon Park, Fl, and in cooperation with NPS at Camp Roberts, CA. These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. The event facilitates SOCOM personnel to identify potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be at least Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 but not greater than TRL 6. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 26 Feb 2013-07 Mar 2013, at Avon Park, FL and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in technology for the individual Digital Soldier. Any technology-based experiment conducted at the event will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF operations. Any and all solutions must include all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Digital Soldier technologies may include, but are not limited to: <br /><br />&bull; Situational Awareness (SA) to include combat ID and operations where GPS is not available<br />&bull; Command, Control, Communications &amp; Computers (C4) to include conformable &amp; wearable antennae and wearable computers<br />&bull; Improved Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) and Energy sources, to include wireless, or management devices<br />&bull; Sensors including Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR), biomedical, physiological, etc.<br />&bull; Medicine/Medical/Medic technology applications<br />&bull; Human Performance<br />&bull; Data Integration &amp; Fusion (i.e. from the individual digital soldier to the weapon(s) system(s), the vehicle or other agnostic platform, C2 at multiple echelons, etc.)<br />&bull; Individual soldier combat ready displays, including non-visual means of information display, and potentially utilization of cognitive thoughts and the surrounding environment to display personalized information<br />&bull; Exoskeletons<br />&bull; Ability to make revolutionary improvements in mobility, lethality, survivability and communications</p>
<p>Proposed solutions should take into consideration "lightening the load" of the operator, mentally and/or physically.</p>
<p>An exploratory closed cyber (virtual) network infrastructure, and an Electromagnetic Environment (EME) using electronic spectrum recording can be provided based on expressed interest. Please indicate in the Experiment Objectives Block of the white paper submission form, specific interest to conduct your experiment in either capability.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation nominations.</p>
<p>4. Respondents interested in conducting experiments using technologies like: lasers, explosives, weapons using live fire, moving equipment, vehicles, and other technologies that present an occupational hazard shall prepare and submit a safety risk assessment. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required to bring the resultant risk to a low level. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination. Reference MIL-STD-882D for instructions and information regarding risk assessments. Also, respondents are responsible for ammunition shipments to include an Interim Hazard Classification and coordination for receipt and storage at Avon Park, FL.</p>
<p>If your experiment will be radiating on a given frequency or frequency band, you must have prior approval to transmit on that frequency/frequency band. Prior approval may include compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Title 47, Part 15, a Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the FCC. If equipment is government owned and operating within a Federal Band, you must have National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) frequency approval. Your authority to radiate should be submitted along with your nomination, emailed directly to tech_exp@socom.mil, or presented on site during your equipment pre-check. The FCC recommends you submit your request at least 30 days prior to the start of the event.</p>
<p>5. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATIONS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATION SUBMITTALS FOR THIS RFI WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED UNTIL THE CLOSING DATE OF 12/17/2012 1600 EST. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for FY13 TNT events.</p>

PTSD Service Dog Study 

***THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NO PRICING IS REQUIRED. THE VA IS ONLY SEEKING SOURCES AND INFORMATION. CONTRACTORS ARE WELCOME TO PROVIDE CAPABILITY STATEMENTS AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING FUTURE SOLICITATIONS.***

BACKGROUND

On October 28, 2009, President Obama signed the FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (H.R. 2647) into law, which became Public Law No: 111-84.  The law contains provisions for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to commence a three-year study to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  As part of an ongoing research study, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to partner with one or more contractors that can provide trained, healthy, and confirmationally sound service dogs for Veterans with PTSD. The Public Law states that 200 dogs (at maximum) will be enrolled into this research study. At this time, 17 pairings have already occurred.


REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SUGGESTIONS FROM VENDORS

VA requests comments and suggestions as to how VA can provide the best possible service dogs to veterans enrolled in the study.

VA has encountered difficulty in obtaining consistently well-trained, healthy dogs.  New Veteran/service dog pairings have been delayed twice since initial pairing due to health and behavioral problems on the part of the animals.  These problems have severely delayed completion of the study, and highlighted inconsistencies in the practices of vendors within the service dog community.  The lack of accurate community data on the true rate of dog pairing failures and adverse events has also hampered the study.  

We are now reaching out to both the service and working dog communities to learn about training and health screening best practices that can be applied to service dogs.  Accordingly, VA is very interested in obtaining information from successful and stable service dog and working dog vendors.  

In addition, VA must now limit the interaction between service dog vendor personnel and the Veterans enrolled in the study to reduce bias and ensure that the study team is promptly aware of any problems with a service dog after pairing.  Toward that end, VA expects to utilize its own dog trainers to provide post-pairing support.  VA would also like to solicit feedback on whether trainers hired separately by VA could  perform the pairing procedures in consultation with vendor trainers after receiving an appropriately trained service dog from a vendor.

The original legislation directed VA to pay $10,000 per service dog, but VA will initiate a full and open contract competition with no set payment cap per dog.  Although cost will be only one of the factors used to eventually select the successful bid, it will continue to be an important factor.   

It is important to note that this request for information is for the purposes of this research study only.  

Comments are also welcome by organizations that do not expect to bid for future contracts but are willing to provide information of potential value to VA in successfully completing this study.

MINIMUM CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS

VA seeks contractors that can provide well-trained, healthy dogs that are as free as possible from hip and elbow dysplasia, and as free as possible from other genetic defects that would reduce the effectiveness of a dog in the service role.  The following minimum qualifications will likely be applied to potential contractors:  

"	Demonstrate at least 5 years of experience as an organization in providing trained service dogs or demonstrate how at least 5 years of experience in training working dogs can be leveraged to transition to service dog training. 
"	Commit to training staff on symptoms of PTSD and special challenges that Veterans with PTSD might face during the pairing or follow-up process.
"	Have a history of successfully placing at least 50 dogs, and agree to provide documentation and allow independent verification of those pairings by VA, if requested.
"	Demonstrate use of an effective veterinary health plan on the premises.
"	Demonstrate an effective program to reduce the number of dogs with conformational problems (hip, elbow dysplasia) or other disqualifying genetic defects to the smallest number reasonably possible.
"	Agree to be set up as a VA vendor ("vendorized") so that Direct Deposit payments for invoices can readily be made using the centralized VA vendor payment system. 

REQUESTED INFORMATION

1.  If awarded a contract, how many trained service dogs could be provided in the first and second 12 month periods after the contract begins?  Assume a contract would be signed by June 1, 2013.

2.  Are you a non-profit organization? When was non-profit status awarded?

3.  What breed(s) of dogs would be utilized?

4.  Where do you obtain your dogs (breed your own, buy from established breeders, shelter/rescue)

5.  What methods are in place and completed to ensure that the dogs selected for service are appropriate.

6.  What process is used to train your dog trainers, and how many years of experience do they typically have?

7.  How many years of experience does your organization have training service or working dogs (specify each)?

8.  How many years of experience does your organization have training dogs for PTSD?

9.  Do you provide any guarantees of health or performance ability after a dog has been paired? 

10.  What facilities do you have for training dogs and holding them prior to pairing?

11.  Please describe the training process from birth to pairing.

12.  Describe what tasks your dogs are typically trained to complete, and what tasks you would expect to be helpful to most veterans with PTSD.

13.  Describe any health or wellness practices, and your program of veterinary care.

14.  Would it be possible for trainers hired separately by VA to perform the actual pairings in consultation with your training staff? Describe how you feel that could happen.

15.  What percentage of your pairings have historically failed due to factors attributable to the dog and failed due to factors attributable to the person?

16.  Please describe your pairing procedures- how dogs and people are matched, the length of the pairing procedure, where it is done, and how it is done. If individuals to be paired are expected to come to your facility, what types of accommodations are provided for the individual? Is it expected that support personnel (e.g. significant others) are to attend the pairing as well?  How would you expect to accommodate the needs of people with PTSD (small or individual classes, allowing a caregiver to stay, etc.)?

17.  Describe your capability to provide dogs to a specific region of the country (e.g. Florida)

18.  Describe what your typical requirements are for follow-up training.

19.  If your organization currently does not have experience with service dogs, how would you transition to training service dogs?

20.  Are you willing to transfer ownership of dog to VA immediately and are you willing to take a dog back if necessary?

21.  Do you expect to provide training/education to caregivers/children who will be residing in the home with the veteran and dog?

22.  Do you currently require any type of periodic dog training recertification?

23.  Please provide any additional comments or suggestions you believe would help VA provide the best trained and most appropriate service dogs for veterans in the study with PTSD. 


PROPOSED TASKS - (WILL BE MORE DEFINED UPON THE RELEASE OF A SOLICITATION/ REQUEST FOR QUOTES/REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.)

Task 1- Provide trained service dogs to VA.

 	Task 2 - Document the training and health measures utilized individually for each dog.

<p>57 WINGG/ Foreign Object Damage (FOD) OFFICE located a 4430 Grissom Ave., Nellis AFB, NV 89191 is responsible for continuous/reliable oversight of an approximately 157 aircraft and approximately 22 spare jet engines. <br /><br />A Failure Analysis Service Testing (FAST) support contract is required. This contract will provide for an in-depth failure analysis by determining the root causes of F-15, F-16 and F-22 engine damage only. In determining root cause expensive engine mishaps can be avoided assuring pilot and maintainer safety.</p>
<p>2.0 TECHNICAL SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>2.1 Task Description 1. The contractor will provide technical support during normal duty hours, 5 days a week. When F-15, F-16 and F-22 engines experience FOD, the Government takes a sample of the damaged area using a testing kit supplied by the contractor. The samples will be sent via overnight, standard, secure, commercial shipping service to the contractor where the contractor will perform the necessary analyses to determine the cause of the damage. At times, the Government may also provide the contractor with electronic photographs of damaged engines. The contractor will generate a report of the analysis findings that will be emailed back to Nellis AFB within 7 calendar days. <br /><br />3.0 Facilities and Supplies: The contractor will provide all property, materials, services, and supplies necessary for performance under the resulting contract. This includes, but not limited to the FOD kit, sample dishes, shipping materials and prepaid envelope for overnight shipping service.</p>
<p>Note: Historical&nbsp;data shows that the Govt. requires the contractor to perform<br />analysis testing and reporting services 12- 15 times per year on average.<br />However, historical data&nbsp;also shows that there have been some months where<br />analysis testing and reporting services have been required as much as three<br />times per month.</p>

<p>I. Synopsis<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is conducting market research for R&amp;D efforts that will assist in the determination of the availability of industrial and academic sources. AFRL is seeking potential offerors with the capability and capacity to provide development and test activities in support of AFRL's Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) nano-G accelerometer. The AFRL MEMS nano-G accelerometer uses capacitive sensing and electrostatic actuation of a proof mass suspended by a MEMS spring flexure. The capabilities include measurements of satellite drag-induced accelerations as low as several nano-Gs. Testing is required to validate the instrument's current capabilities. Additional development is needed to meet the needs of AFRL for on-orbit satellite drag measurements at altitudes in the range of 150 - 500 km.</p>
<p>II. Statement of Need<br />This effort will require a potential offeror to have a demonstrable working knowledge of design and manufacturing techniques specifically relating to MEMS accelerometer devices. The scope of the work will require an understanding of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) design and manufacturing, low-noise electronic circuit design, and low-noise data acquisition.<br />The period of performance of this contract is expected to be approximately 60 months from the date of award and is expected to be divided into five (5) major tasks. Each Task is expected to be a &lsquo;stand-alone' task with some overlap from task to task for contract Option purposes. For budgeting purposes, the contract value is expected to be between $350,000 to $450,000 over the total period of performance from contract award date to completion. NOTE! A contract will be pursuant to FAR 52.232-18, Availability Of Funds. <br /><br />III. Task 1. Environmental Testing at AFRL<br />AFRL has an environmental facility designed to minimize building and environmental contributions to the acceleration measurements. The facility is a 40 x 40 ft isolated pad that is about 30 ft deep and isolated from the building. The offeror will:<br />a. Support a one-day measurement at the facility to validate the noise levels of the AFRL MEMS accelerometer.</p>
<p>b. Supply a low-noise data acquisition system capable of measuring voltages as low as 50 nanoV.<br /><br />c. Perform the analysis needed to generate the power spectral density plot of acceleration versus frequency.</p>
<p><br />IV. Task 2. Assemble Additional Devices<br />Assemble four (4) MEMS accelerometer devices from remaining materials of PII SBIR project. Assembly of the devices requires:<br />a. Machining the device housing. <br />b. Assembling the MEMS components.<br />c. Populating and testing the electronic circuit. <br />d. Design and implement measures to increase launch survivability.<br />e. Test and evaluate devices for basic noise levels and sensitivity to DC acceleration.<br />V. Task 3. Identify Any Sources of Stress<br />Investigate sources of stress in the existing device design. This task involves:<br />a. Producing MEMS spring structures for testing. <br />b. Identify any imbalance in spring deflection. <br />c. Trace the origins to MEMS manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>VI. Task 4. Iterate MEMS Fabrication Process<br />Changes to the MEMS device design from previous tasks will be implemented to mitigate any identified problems. <br />a. Update the MEMS photomask design to include results of task 3 and inclusion of launch survivability measures.<br />b. Manufacture additional devices with updated design.</p>
<p>VII. Task 5. Develop and Test Spinning Platform<br />Final stages of manufacturing involve designing and constructing a spinning platform to mechanically shift the low-frequency satellite drag-induced acceleration to a more optimal higher frequency regime. The offeror shall:<br />a. Select an appropriate low-noise motor.<br />b. Design the mechanism for instrument thermal control.<br />c. Design and manufacture the rotating assembly.<br />d.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<DESC>The Naval Postgraduate School, and in particular the Consortium for Robotics and Unmanned Systems Education and Research (CRUSER), utilizes a number of robotic platforms to conduct research in autonomous systems. In order to meet the programs mission, it is imperative the organization have access to similar platforms that perform the various needs of the DoD. 

The current Unmanned Ground Vehicle capabilities are severely reduced in outdoor settings where high-torque and versatility are a must. To meet this capability gap, CRUSER requests the purchase of a robotic platform suitable for outdoor use and with a large enough payload capability to support advanced sensors, some of which are multiple kilograms heavy.

Please see the attached RFQ for the requirements of the robotic system.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity  
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design           
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified   
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The     
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical   
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or    
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate    
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's           
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The  
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering        
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.        
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not     
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have   
 been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally   
 such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
 are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the  
 information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) 
 Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

 These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on 
 your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if    
 this is an item you have never made.     If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS 
 submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request 
 for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required  
 by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data    
 required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award      
 under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval      
 request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval        
 requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet      
 Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based   
 on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification         
 Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<p>(End of Addendum) <br />(ix) FAR Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision are Price, Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, past performance. Basis for contract award: low price technical acceptable with acceptable performance confidence. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, lowest to highest. Technical evaluation shall then be performed on the lowest priced offer and subsequently the performance confidence evaluation shall be performed if the technical evaluation result is an "acceptable" assessment. If the lowest priced offer has an evaluated "acceptable" rating for the Technical factor and an Acceptable Performance Confidence, award will be made to that firm and the evaluation process will stop at that point. If instead the low priced offer has not been assessed an "acceptable" rating for the technical factor or an acceptable assessment for performance confidence, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have an "acceptable" Technical factor rating and an Acceptable Performance Confidence or until all offerors are evaluated. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />a. Price. The offer will be evaluated on the total price of all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) contained in the schedule. Failure to include all prices may exclude the offeror from further consideration for award, as the Government may award without discussions. However, the Government does reserve the right to conduct discussions. The standard for price is met when the price is determined fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>b. Technical Evaluation. Technical evaluation shall be on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, determined based on submittal of acceptable documentation, certifications and past experience using the ratings listed below:<br />Acceptable: Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable: Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. The offeror will be evaluated on the subfactors listed below and the standard is met when the following valid documentation is included in the offer evidence that the offeror is technically capable to successfully provide required items: <br />(i). Certificate of enrollment with the Chamber of Commerce providing the authority of the firm to produce requested items and operate in the specific business sector of the instant solicitation. The documentation must not be older than 90 calendar days from date of offer; <br />(ii). Technical data sheet(s) of proposed products including compliance with current norms and CE certification requirements.<br />(iii) Location of asphalt mixing plant. <br />(iv) Certifications of asphalt mixing plant <br />c. Performance Confidence - Past performance shall be evaluated to determine the offeror's performance confidence as either acceptable or unacceptable: Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offerors will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />The basis for the performance confidence evaluation shall be contractor-provided evidence of performance of contracts for work which is similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to seek past performance information from other sources, such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS). Any additional information will be evaluated in the same manner as offeror supplied references.<br />The Government will rate the offerors performance confidence as follows:<br />(a) Acceptable: The contractor has provided evidence, in the form of two (2) references, of successful contract performance within the last 5 years from the date of the release of the subject solicitation where the Offeror is/was responsible for performing work similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. Information gained from the references and/or information obtained by the Government from other sources reveals acceptable performance.<br />(b) Unacceptable: (i) The offeror has failed to provide evidence, in the form of two (2) references, of successful contract performance within the last 5 years from the date of the release of the subject solicitation where the Offeror is/was responsible for performing work similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. The information gained from the references and/or information obtained by the Government from other sources reveals unacceptable performance. The Contractor was given the opportunity to address negative past performance information by the pertinent assessing official and the unacceptable rating was confirmed. In the event the Offeror was not given the opportunity to address the negative past performance information the Government shall afford the offeror an opportunity to address such information prior to assigning a rating for the instant solicitation; or <br />(ii) the past performance information sought and obtained by the Government reflects other than acceptable performance by the offeror.</p>
<p>The standard for past performance is met when the offeror is determined to have an acceptable performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors must submit, along with their offer, a copy of the completed representations and certifications as prescribed in FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I (Apr 2012) or have current Online Representations and Certification.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives USTDA the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

<p>As part of the Operations Division (OPS), the OFDA Safety and Security Unit (SSU) plays a significant role in the U.S. Government's (USG's) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The SSU assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and UN agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OPS requires the services of a Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) in order to enhance its capability to manage the increasing safety and security issues related to OFDA field deployments.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Safety and Security Specialist's responsibilities will include the following:<br />&bull;	Monitor security situations in countries and regions in which OFDA has, or may have, staff, and identify current and future risks to OFDA staff and programs.<br />&bull;	Provide general and country-specific security guidance and briefings to OFDA staff, as needed. <br />&bull;	Serve as a resource speaker on established SSU training modules at OFDA training courses, as appropriate.<br />&bull;	Deploy to the field in support of OFDA/DRM and regional team operational safety and security needs; conduct comprehensive risk assessments and develop safety and security risk management plans, as necessary.<br />&bull;	Work with OFDA/DRM and regional teams to coordinate and track the activities of OFDA staff as they relate to security.<br />&bull;	Liaise with various elements of USAID, primarily the Office of Security (SEC), in both DART/RMT situations and on relevant USAID security policy, and with Mission Executive Officers when in the field.<br />&bull;	Liaise with other USG agencies in the field and in Washington, D.C., as appropriate, especially with the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Regional Security Officers (RSOs) at post.<br />&bull;	Liaise with the various elements of the humanitarian community in the field and at the headquarters level, including: UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS), UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), local and international non-governmental organizations, members of the International Red Cross / Red Crescent Movement.<br />&bull;	Serve on OFDA DARTs as Safety and Security Officer (or other positions), as required.<br />&bull;	Administer OFDA's Security Information distribution lists.<br />&bull;	Provide expert advice and guidance to DART Safety and Security Officers in developing deployment-specific Security Plans. <br />&bull;	Become certified as Contracting Officer's Representative/Agreement Officer's Representative and assist in the management of security-related grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.<br />&bull;	Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Safety and Security Specialist will report directly to the Safety &amp; Security Coordinator or his/her designee, who, in turn, reports to the OPS Operations Support Team Leader.  He/she will work closely with USAID/SEC, in order to ensure consistency with overall USAID security objectives and the sharing of information between OFDA and SEC.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The incumbent is expected to take initiative, work in a collaborative manner, yet able to act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.  The supervisor will set overall objectives.  The Safety and Security Specialist will work with the Safety and Security Coordinator to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be done.</p>

During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Price evaluation shall be based on the lowest reasonable, balanced, and overall evaluated price. Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes as each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Evaluation of proposals may be made without discussions with the offerror(s). The Government will award a contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the government according to FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>To be considered for this award, offerors must be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov and Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) database at http://wawf.eb.mil prior to award. Lack of registration will make an offeror ineligible for award. This notice does not obligate the Government to award the contract; it does not restrict the Government's ultimate approach; nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any quote/proposal preparation costs. Clauses and provisions incorporated by reference may be accessed via the Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/or http://www.arnet.far.gov/. Quotes must be for all items stated, partial quotes will not be considered. Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. Award will be made (all or none) to one vendor.&nbsp; Submit written quotes; oral quotes and faxes will not be accepted. Quotes may be submitted via e-mail or mailed.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

<DESC><p>Another set of questions was received and EPA has made the decision to respond to them. Any future questions may be answered at the discretion of EPA.</p>
<p><br />The following requirements imply that the air vehicle must be an RPV with an on-board propulsion system:<br />&bull; Automated safe return or rapid landing feature if ground control or wireless connection fails.<br /><em>Comment</em>: Tethered aerostats have no such capability; they do have a rapid deflation device which automatically actuates upon a tether break (per FAA requirement).<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If the Offeror proposes a remotely piloted vehicle, it must include a return to home feature.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Capable of maintaining a fixed position (+/- 10m) wrt to the ground and altitude.<br /><em>Comment</em>: With no active airborne controls, tethered aerostats are subject to winds aloft; in a steady wind, it provides a very stable platform but with wind direction or intensity changes its fixed position may vary more than +/- 10m.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Of course, this performance specification will be subject to wind conditions.<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Can maneuver or be maneuvered to move at 4m/sec (10 mph) in a quiescent atmosphere.<br />Comment: With no active airborne controls, the platform can be moved at 10 mph only by moving the ground mooring systems, i.e., the Gator.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response:</span> The specification for maneuverability must be accomplished independent of any ground mooring system.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Capable of being oriented in relation to the ground and maintaining that orientation.<br /><em>Comment</em>: See second comment above regarding maintaining a fixed position.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Of course, this performance specification will be subject to wind conditions.<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Capable of moving into the wind to a position lateral and perpendicular to its secure point<br /><em>Comment:</em> Tethered aerostats have this capability but only as driven by the prevailing wind. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If a tethered aerostat is proposed, then it must have a means of propulsion independent of any ground mooring system.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Minimal boundary layer or propulsion effect proximal to the payload that will affect gas collection from the payload sampler.<br /><em>Comment</em>: Tethered aerostats have no airborne propulsion systems.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: If a tethered aerostat is proposed, then it must have a means of propulsion independent of any ground mooring system.</strong></p>
<p>Also, your responses to Questions 1 and 2 regarding the maximum operating altitude are a bit confusing. Specifically, in your response to Question 1, it is stated that the system will be operated from a maximum elevation of 5,500 ft ASL. The response to Question 2 states the maximum ground elevation is also 5,500 ft ASL with a required operating altitude of 300 m (~1,000 ft) AGL. Is it correct to assume that the density altitude of the airborne platform is 6,500 ft ASL, i.e., maximum elevation of 5,500 ft ASL + maximum operating altitude of 300 m AGL?<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EPA Response</span>: Yes, 6,500 feet.</strong></p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Solicitation Number: FA4600-12-R-0013</p>
<p>APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: December 2012. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, single award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) with contract for a base period and four (4) one year option periods. In addition, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services will be included. This IDIQ will have the capability to award Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders along with Cost Reimbursement CLINs. Contract Transition period is expected to be 60 days starting approximately between 1 November 2013 and 31 December 2013. The primary goal of the Contractor is to ensure that AFW systems deliver an increasingly higher level of effectiveness, performance (technically, functionally and in terms of customer support), and consistently high operational readiness while reducing ownership costs. The Contractor shall be dedicated to providing world-class, industry standard information technology capabilities. Since sharing information rapidly, reliably and effectively while maintaining proper security integrity is critical to the AFW mission, the Contractor shall maintain the highest quality services and customer support, as an extension or as an enhancement to current capabilities. The design, development and delivery of efficient and reliable systems to reduce ownership costs while improving system performance, combined with strong and up-to-date knowledge of technology solutions are key components of this service. Additionally, the Contractor is expected to be a partner with AFW personnel and a proactive catalyst in continuously improving the effectiveness of AFW systems and the products these systems provide to AFW customers in supporting current and emerging missions. The Contractor is expected to bring the tools, experience, practices and leadership to AFW to move its information technology environment into a proactive, highly customer responsive system following best business practices. Contract personnel performing system administration and system engineering roles must meet the applicable information assurance certification requirements.</p>
<p>Contractor must be able to meet all requirements of the Contract and Task Order Performance Work Statements (PWS's), certification requirements, and appropriate security clearances. Contractor must comply with guidelines specified in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. This project is classified up to Top Secret. Specific contractor employees who require access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) will be required to meet ICD 704 personnel security standards. The number of SCI positions required to perform this IDIQ contract will be approved by the AFWA Special Security Officer based on validated needs. All contractor personnel assigned to perform work under this contract shall have a minimum of Secret security clearance except those assigned to SCI Billets. No waivers will be considered. This acquisition will be conducted using negotiated procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Request For Proposal (RFP) and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry. Draft RFP documents have been posted on the FedBizOpps website. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner.</p>
<p>All associated documents will be released electronically, except for the Technical Library DVD established for the SEMS III solicitation. The library is composed of technical, architecture, and schematic information. One copy of the Technical Library DVD will be provided to each prospective company. The Technical Library will contain Unclassified For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, documents that are on AFWA's OPSEC Critical Information List and some are considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Because of this, the technical library will only be released to companies that currently hold a Facility Clearance (FCL). To obtain a copy, please send your company's name and Cage Code to both Stacy Mazurek at stacy.mazurek@offutt.af.mil and Brian Stricker at brian.stricker@offutt.af.mil so the Government can verify your company has a FCL. Once your FCL is verified, 55 CONS will send out a notification that your company can obtain a copy of the Technical Library DVD. A completed and signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) must be completed by the person receiving/picking up the DVD (see attachment posted with this synopsis). The NDA must be returned to 55 CONS either prior to or provided at the pickup date/time arranged with 55 CONS. If multiple people in the Contractor's organization/team have a need to know or require access to the Technical Library Data, each person must fill out a NDA and return it to 55 CONS. If an interested company is not in the local area, 55 CONS will mail out a copy of the Technical Library DVD after the FCL is verified and a NDA is received from the recipient. The NAICS code is 541512, and the size standard is $25.5M. Anticipated award date is Fall 2013. Address questions via e-mail only to both Stacy Mazurek at stacy.mazurek@offutt.af.mil and Brian Stricker at brian.stricker@offutt.af.mil. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 02 TO THE RFI ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2012<br />ADDITIONAL MCF QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY<br />Responses due NLT 3 December 2012 to Mr. Ronald Foskey at <a href="mailto:ronald.foskey@eglin.af.mil">ronald.foskey@eglin.af.mil</a>.<br /><br />1. The government's need for a modernized fuze is based on an assumption that the industrial supplier base will not be able to provide affordable, high quality components for the current Electro-mechanical design over the long-term (20+ years). What is your perspective on this assumption? <br /><br />2. General Industry consensus is there would be a substantial cost increase if the captive carry requirement is changed from 100 external/200 internal to 900 hours. What does industry consider a reasonable captive carriage hour requirement that optimizes cost/schedule impact? Does the fuze or the FZU design drive the extended captive carriage costs/schedule, or both equally?<br /><br />3. If the government deleted the long function delay time requirement, explain to what extent that would lower your development and production costs?<br /><br />4. If the government eliminated the FFCS requirement, how would that impact your projected cost and schedule for developing the fuze?<br /><br />5. Considering the need for affordability, at what quantity (or quantities) would sharp increases in unit price begin to occur? Why? What strategies are there to lessen these increases?<br /><br />6. As part of the acquisition strategy, the government is considering options to include testing of the performance of prototype fuze systems as part of the source selection process. This could either be part of the basic proposal evaluation, or it could involve a rolling down select to 2-3 suppliers for a 12-18 month demonstration effort to a final downselect. Key evaluations points will be current FMU-152A/B specification performance with hardened target capability and multi-layer survivability. How long would it take you to provide 10 test items for evaluation? What would be the ROM cost for those test items?<br /><br />7. What are your thoughts on industrial base impacts of a joint modernization program with the Navy; versus two separate programs, Air Force and Navy?<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br /><br />

<DESC><p>Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), 483 North Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, California, 90245-2808 intends to issue a sole-source firm-fixed-price contract action to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services, Los Angeles, California, 90056-1299, to provide Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) support services to SMC/GP for up to 6 months beginning 8 March 2013. The maximum period of performance is 8 Mar 2013 until 7 Sep 2013. SMC/GP will not continue performance of this contract beyond the time needed to award and transition to the follow-on contract. Award of a follow-on contract is expected in May 2013. This contract action will effectively extend the period of performance of the SE&amp;I services currently being acquired under Contract FA8807-12-C-0010, thereby providing SMC/GP sufficient time to complete a source selection, award a long-term follow-on contract, and allow sufficient transition time between the existing contract and the follow-on contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 5.207(e), the classification code for this synopsis is R (Professional, Administrative and Management Support Services). Pursuant to FAR Section 5.207(c)(6), approximately 185,956 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using Air Force, RDT&amp;E and Missile Procurement, appropriations. A copy of the existing Statement of Work (SOW) is appended herewith for reference.</p>
<p>This contract will provide a highly capable SE&amp;I contractor/team to produce and manage the GPS technical baseline in support of SMC/GP. The SE&amp;I's role in the accomplishment of this mission will involve, but is not limited to, development and implementation of directives and standards, improved and dynamic communications, new tools and techniques to predict issues early enough to change the outcome or minimize the effect on the enterprise, disciplined processes to develop and maintain the systems baseline documents and interfaces, and performance metrics that ensure continuous integration and operational capability improvements (measures of effectiveness). The current contract was awarded 8 May 2012. All options have been exercised and the contract will expire on 8 March 2013.</p>
<p>This contract action will be awarded to SAIC S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services as the only responsible source that can continue to provide these highly specialized services, as it is likely that award to any other source would result in the Air Force incurring substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition, experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements, or both. (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 14 days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis, which shall be considered by the agency. The SOC must include the following information: Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification (Large, Small, or Other), Personnel/Size Standard and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Interested parties must demonstrate in their SOC they have the capability to provide the systems and services to fulfill the government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. Interested parties must also demonstrate how an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment activities described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein.

<DESC>The Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) Specialized Contracting Branch is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested sources to provide C-32 Pilot Training support for the Air Mobility Command. Part of the market research is to publish on FedBizOpps a Request for Information (RFI) seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services, as described herein, as well as on terms and conditions relevant to this potential procurement. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force (AF) to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to his RFI are cautioned that this RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).<br /><br />This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a RFP. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information provided in response to this RFI.<br /><br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The AF will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code to be used for this procurement is 611512, Flight Training, with a size standard of $25.5M. This requirement is a potential follow-on to Contract #FA4452-09-D-0001, currently being performed by Flight Training International. The Government is contemplating use of a Requirements contract type with Firm-Fixed-Price CLINs for training on a per student basis, additional simulator time, and simulator position fill-ins. However, as no acquisition plan has been approved, the procurement strategy is subject to change. Additionally, there is currently no timeframe for potential RFP release. Approximate start date, assuming a contract is issued, would be 1 Oct 2013.<br /><br />INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />1. Company Information: Name, address, telephone number, point of contact names, e-mail addresses, CAGE code, and small business status (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.).<br /><br />2. Major Risks: Identify any major performance, schedule, or cost risks anticipated.<br /><br />3. Supporting information which demonstrates your capabilities to meet all or some of the tasks specified in this RFI Draft PWS. Supporting information shall not reiterate the language of the tasks provided above, but rather, it shall provide details regarding your company's capabilities to execute these tasks. A cross-reference matrix is requested which links the task to the supporting information provided. Past performance information that is related to the tasks in the Draft PWS is requested if available.<br /><br />4. State whether you own the FAA certified flight simulator or plan to lease it from another company. Provide information on the level and CAT capability of the simulator being used.<br /><br />5. Commentary/recommendations for improving or clarifying draft PWS requirements.<br /><br />6. If a small business under the identified size standard, please indicate the approximate percentage of the requirement your firm is able to perform. If a large business, please identify an appropriate percentage, if any, for small business subcontracting opportunities.<br /><br />7. Submission Information. Your submission must be clear, concise, complete, and be submitted via e-mail by 2:00 pm CST on 13 Dec 2012 to Mr. Nicholas Smothers (nicholas.smothers@us.af.mil) and Mr. Evan Port (evan.port@us.af.mil).<br /><br />-------------------------Please See Attached Performance Work Statement (PWS)---------------------<br />

Program activities include institutional capacity building, professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives, improving gender justice services, expanding legal aid services, fostering coordination within the criminal justice system, increasing public awareness and access to justice, and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to provide alternative dispute resolution.<br />B.

The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.<br />Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.

They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.<br />Physical Demands<br />In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty, windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>Period of Performance <br />The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew for up to 4 years.</p>
<p>D. POSITION ELEMENTS</p>
<p>The Justice Sector Advisor will be under the leadership and direction of the U.S. Embassy-Kabul INL Section's (INL/Kabul) Director and Deputy Director, reporting through the INL/Kabul Justice Team Lead.

<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT WALKING BOX: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has completed the contract documents (plans and specifications) and will be soliciting construction proposals for the adaptive reuse/redevelopment of an historic resource known as Walking Box Ranch, as well as, the new construction of a small research and learning campus on site.
The ranch is located west of Searchlight, Nevada, just south of Highway 164.  The project involves the sensitive adaptation of the resource to accommodate public visitation while maintaining the historic integrity of the site and structures.   Another separate, yet integral, element of this undertaking is the development of a field research facility to be operated by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) on a portion of the site outside of the designated historic zone.  Interpretive exhibits will be concentrated in areas open to the visiting public.  Utilities and infrastructure will need to be developed.  The development involves 40 acres in the northwest quadrant of a larger 120-acre, protected parcel.  Sensitive treatment of the developed area and methods to control impact upon the adjacent protect areas is part of this undertaking.
The project consists of, but is not limited to, the stabilization, rehabilitation, and preservation of the following (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Installation of a rock garden to its historic context; 2. Selective demolition and the historic preservation of a 5000 sf ranch house 3. The rehabilitation of a 1500 sf existing bunkhouse and the addition of approx. 600 sf to create a new 2100 sf administration building; 4. The preservation of a 2100 sf barn; 5. The stabilization of a 120 sf ice house.
The project also consists of, but is not limited to, the new construction of (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Extensive site improvement work (grading, vehicular and pedestrian hardscape, utilities and infrastructure, fencing, tortoise habitat fencing, landscape, etc.) of the 40 acre site; 2. A 4300 sf research, classroom, lab facility; 3. A 7700 sf bunkhouse with kitchen facility; 4. A 300 sf campground pavilion; 5. A 1200 sf caretaker residence and garage structure; 6. A 900 sf maintenance facility; 7. A 120 sf blacksmith shop.
This is an educational facility dealing with environmental themes.  It is therefore essential that this undertaking be constructed using sustainable practices.  The project must be registered for certification under a nationally recognized green rating system.  Criteria for evaluating the success of having achieved a sustainable development will be guidance from a rating system such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, or equal.
The construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

UNDER NAICS CODE 541519.&nbsp; <br /><br /></strong>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Contracting Department is currently planning to procure an Integrated Library Service (ILS) that includes software and services. The tentative acquisition strategy is a Small Business Set-Aside competed amongst General Services Administration (GSA) schedule holders. The ILS is a library management system that tracks, acquires, circulates, and catalogs hardcopy and digital data in the NGA libraries for user access. The solution sought needs to enable discovery, collection, storage, assessment, and cataloging of non-standard, geospatial and non-geospatial source data, including open sources, commodity, and selected geospatial data on all network domains. "ILS Next" will support utilization, operation, and maintenance at two primary locations, one near Springfield Virginia, and one in Saint Louis. The attached draft SOW provides the software requirements for the software package which is being procured to replace the current solution. The proposed acquisition will be conducted under either North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541519, size standard is $25M, or 519120, size standard $7M. In 5 pages or less, interested firms shall complete and submit the following information: (A) A summary document to demonstrate the organizations financial and technical capability to perform the tasks listed in the draft SOW. (B) Relevant Past Performance to address the company's experience in performing tasks (maximum of 5 contracts) that are relevant to those described in the draft SOW. (C) Your organization's business size under NAICS 541519 and NAICS 519120 (large business, small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, 8(a), small disadvantaged small business, and/or woman owned small business). Proprietary information submitted will be protected, when so designated. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up requests. In addition to the five (5) page limitation notated above, potential bidders are requested to provide comments and/or questions regarding the draft SOW. No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged. There is no solicitation available at this time.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) has issued Modification 4 under the terms of the RFP to alert interested parties of a discrepancy in the Draft Master Lease which requires the Master Lessee to submit a Repair and Maintenance Plan within thirty (30) days of the Lease Effective Date as provided in the Lease LGOGA009-13. To complete the Repair and Maintenance Plan, the Master Lessee will need to have a Condition Assessment Report for the Premises. For the Master Lessee to be able to comply with this requirement, there needs to be an additional 30 days added to the due date requirement. There is a possibility that GGNRA will be able to contract for the Condition Assessment Reports in advance of executing the Lease. Thus the Draft Lease posted to the website will not be changed at this time. The change would occur, if necessary, during lease negotiations. The approximate submittal date requirement would be extended by thirty (30) days as described in Section 11.2 Repair and Maintenance Plan. New language would read, "Within sixty (60) days of the Lease Effective Date and annually thereafter on the anniversary date of Lease Effective Date." The Draft Lease is posted to the website at http://www.nps.gov/goga/index.htm.
All other due dates remain the same as specified in the RFP.  Any proposals must be received by the National Park Service, Pacific West Region, Attn:  Commercial Services Office, 333 Bush Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, California 94104.

  The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range.  The design build budget amount is $218,500,000. 

This solicitation is open to both large and small businesses provided that they are US firms with US design teams.  The design team shall be US Citizens.  A portion of the facility shall be constructed by US citizens with an adjudicated final SECRET security clearance.  

This contract will require a Performance Bond pursuant to FAR 52.228-15 through an approved surety under the United States Treasury Department Circular 570. 

Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on or about 26 November 2012.  Proposal due date will be on or about January 10, 2013, 2:00 p.m.
 Eastern Standard Time North America.

The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.203 for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

This solicitation will consist of two (2) phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.
  The Navy will determine which offerors proceed to Phase II.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows: Technical Approach, Experience and Past Performance.  Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive an RFP containing current and future design specifications.  Phase II will include the following evaluation factors: Safety, Technical Solution, Energy and Sustainable Design, and Schedule.  

*A site visit to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti will be required for this procurement.  Offerors will have the opportunity for a site visit during Phase I or Phase II of the solicitation.  Due to the geographic location of this site, it is recommended that interested firms make pre-arrangements for travel (immunizations, etc.), base access and any other necessary requirements for overseas travel, as the Phase I solicitation will be limited to 45 days and the Phase II solicitation will be limited to 60 days.*

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.neco.navy.mil and www.fbo.gov.
  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  All contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and will be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website(s) periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of the contract.
  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.  The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov.  Reference is made to FAR Clause 52.204-99 (DEV), System for Award Management Registration (August 2012) (DEVIATION).  You are encouraged to register as soon as possible.  All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in SAM. This requirement will apply to all solicitations and awards, regardless of the media used.

<DESC>The objective of this effort is to design and develop an LWIR hyperspectral imager coupled with data processing algorithms for non-contact, passive standoff detection of liquid contaminants on surfaces. Improved SCR (Signal-to-clutter ratio) will be examined using new algorithms and polarization-enhanced hyperspectral methods.  An optional LWIR illumination sub-system will be examined for contrast enhancement. The on-the-move approach will be demonstrated using liquid agent simulant particles of relevant sizes.

<DESC>The objective of this effort is to perform spectral measurements of chemical stimulants and develop a system model and design of a hyperspectral imaging system based upon the measurements. Hyper-spectral datacubes for stimulants and system specifications will be developed. The ultimate goal is the development of a passive standoff hyperspectral long wavelength infrared (LWIR) focal plane array (FPA) with a polarimetric capability that can exploit cold sky reflectance, and spectroscopy techniques to identify CB agents quickly, accurately, and on the move.

<DESC>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified . electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.
<p>&nbsp;The initial purpose of this initiative was to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. The initial data was obtained from the 12-month cost report filed at that time. As cost reports are continually accepted during the year, MAC's shall update the data in the FISS within 5 business days of acceptance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to continue these efforts</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because of uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permits costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>
