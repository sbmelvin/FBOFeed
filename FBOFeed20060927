<DESC>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is seeking comments and suggestions from industry for the attached DRAFT for the Integrated Security Services Contract for the Department of Defense in the National Capital Region, including the Pentagon.  The Integrated Security Services Contract (ISSC) is a total system approach to automating and improving the physical security system used to protect Department of Defense (DoD) sites including, the Pentagon, and sites within the National Capitol Region (NCR).  ISSC emphasizes the use of computer-based solutions to meet security requirements and integrates the operation of multiple subsystems to improve efficiency and control.  Functions and processes within ISSC are divided into 9 major subsystem categories which are: a) common support systems, b) command, control, & communications systems, c) access control systems, d) intrusion detection systems, e) assessment systems, f) video badging systems, g) Active/Passive barrier systems, h) Security Booths, Kiosks and Bullet Resistant Components (BRC), and i) Screening Devices.  The objective of the ISSC is the design, procurement, installation, training, and maintenance of automated, integrated physical security systems for multiple DoD sites.  The overriding design requirement for each of the computer-based subsystems within ISSC shall use open systems design concepts, which are compatible with existing systems (All renovated space has the AMAG system installed and monitored. Legacy space has a combination of DAQ or MDI brand installed and monitored. When the Pentagon renovation project is completed (estimated 2011) all alarms monitored will be AMAG. Any new alarm system to be installed is currently programmed to be the AMAG brand, current or upgraded).  Open systems are those that conform to open specifications for interfaces, services, and supporting formats.  This conformance enables properly engineered subsystems to be easily integrated into a wide variety of systems with minimal changes to interoperate with other subsystems.  Integration of the various computer-based subsystems shall be accomplished through compliance with standard interfaces defined by standards bodies such as ISO, ANSI, IEEE, and applicable DOD Regulations.  Adherence to this design philosophy is intended to foster the overall objective of effectively and efficiently designing, procuring, installing, operating, and maintaining automated, integrated physical security systems through the benefits of interoperability and scalability.  A Top Secret Facility clearance is required and all personnel will require either a Secret or Top Secret clearance.  This draft RFP and SOO is being issued to gather comments and suggestions from industry prior to issuing the final RFP.  All comments/suggestions will be considered and evaluated in developing the final RFP.  Any comments/suggestions that are received will not be made available to anyone outside of the Government personnel involved in developing the RFP and SOO.  Responses to this notice must be by e-mail.  Responses to this notice are due by October 5, 2006.     Send your response and any questions to chris.carlson.ctr@whs.mil and brad.l.westergren.ctr@whs.mil.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH forDevelopment and Delivery of Design and Traffic Operations (OPS)Training
 

The Government is conducting market research to:

?	Determine if responsible, qualified, capable sources exist that are interested in satisfying the Government?s requirements described below;
?	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices; 
?	Determine size and status of potential sources; and
?	Determine the nature of competition (e.g. 8(a), small business set-aside or full and open)

The National Highway Institute (NHI), within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT), plans to award task orders under multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development, revision, and presentation of training courses in the areas of Design and Traffic Operations, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and Freight Transportation Logistics.  The work requires skilled, knowledgeable, experienced subject matter experts and instructional designers working together to develop and update course materials, and instructors who possess adult learning facilitation skills and credible subject matter expertise. 

The NHI is the technical training arm of the FHWA, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA?s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  NHI courses respond to changing workforce development requirements and are a part of the technical professional development of engineers, planners, and others in the surface transportation industry.  The target audience for these courses is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), universities, and other national and international entities engaged in highway operations of interest to the United States.

The NHI maintains a training curriculum of approximately 135 courses and presents over 600 training sessions per year to more than 15,000 participants nationwide.  For each session, NHI provides course materials and instructors who are trained in the presentation of learner-centered, interactive course facilitation and highly qualified in their technical fields.  NHI courses in the Operations areas are currently taught by university faculty with advanced degrees, professional transportation planners, highway and signals designers, current and former FHWA engineers, very experienced professional engineers (PE) and combinations thereof.

NHI courses are varied and support many customer needs.  They are an integral part of development activities for graduate engineers in many states as they learn about transportation engineering and prepare for professional licensure.  Additionally, because NHI emphasizes the implementation of new research, standards, and procedures, many courses are directed toward experienced, practicing engineers.  NHI awards International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) Continuing Education Units (CEUs) to those who must earn professional development hours to maintain their license.  Some NHI courses have prerequisites that are part of state certification curricula.

In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission, it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended messages, thus improving attendees skills and knowledge. Since Congress established the NHI in 1970 it has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topics. 

In addition to instructor-led classroom training, NHI is developing distance-learning offerings.  NHI has an active web conferencing system that delivers instructor-led synchronous web conference training directly to participant workstations.  Self-paced web-based training is also offered, as well as a blended approach of all three methodologies.  Considering the complexity of the technical subject matter, NHI believes the flexibility of the blended learning model has great potential for reaching a large national audience in the future.  To this end, NHI and the Office of Operations will be looking to improve and expand this capability during the life of the new ID/IQ.  

NHI?s goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within defined constraints. Part of this process involves development of material precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes.  The principles of adult learning and instructional systems design (ISD) must be incorporated into the courses, as well as a learning assessment (i.e. post tests, exercise, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET requirements.  Training includes a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, and group exercises/discussions.  To meet this goal, the contractor will be required to provide a development team consisting of both Instructional Systems Designers and Subject Matter Experts to design and develop new courses, and update and enhance existing ones. 

The contractor will be required to provide highly qualified, experienced, approved instructors to teach these courses. To be truly effective, instructor led training requires skilled, competent, knowledgeable, credible, instructors with adult education experience. All instructors are required to be NHI certified or achieve instructor certification by an NHI Master Trainer within one year of being accepted as an NHI instructor.  Potential instructors with limited or no classroom teaching experience must begin the certification process by attending the NHI Instructor Development Course and completing the Web-based NHI Instructor Development Module for Web Conference Training. The procedure for becoming certified is explained more fully on the NHI Web site, http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/.

From time to time, those awarded an ID/IQ contract will be invited to compete for task orders that may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included. 

Performance under the Task Orders is subject to the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998. Section 504 deals with accessibility for all participants in training classes. Section 504 specifically addresses classroom settings, course materials and accommodations for special needs. Section 508 addresses accessibility issues relative to electronic media such as web postings, web sites, computer simulations, and videos. 

The NHI follows Section 504/508 Compliance in all of its training development and delivery efforts. The NHI and its contractors must, to the greatest degree possible, meet all accessibility needs of its participants. 

NHI course offerings currently covered by expiring ID/IQ contracts in the area of Traffic Operations/ITS and Freight (series numbers are:  133XXX, 137XXX, and 139XXX), as well as the NHI style guide (both instructor lead and distance learning) may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional related courses or web-based offerings may be added as needs are defined.

5) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 

6) project direction and hiring, training, and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 

7) identification of study subjects, including locating cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files;

10) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 

11) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a Cold Plate Spray Assembly (quantity required 1 each)  Specifications: The assembly must cool a 60/40 propylene glycol/water mixture from 42 C to 13 C.  The open loop coolant for the receiving side is potable water and a spray cooling process must be used. The steam must be able to exhaust to a high vacuum environment, 1 X 10E-12 torr.  The allowable volume of the assembly is 30 cubic centimeters.   Pressure drop of the propylene glycol/water mixture is as low as possible but less than 75 kPa for the assembly, including headers.  The weight of the entire assembly must be less than 20 kg.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the item from Parker Hannifin Corporation.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	The Cold Plate Spray Assembly technology is proprietary to Parker Hannifin Corporation and therefore only Parker Hannifin would be able to supply the item needed.  Therefore it would be the best interest of the government to purchase directly from Parker Hannifin.  Pursuant to NFS 1805.207 and 1804.570, this proposed contract action will be published on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and pursuant to FAR 5.201, this proposed contract action will be synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily.  The results received in writing will be added to this document by addendum.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12 noon local time on 9/29/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<ARCHDATE>11122006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Dr. Larry Roesner to provide the SWMM user community with a Runoff Applications Manual that describes how SWMM can be applied to estimating runoff quantity and quality for a number of modeling situations commonly encountered in practice for the U.S. EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.  The current NAICS code is 541710. Based on the EPA's knowledge of the Technical Support  needed for the Statement of Work (SOW) there may be unique capabilities to particular contractors/consultants.  The SOW is as follows: SWMM Runoff Applications Manual Background The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a dynamic rainfall-runoff simulation model used for estimating the quantity  and quality of storm water runoff and combined sewer overflows from primarily urban areas. A new, updated version of SWMM was recently developed by the Water Supply and Water Resources Division of EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory (see http://www.epa.gov/ednnrmrl/models/swmm). It  has been well received by the storm water modeling community, with its web page being among the most frequently visited among all those maintained by EPA's Office of Research and Development. One consequence of this has been an increase in the numbers of new users of the program. Although SWMM's  documentation includes a Users Manual that describes the mechanics of using the program, one enhancement that users have requested, especially the less experienced ones, has been for more "nuts and bolts" case study examples that show them how to apply SWMM to various types of storm water  management problems. The intent of this project is to fulfill this need. Purpose The purpose of this project is to provide the SWMM user community with a Runoff Applications Manual that describes how SWMM can be applied to estimating runoff quantity and quality for a number of modeling situations  commonly encountered in practice. The manual will be written in a how-to style utilizing a case study approach. It is anticipated that a complementary manual covering runoff flow and quality routing will be contracted for in a separate project. Tasks The contractor shall identify 4 to 6 topics  that will serve as suitable case studies to be described in the manual. The topics should emphasize modeling scenarios that would be of common interest to a wide range of storm water modelers and shall include: how to obtain SWMM runoff input data from readily available data sources (e.g.  topographic drawings, government databases, etc.), how to model infiltration-based BMPs (e.g. disconnecting roof drains, vegetative buffer strips, etc.), how to compare pre- and post-development conditions using continuous simulation. The contractor shall develop a common presentation format to  use when describing the case studies. It is anticipated that each case study will form a separate chapter in the manual. The topic explored by each case study should be encapsulated into a SWMM data set of an appropriate size so that readers can easily follow the procedures used to create the  data set and analyze its simulation results. Each data set shall be analyzed using the SWMM program and a discussion of the analysis results shall be included. As the manual is purely tutorial in nature it is permissible to use synthetic data when developing the case studies. Deliverables Two  months after the order is awarded the contractor shall deliver an Interim Report to the EPA that identifies the case study topics that will be contained in the Applications Manual along with the general approach used to develop each case study. One essentially completed case study should be  included in the report to serve as an example for what the others might look like. Six months after the order is awarded the contractor shall deliver a draft of the full SWMM Runoff Applications Manual to the EPA PO in electronic format, as either a Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect file, for  review and comment. Eight months after the order is awarded the contractor shall deliver the final SWMM Runoff Applications Manual document to the EPA PO in electronic form as either a Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect file, for review and approval.  In addition, all data files used for the  case studies shall be supplied in electronic format. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within  15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 6.302-1) with Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46250 as the only responsible source that can provide diagnostic kits including precision equipments used for in-vitro nucleic acid amplification and quantization of HIV type I RNA;  Nomenclature:  Amplicor HIV Monitor kit, #21118560018. Specifically, NMCSD Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory along with the Infectious Disease Wards has established a required test range of 50 to 100,000 copies per milliliter.  Roche Diagnostics is the only manufacturer of ultra sensitive HIV monitoring test kits with a dynamic range of 50 to 100,000 copies per milliliter. Roche Diagnostics Corporation manufactures the diagnostic kits and reagents used for in-vitro nucleic acid amplification and quantitation of HIV type I RNA (nomenclature:  Amplicor HIV Monitor kit, #21118560018). Roche Diagnostics, provides controls, reagents, and equipment used in assessing viral response to anti-retroviral treatment.  The Navy has an established test range accuracy of 50 to 100,000 copies per milliliter.  Roche Diagnostics Corporation is the only manufacturer in the US of ultra sensitive HIV monitoring diagnostic kits and reagents with the required dynamic range. The diagnostic kits are used to diagnose patients who may have a terminal illness. Changing to another manufacturer will result in having to completely stop current methodologies of testing to validate /correlate the new system and new consumables. This will disrupt patient continuity of care, because validation studies is a very tedious process and takes significant time before patient?s reports have results. The current HIV method  being used is a  PCR quantitative methodology. The quantitation of results is needed by our Infectious Disease doctors to monitor therapy for known HIV patients.
 
Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable items are the diagnostic kits including precision equipments used for in-vitro nucleic acid amplification and quantization of HIV type I RNA; Nomenclature: Amplicor HIV Monitor kit, #21118560018.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a  Small Business Size Standard of 100 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 1 day after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Richard Taylor at rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil. Statements are due by 1600 (4:00 PM) Eastern Time 28 SEPT 06.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, fax number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                   September 06
Presolicitation Conference          September 06
RFP Release                         October 06
Contract Award                      May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration

<DESC>This is Amendment 3 to the RFP.  Responses to submitted technical questions are hereby being provided to all potential offerors.  Please note that the proposal due date of Thursday, October 12, 2006 is NOT being extended as a result of this amendment.  Additional responses are being prepared for other solicitation questions that were submitted.  These responses will also be posted by amendment.    

RESPONSES TO SOLICITATION QUESTIONS



1. Refer to 4.1.2.1	External Interfaces ...

The prototype ODRP unit has a physical and electrical interface to some type of aerial vehicle.  The physical attachment shall be by two tie points located near the two ends of the longest side of the package.  These points shall be such that they can be securely attached by suitable fasteners with necessary characteristics to perform for at least 10 days in the high-altitude environment.  The prototype ODRP unit shall be powered by 12 volt DC normally supplied from the aerial vehicle.  After contract award, the Government will entertain discussion on possible no-cost changes to either the physical or electrical external interfaces for the prototype ODRP unit.

Q1. "We need better understanding on the ODRP mechanical interface.  Would the government please provide a drawing or sketch of the proposed ODRP mechanical interface? Two tie points seems perhaps like not enough.  For example, is the ODRP intended to be external or internal to the UAV?  Where can we mount antennae?"

R.1. As stated in the RFP, the Government has not selected an aerial vehicle for this application.  For purposes of the ODRP mechanical interface, assume that the vehicle is a super pressure balloon with a payload that is a one meter cube with vertical and horizontal sides capable of supporting the ODRP.  


Q2. "For the sonde release mechanism, we have the same mechanical interface questions (e.g. is the UAV external skin curved? Is it thin aluminum? What sort of backing is available for tie points? Can we tie to the frame rather than the skin?) A suggested drawing would help"

R.2. Delivery of a sonde release mechanism is not called for in this RFP.  The only requirement relating to a sonde release mechanism is a conceptual design.  For this conceptual design, assume flat surfaces oriented horizontally and vertically are available to mount to.


Q3: "Could you provide a target for the expected G-forces on landing/takeoff of the UAV?  This relates to statements that our ODRP needs to accommodate the temp/vibration environment on a UAV.  Temperature seems pretty well defined, but vibration is not. Please define expected vibration environment."

 R.3. The flight tests of the Ultra-light Dropsonde System will be conducted using hand-launched lighter-than-air balloons and the maximum acceleration and vibration forces will normally be less than 4 G. 
 
Q4. "For the receiver on the UAV how much current is available at 12Vdc and at what duty cycle?"

R.4. Current specification is part of the design for the UDS and the requirement should be given in the proposal.  The Government will assure that capability is provided for the testing.
 
Q5. "What is the AC ripple on UAV 12Vdc power?"

R.5. The maximum AC ripple that the proposed UDS can tolerate should be given in the proposal and the Government will assure that the voltage supplied during testing has AC ripple less than this.
 

Q6. "What is the +/- DC voltage tolerance on UAV 12Vdc power?" Typical satellite data modems have very tight limits on DC supplies. We may need a bulky/expensive DC-DC converter if the UAV power is not clean and stable. Need more information on DC power available from UAV.

R.6. The proposer should provide the voltage tolerance that is required by the proposed UDS and the Government will assure that the voltage used in testing has this tolerance.


Q7. "A 300km range is stated for RF. Why such a long range? Is it to let another loitering aircraft (i.e. P3 or Gulfstream-V) cruising very high up can contact the data receiver on the UAV? Sitting on the earth's surface, 300km is far beyond the range of any UAV at realistic flight altitudes. If it is intended to provide adequate data link margin? If yes, could you provide a SNR specification or bit error rate, rather than range? At issue is how to aim the UAV antenna at the ground station as the UAV moves around. Also, related to this, for unlicenced point-to-point telemetry links, low power unlicenced operation will not work to 300km. Does the government propose to get a licensed frequency for this link and if so could they suggest a suitable UHF data modem?"

R.7. If a direct radio link to the surface is used, the Government desires to be able to receive data from ranges at least 300 km from shore stations. This is well within the approximately 500 km line of sight from 60,000 feet altitude to the horizon.  The design of this communication link is part of the proposal process and it is not appropriate for the Government to ?suggest? specific equipment or configurations.  The Government will obtain experimental frequency allocations for testing.


Q8. "A maximum height of 25000 meters is stated for altitude. Getting altitude via GPS is no problem, however, that altitude is far, far higher than a UAV can fly [see U2/ER-2]. And even much higher than required for hurricane sounding work. Later in the RFP, chamber testing is discussed simulating conditions to 25000m. This appears to be aimed at for balloon verification/testing to extreme latitudes. However, the design target is not for a balloon sonde (radiosonde) but rather it needs to be highly weight/size-optimized for lower tropospheric hurricane work (hence the "utlralight" in UDS!) Why is this height spec set so high? will we be expected to fly this on a balloon for testing to 25000m or is it simply for GPS height."

R.8. Super pressure, zero pressure or latex balloons can fly at 25000 meters and above.  The flight testing done by the Government will involve flying latex balloons to heights near 25000 meters.
 

Q9. "Temperature specification of RMS 0.3 on the sonde, first is it +/- 0.3? And does this include solar radiation effects? What are the actual conditions, a lab test in a temp chamber? What about radiative cooling if sensor is wet?

R.9. RMS stands for root-mean-square and is, generally, not considered to be negative.  All error sources normally encountered in atmospheric measurements should be included in the analysis and design.


Q10: "It is stated that the sonde sensors, including temperature will be verified in an environmental test chamber. How can one make simulate air temperatures to this level somehow ensuring air homogeneity to better than 0.03 degrees? If no, how are we to verify our temp sensor performance? In nearly all commercial temperature chambers is nearly impossible. In our experience the only valid method to intercompare thermistors is to use a NIST-traceable liquid bath for calibration, not a chamber air temperature measurement which will change across the box.  Even with fan mixing, chambers experience inhomogenietes due to radiation and thermal convection. Also, how large in dimensions is the environmental test chamber window? This matters as it needs to be large enough for RF telemetry wavelengths need to make it out."

R.11. There will be no need to have ?air inhomogeneity to better than 0.03 degrees? to verify temperature measurement accuracy of 0.3 degrees C.  The Government will use sensor proximity to verify temperature accuracy.  The size of the environmental test chamber window is 22 x 22 inches.


No Q11 in list of questions.


Q12: "Would we be unresponsive if we could not meet the sonde temperature measurement accuracy spec?"

R.12. The Government expects the requirements of the RFP to be met.
 
Q13: "Why is the temperature resolution so high (0.1)? "

R.13. A smaller than desired resolution in any of the measured parameters will increase the data rate requirements of the communication links.
 
Q14: "Would we be unresponsive if we could not meet this resolution spec but got near it, and the sonde was light/cheap?"

R.14. The Government expects the requirements of the RFP to be met.
 
Q15: "From a end user perspective, why is the barometric spec so tight (0.1 hPa)? This spec is very difficult to meet in a lightweight design using MEMS technology. What is driving this tight spec?"

R.15. Pressure is a key parameter in characterizing hurricanes and the Government wants to be able to accurately characterize the pressure field in the vicinity of hurricanes.
 

Q16: "Similar to Q14, would we be unresponsive if we could not meet the pressure specification but got near it, and the sonde was light/cheap?  We can provide pressure via GPS attitude, but we do realize that unlike a radiosonde, GPS pressure is not valid in a hurricane. But we feel the combination of a MEMS sensor and GPS altitude might get us to an 'accurate enough' pressure measurement at low weight/cost."

R.16. The Government expects the requirements of the RFP to be met.
 
Q17: "All of these last questions can be summed up as if we do not meet any one of the measurement resolution or accuracy specs, will we still get paid under the contract? Is this best effort contract or are those hard targets that we must meet in order to fulfill the contract? "

R.17. The Government expects the requirements of the RFP to be met.
 
Q18: "Is 800-1000 MHZ band range acceptable for the ODRP-to-ground station UHF telemetry? Are their FCC and international guidelines that we must accommodate?

R.18. The design of the ODRP-to-Ground Station communications link is the responsibility of the proposer and the Government cannot provide advice during the proposal stage of the procurement.  The Government will acquire experimental frequency authorizations for the testing phase.  If the proposal only has Non-Government frequency bands listed, the Government will be unable to award this contract to that proposer.
  
Q19: "If the government uses the UHF data ODRP-to-ground data link (rather than satcom), will the ground station operator be able to manually aim the telemetry antenna in the general direction of the UAV or must we use omni directional vertical antennae? If "no", how are we to accomplish this aiming, as VHF/UHF is a line-of-sight problem and the UAV will obviously move within the field-of-view?"

R.19. The ground stations will generally be unmanned.  The design of the communication links is under the purview of the proposer and the Government can not make recommendations on specific approaches.
 
Q20: "Is digital Cyclical Redundancy Checking sufficient to protect the integrity of the dropsonde-to-ODRP telemetry data link? Would CRC technology be responsive ?"

R.20. Cyclical Redundancy Checking, as generally practiced, does not ?protect the integrity? of a communications link.  If CRC technology meets the requirements of the RFP, it will be considered responsive.


Q21: "Common commercial satcom modems have a minimum burst transmit rate of 20 seconds. This means that even if the sonde acquires 1 second data it will take a minimum of 20-25 seconds for it to arrive to the ground station for display (whereupon 1 Hz data will be displayed). Will we be non-responsive if our satcom takes 20 seconds to reach the end user's ground display?

R.21. The Government understands that there are inherent delays when data are sent through the internet.
 
Q22: "Our dropsonde ( see http://www.yesinc.com/products/data/XDR-928/index.html  ) can work at -70F, however, battery life at -70F becomes a significant issue if the dropsonde and battery is 'cold-soaked' waiting on a high altitude loitering UAV. How long do you expect the UAV to be on station and could we expect that the UAV will have provision to preheat the sonde release compartment so as to keep the batteries at a warmer temperature? Or can we build such a heater into the release mechanism?"

R.22. As previously pointed out, a release mechanism is not a deliverable under this contract.  If the dropsonde proposed requires preheating at altitude, that fact should be pointed out in the proposal.
 
Q23: "On tower drop testing, how will the government ensure that the dropsonde will not hit the 950' tower on the way down? Further, how will the tower not interfere with the weak GPS signals the dropsonde needs to get a lock on? We have performed such testing on our dropsonde via a 165' tower and these are very challenging test issues. We would prefer a drop test via one of NOAA's aircraft, not via a 'tower drop'."

R.23. If, during the tower drop test, the dropsonde strikes any part of the tower, that test will be repeated.  Prior to the test, the GPS satellite constellation will be analyzed to determine which side of the tower has the most satellites in view.  A test GPS receiver will be used to verify that proper operation is possible on that side of the tower.

 Q24: "Several requirements are made about minimum acceptable dropped telemetry packets. However, it is not clear how this will actually be simulated and tested.  How will this be verified? Can the government assert that this is a 'best effort' issue, (i.e. bit error rate specifications need not apply)? The technical issue is that the RF environment is a severe challenge aboard almost any aircraft, especially an undefined one, and meeting that dropepd telemetry spec might be impossible unless we understand the target UAV quite intimately."

R.24. The Government expects that during the training, the capability to detect bad telemetry packets will be shown to the training attendees by the contractor.  How this capability is realized is the contractor?s responsibility.
 
Q25: "For many practical and cost-driven reasons, for our dropsonde-to-ODRP link we are planning on using 403-405.9 MHZ telemetry, not 1.6Ghz (as on NOAA's RRS). This is because of the inherent difficulty with operating near GPS and Iridium frequencies nearby. Would we be unresponsive to use this 403-406 MHZ band? If "yes," where do you suggest we move our telemetry band to, and then, how will we achieve license authorization operating in international waters?"

R.25. The selection of frequency bands is the responsibility of the proposer and any suggestions by the Government would be inappropriate until after a contract is in place.

<SUBJECT>A--Request for Information modeling and simulation support and analyses for Unmanned Aircraft Systems to operate in the National Airspace
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-09-08-2006
<RESPDATE>101006
<ARCHDATE>10092006
<CONTACT>james boys, (937) 255-3062
<DESC>Request for Information For Modeling and simulation support and analyses for Unmanned Aircraft Systems  to operate in the National Airspace 1.  The Air Force must operate Unmanned Air Vehicles throughout the  National Air Space (NAS) in a manner similar to manned aircraft by filing  a flight plan and operating normally in the NAS.  Currently, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) only allows unmanned aircraft to operate  within the NAS by segregating manned and unmanned aircraft, using  Certificates of Authorization (COAs) or Temporary Flight Restrictions  (TFRs).  The NAS is managed by the FAA, through a series of flight rules  and an active air traffic control system (ATC), with the objective of  keeping operating aircraft from colliding with one another to the maximum  extent possible.  Since no solution can be all-encompassing, there will  always be situations where the rules and ATC processes fail.  Therefore,  the FAA also requires manned aircraft operators to maintain vigilance to  “see and avoid” (SAA) other aircraft when operating in the NAS.  This SAA  requirement is, in essence, an additional layer of safety added to the  primary means of maintaining aircraft separation.  Since unmanned aircraft  do not have a pilot on-board the aircraft, they cannot literally comply  with the “see and avoid” requirement.  Thus, the removal of the pilot is  viewed as a reduction in aviation safety.  In order to operate Unmanned  Aircraft Systems (UAS) normally in the NAS, a means to restore it to an  equivalent level of safety (ELOS) to that of a similar class of manned  aircraft is required.  The FAA has stated that any approach taken “do no  harm” to the existing routine and safety of the current NAS.  That is, no  extraordinary or revolutionary changes in the way the current NAS is  operating would be acceptable.  Minor evolutionary changes would be  considered point by point, as required. 2.  Safety of operations is the primary concern when remotely or  autonomously operated aircraft are allowed to mix with conventionally  controlled flights in the NAS.  There is currently no experience base on  UASs that the FAA can use to issue rules and guidance.  Given that there  are currently no performance standards for SAA systems and no approval  criteria for autonomous collision avoidance systems, it is unclear how to  proceed in giving unmanned systems an "equivalent level of safety" to  manned aircraft.  The Air Force therefore intends to derive initial  capability requirements for SAA system performance (sensor performance,  communications performance, and control) through modeling, simulation, and  analysis of representative UASs. 3.  The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit  information regarding the development and simulation of an environment  that would permit modeling the “knowns” (generic aircraft including  communications, command and control performance for each class, flight  rules, ATC rules, etc.) and providing “parameter space” for the unknowns.  The goal of this modeling effort is the establishment of a performance  specification investigative tool to permit the iterative optimization of  an SAA system that enables safe UAS operations in the NAS under a given  set of operating constraints. 4.  Respondents should limit their responses to the above request to 10  pages, double spaced, single sided paper.  Due to the Federal holiday,  White Papers are due 10 OCT 2006 (as opposed to 9 OCT 2006) and should be  submitted directly to the technical point of contact Maj Luke Cropsey,  303d AESG/XR (937-255-9969), Bldg 557, Rm 213, 2640 Loop Road West,  Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433. The alternate technical point of contact  is Mr. Anthony Salmonson (937-255 4558). Contractual point of contact is  Mr. James Boys, 303d AESG/PK , (937-255-3062). This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e)  to obtain information about pricing, delivery, and other market  information or capabilities for planning purposes.  This RFI is not a  request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are  not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a  binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the  information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as  provided in FAR 31.205-18, “Bid and Proposal Costs.”  The Air Force is not  required to provide feedback to white paper submittals.

f. 	Number of aircraft that can be handled simultaneously (traffic capacity).
g. 	Environmental operating and stowage data (temperature, humidity, wind loading, and small particle intrusion protection)
h. 	Set-up and take-down times.
i. 	Deployment configurations.
j. 	List of current users that have obtained FAA certification as an enroute, terminal, and non-precision approach TACAN system.
k. 	Production lead time.
l. 	Established logistics support.
	
Submission of Information: Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) and delivered via email to the following addresses: bart.ludlow@navy.mil and helen.wright@navy.mil. Respondents submit information at their own risk.  Authors are encouraged to use appropriate graphics to enhance and clarify the information being submitted. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this request.

The United States will use this information in rea ching a decision on the method by which it will procure the needed facilities.  The following is a general description of the required facilities: LIVING QUARTERS:  Multiple structures, total of approximately 225,000 SF, 160 SF/2-person rooms, one or two story structures.  SHOWERS AND RESTROOMS:  Multiple structures, total of approximately 22,000 SF, each unit approximately 1700 SF with showers, sink s, toilets and urinals.

<CLASSCOD>X
<OFFADD>NASA/John F. Kennedy Space Center, Procurement, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899
<SUBJECT>X--REQUEST FOR INTEREST BY PROSPECTIVE TENANTS OF EXPLORATION PARK
<DESC>NASA is seeking information and formal expressions of interest from industry, academia, and other prospective tenants of Exploration Park at Kennedy Space Center.  This request is associated with NASA’s Request for Proposals (RFP) EUL-01-2006 issued September 1, 2006 seeking offers for a Master Developer of Exploration Park. That RFP is available at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=121153. EUL-01-2006 seeks offers from qualified firms interested in leading the development and long-term operation of Exploration Park, which NASA has established to enable and grow private sector participation in space exploration, support commercial space transportation and promote commercial development of technologies for application in space and on earth. NASA plans to negotiate a 50-year lease and development agreement, which could extend for up to 99 years, with the selected master developer.  NASA anticipates making a selection of a Master Developer in early 2007.  Contingent upon successfully completing the selection and negotiation of an Enhanced Use Lease and Development Agreement with a Master Developer, NASA anticipates availability of improved sites in Exploration Park as early as mid 2009. Tenants of Exploration Park will enter into commercial subleases of improved parcels, or for space in multi-tenant facilities or facilities built to tenant specifications by the Master Developer, with the Master Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of the negotiated agreement between the Master Developer and NASA. NASA does not plan to lease or otherwise furnish facilities constructed in Exploration Park to its contractors as Government Furnished Property.  NASA and international partner contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers/vendors; commercial firms associated with non-NASA operations at Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station; applied technology, engineering, and research organizations; and other potential tenants of Exploration Park which are approved by NASA, will negotiate for sites, space, and related services directly with the selected Master Developer in a manner similar to any other commercial environment on non-federal land. Commercial entities and other non-NASA organizations which envision a need and benefit from locating in Exploration Park, are consistent with the guidelines NASA has published in this RFI, and which are acceptable for tenancy in Exploration Park, will be forwarded to the Master Developer candidates (short list) to support development of the park’s initial construction phase. Interested firms and organizations are asked to respond in writing to this request for tenant expressions of interest by completing and submitting the information in the form published with this RFI, which is also available electronically on the tenant page of the Exploration Park website: &lt;http://www-ss.ksc.nasa.gov/exploration%20park/default.html&gt; Only those responses received by NASA by November 9, 2006, and which include the prospect’s written approval to disclose to the Master Developer candidates, will be assured consideration for inclusion in NASA-furnished inputs to the development of initial phase building program concepts. NASA Approval Right, Tenant Eligibility Guidelines & Prohibited Uses Because of national security, site safety, and other potential factors difficult to comprehensively anticipate, NASA requires the right to approve tenants and uses in Exploration Park.   There are some types of uses which are not deemed to be acceptable for Exploration Park.  NASA does not intend to allow: •	Highly-hazardous activities or materials •	Heavy industrial manufacturing •	Warehousing as stand-alone use •	Hotels or other major tourist facilities •	Political, social, or religious-affiliated organizations NASA proposes the following tenant criteria be used as guidelines in determining the appropriateness of prospective uses and tenants.  The proposed tenant eligibility guidelines are: 	Activities with a requirement or demonstrated benefit for close proximity to KSC/CCAFS facilities or personnel, related to the NASA	mission, or those related to space commerce and commercialization; 	Activities related to research and technology development or demonstration with known or potential application to activities in space or improvement of life on earth, including energy-related or environmental activities; 	Activities of an academic/educational nature with current or potential partnership with NASA/CCAFS; 	Activities offering support services that may reasonably be required by park tenants or resident government or contractor organizations of KSC/CCAFS, e.g. technical support, business services, and incidental, limited retail support services as deemed appropriate to support the needs of park tenants.  Retail sales should not significantly compete with merchandise sales of the KSC Visitor Complex. Conceptual Identification of Types of Tenants, and Example Projects NASA has provided in EUL-01-2006 the following conceptual thoughts about potential specific projects, based in part on previously expressed tenant interest or current market indications, to suggest some possibilities for initial project content.  Objectives and vision for synergy with NASA’s future exploration missions, and an expanded role for the private sector in space activities, may suggest any number of additional mixed use projects. •	Exploration Park Office Complex – A multi-tenant office building located near the Park’s primary access point to satisfy initial and near term demand for administrative offices, educational uses, and other similar functions. •	Technology Development and Applications Complex – A multi-tenant flex-space building, or buildings, to provide accommodations for technical support operations, technology development, technical or engineering services, light manufacturing, testing, processing and other compatible uses •	Space Center Medical and Wellness Facility – A hospital-affiliated medical services and wellness facility complex to offer convenient services for the KSC workforce, tenants of Exploration Park, visitors, and the broader local community. •	Alternative Fuels Consumer Service Station – An automotive fueling station offering conventional and alternative fuel choices for the KSC vehicle fleet, the broader KSC community, and public visitors to the nearby KSC Visitor Complex.  KSC currently has 1,756 General Services Administration (GSA) vehicles.  Of these, 935 use unleaded gas and 821 use alternative fuels (136 use Compressed Natural Gas, 140 use Bio-diesel – B20, and 545 are Flex Fuel Vehicles that use E-85). •	Academic Facility – A stand alone project, or combined with a multi-tenant facility, to cluster educational functions and academic research or applied technology development.  NASA and its contractors, and presumably the future tenants of Exploration Park, have workforce education and training needs requiring specialized curriculum.  Some higher education institutions already find sites on the space center to conduct classes and other academic programs.  NASA believes an academic presence in Exploration Park is important, and that some level of demand likely exists from providers. •	Technical Services and Support Laboratories – Past expressions of interest by KSC contractors and others suggest a demand for dedicated or shared facilities that can be leased by organizations that supply technical services to both NASA and commercial customers.  These would likely represent significant square footage requirements for functions NASA periodically re-competes. NASA has communicated with prospective park tenants for several years.	Some have remained consistently interested in leasing space in the park even as NASA’s mission focus has changed.  Others have emerged more recently due to the anticipated exploration activities and increased commercial participation.  Detailed prospective tenant information will be shared with the selected Master Developer to the extent permitted by those expressions NASA has or will receive.  Tenant Prospect Information Requested To Be Submitted In Response Interested parties who intend to formally express their interest in becoming a tenant of Exploration Park through this RFI are asked to complete and submit the following minimum information: 1. Identify and briefly describe interested organization 2. Provide organization address 3. Point of Contact: (name, telephone number, email) 4. Describe the type of activity you propose to engage in as a tenant 5. Define whether you are interested in developing a site for use by others, have a site developed for your use as the primary tenant occupant (dedicated facility), or lease space in a multi-tenant facility 6. Identify your anticipated site and/or space needs: such as a dedicated parcel of ____ acres for a tenant-developed facility, a build-to-suit dedicated facility of _____ square feet, or leased space of ________ square feet in a multi tenant facility. 7. Characterize your space requirements by office, technical, manufacturing, processing, or other appropriate category 8. Identify your anticipated need date for occupancy 9. Describe any special requirements for utilities or services 10. Identify the number and type of employees anticipated for this activity 11. Indicate whether NASA may forward this data to the short-listed Master Developer offerors for their initial phase planning 12. Provide any additional information you deem appropriate to assist NASA and the Master Developer offerors understand your interest and requirements The written response may be submitted by mail to: James E. Ball Spaceport Development Manager Mail Code TA-E Kennedy Space Center, FL  32899 The written response may be submitted electronically as an attachment to: James.e.ball@nasa.gov Additional Information for Prospective Tenants The opportunity for tenants to lease sites and space in Exploration Park is contingent upon NASA’s successful completion of its solicitation for a Master Developer, negotiation of an Enhanced Use Lease and Development Agreement with the Master Developer, and upon the Master Developer’s successful execution of the initial phase of infrastructure and building construction required to provide serviced sites for tenant facilities.  Publication of this RFI does not assure responders that space will be available to accommodate their interest or that facilities will be available for commercial lease in Exploration Park by mid 2009. While it is NASA’s intent that Exploration Park will offer commercially-competitive, market-based lease rates and terms to prospective tenants, NASA makes no representations as to the commercial terms and conditions that the selected Master Developer will offer to tenants who enter into subleases for sites or space in Exploration Park. Response to the RFI, and acceptance of the response by NASA, does not constitute formal NASA approval of the prospective tenant or use, and more information may be required by NASA before the prospective tenant and use are determined to be acceptable to NASA for tenancy in the park. The Master Developer and tenants will have 24/7 access to Exploration Park.  NASA will manage traffic and public access to KSC for major NASA launches and events, but will work with the Master Developer to assure access to Exploration Park tenants and their employees.  Park employee badges, entry via State Road 3, or other access assurance methods may be involved. In the event of extraordinary and unpredictable circumstances that could arise from hostile acts, warfare, major accidents, or natural disaster, Exploration Park access by the Master Developer, tenants, and their employees will be no less than NASA-badged KSC administrative employees. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude prospective tenants from being proposed in responses by Master Developer offerors to NASA, or by subsequent discussions with either NASA or the Master Developer as design and construction of the initial phase of Exploration Park proceeds.

Those offerors with concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical (including a statement of work) and cost proposal. An invitation based upon a submitted concept paper does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract.
(9)	In providing the rough estimate of the cost for the contract, do not include anticipated Battlelab funding of any third parties.  In a typical Battlelab contract, the submitter prepares a prototype, provides limited training for Air Force operators, provides input for demonstration planning, provides technical support during any testing and the demonstration, and writes a final report.  However, every Battlelab initiative is different, and your estimate should consider the unique aspects of your concept and technology.  
(10)	The concept paper shall be formatted as follows:   

  Section A:
  Title, Offeror, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone #, Fax #, Organization/Office
  Symbol, Address, Period of Performance, Cost of Effort. 

  Section B: 
IW Concept--What is the innovative technology, process, or procedure you are proposing?  What will your solution do?  And how will it do it?  In addition, offeror shall explicitly identify those aspects of the proposed technology, process, or procedure, which the submitter considers to be proprietary information.  

  Section C: 
 Operational Demonstration--How do you envision execution of the operational demonstration?  What is the proposed demonstration methodology?

  Section D: 
  Operational Impact--How will the product of the demonstration enhance Air Force IO operations?

  Section E: 
  Support Components--What additional things are required for the demonstration including hardware, software, data, facilities, and training?

  Section F: 
  Expected Results/Product of the demonstration--What will be the final product of the demonstration; e.g., a paper report, "bread/brass board" product, a unit ready for fielding, etc.?  Here, we want to determine the maturity of your solution, especially if it?s a material solution, to help assess the appropriate transition activities.

  Section G: 
  Proposed Users--Which members of the AF and DoD operational community will benefit from this concept?

  Section H: 
  Please note related contracts to include the point of contact's current telephone # and address.

  Section I: 
Include the following statement:  "I consent to the release of proprietary, confidential, or privileged commercial or financial data related to this concept paper to MITRE Corporation, Concurrent Technologies Corp., bdSystems Inc., Scitor Corp., and the AFIOB security officer in support of the Battlelab review and analysis process."

This announcement is effective 19 Apr 06 through 30 Sep 06 and may be renewed annually. Concept papers may be submitted at any time during this period. A copy of this BAA will be posted on the World Wide Web at www.fbo.gov with a link available at the AFIOB website, http://afiwcweb.lackland.af.mil/battlelab/.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic.
       
B.  OBJECTIVE:

(1)  Technical Description: The AFIOB is an organization focused on introducing innovations in information operations to the operational Air Force.  The AFIOB accomplishes this mission by conducting operational assessments and demonstrations of innovative information operations (IO) concepts and evaluating their military worth.  Potential IO concepts include network warfare operations, electronic warfare operations, influence operations, and supporting/enabling technologies such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), information assurance (IA), system and network management, and information dissemination management.
(2) This BAA solicits Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) related concept papers with the potential to enhance Air Force and DoD IO.  Such concepts might include IPv6 capable tools and systems used for network defense or information assurance.  However, any concept involving IPv6 networks and any IO activity or topic, are of interest to the Air Force and will be considered for funding.
(3)  Security Requirements: The submittal process under this BAA is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage the latest technology advances.  However, every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material.  Such material should not be transmitted across open-source media like public phone, fax, Internet, or e-mail.  If a submitter has any reason to believe their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, the submitter should immediately contact the Battlelab at (210) 977-3030.  In general, potentially sensitive submissions should be sent via REGISTERED MAIL to the mailing address listed in Section A of this BAA, or via e-mail to the one or both of the following secure e-mail addresses depending on the classification of the sensitive information: 

         SIPRNet: IOInnovation@iwcmx1.afiwc.aia.kelly.af.smil.mil 
         Or 
         JWICS:     IOInnovation@iswanmail.iswan.aia.ic.gov.     

Submitters who are supported by an accredited security office may be bound by specific laws and regulations directing the proper methods for transmission of classified concepts.
(4)  Other Special Requirements:
(a)  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ONLY CONCEPT PAPERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED. 
(b)  Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132. 
(c)  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA. 

C.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1)  Offerors are requested, if they have one, to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number.     
(2)  Non-government advisors will be used in the evaluation of concept papers and proposals.  MITRE Corporation, a non-profit Massachusetts company which operates a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for the Department of Defense, will assist the Government in the evaluation of concepts and proposals.  Concurrent Technologies Corp. (CTC), bdSystems, Inc., SeiCorp, Inc. and Scitor Corporation will assist the Government in the Battlelab process.  Also, the AFIOB employs a contractor as its security officer.  Non-Disclosure Agreements have been signed by MITRE, CTC, bdSystems Inc., Scitor Corporation, SeiCorp, Inc. and the Battlelab security contractor.     
(3)  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply. 
(4)  Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact at AFIOBContracts@lackland.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.   Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this acquisition. 
 

D.  CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 
(1)  The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.     
(2)  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations. The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 52.215-1(e).     
(3)  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.     
(4)  Use of a diagram or figure to depict the essence of the proposed demonstration is strongly encouraged.     
(5)  Submitter's concept papers shall not exceed three (3) pages using Microsoft Word format.  Concept papers in excess of three pages will be returned to the offeror for resubmission in accordance with the page limits.   
(6)  Additionally, the offeror shall submit an unclassified, non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.  This single page provides information for non-proprietary Battlelab briefings and reports.
(7)  Multiple concept papers addressing different topic areas may be submitted by each offeror.  However, each concept paper must address only one concept.     
(8)  The purpose of the concept paper is to preclude effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those offerors with concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical (including a statement of work) and cost proposal.  An invitation based upon a submitted concept paper does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract.
(9)  The rough cost of the effort provided by the submitter should assume that the Government will provide system operators and analysts for the operational assessment and demonstration.  Costs identified in the white paper will typically include costs for preparing prototypes, training operators for the assessment, travel, and support for planning and executing the Government run assessment and demonstration.  Any costs identified in the white paper will be used only for internal Battlelab planning; cost data in the follow-on proposal will be used for any contract.
(10)	In providing the rough estimate of the cost for the contract, do not include anticipated Battlelab funding of any third parties.  In a typical Battlelab contract, the submitter prepares a prototype, provides limited training for Air Force operators, provides input for demonstration planning, provides technical support during any testing and the demonstration, and writes a final report.  However, every Battlelab initiative is different, and your estimate should consider the unique aspects of your concept and technology.  
(11)  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows:       

     Section A:
Title, Offeror, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone #, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address, Period of Performance, Cost of Effort; 

     Section B: 
IO Concept--What is the innovative technology, process, or procedure you are proposing?  What will your solution do?  And how will it do it?  In addition, offeror shall explicitly identify those aspects of the proposed technology, process, or procedure, which the submitter considers to be proprietary information.     

     Section C: 
Operational Assessment and Demonstration--How would you envision operationally assessing and demonstrating the concept?  What are the suggested methodologies?  Be aware that the Battlelab retains the right to assess and demonstrate the concept in whatever manner is most advantageous to the Air Force and DoD.

     Section D: 
Operational Impact--How would your proposed concept, if realized, enhance or support Air Force and DoD information operations?

     Section E: 
Support Components--What additional resources, besides funds and manpower, are required for the assessment and demonstration you suggest?  Identify such items as hardware, software, data, facilities, and specialized training.

     Section F: 
Expected Results/Product of the demonstration--What will be the final product of the assessment and demonstration; e.g. a paper report, "bread/brass board" product, a unit ready for fielding, etc.?  Here, we want to determine the maturity of your solution, especially if it?s a material solution, to help assess the appropriate transition activities. 

     Section G: 
Proposed Users--Which members of the AF and DoD community will benefit from this concept?  Are there other potential U.S. Government or allied users?  If so, identify them.

     Section H: 
Please identify your related contracts to include the point of contact's current telephone # and address.

     Section I: 
Include the following statement:  "I consent to the release of proprietary, confidential, or privileged commercial or financial data related to this concept paper to MITRE Corporation, Concurrent Technologies Corp., bdSystems Inc., Scitor Corp., SeiCorp, Inc. and the AFIOB security officer in support of the Battlelab review and analysis process."

No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 2 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements for IVENT 201 VENTILATORS. Information may be faxed to the Contracting Office at 440.838.6052. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with. TRI-ANIM HEALTH SERVICES

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Office of the Secretary, Executive Secretariat, Office of Information Resource Management (S/ES-IRM).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP storage devices.   S/ES-IRM has identified HP storage devices as a key component of our information technology base.  S/ES-IRM provides information technology services and support for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat and the principal officers of the Department.   We need to use hard drives with proven results.  HP has a long term record of reliability which is supported by all industry reviews.  This request is actually an upgrade of the drives on our existing HP Storage Area Network.  We need HP drives to maintain our warranty and support agreements.   Our hardware technicians are HP certified and are experts at the repair and maintenance of the HP storage units.  They have taken the SAN support/maintenance training and are cleared to work on the HP SAN know as Enterprise Virtual Array or EVA.  Sunk costs make it too expensive to change vendors.  It would require almost one million dollars to change the SAN equipment to accommodate another vendor’s drives so a significant expense to the government.      As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office.   The HP Storage Area Network has undergone test, assessment and evaluation and received final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board.

S/ES-IRM has identified the Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) terminals as a key upgrade component for our traveling satellite communications information technology base for the Secretary of State and traveling party.  The lifecycle of the current units (M4 and GloComm) being deployed have expired.  BGAN units will replace these older terminals.  The BGANS offer increased and more reliable bandwidth.  They are also much smaller, making them easier to transport.  Furthermore, the BGAN units are compatible with our existing INMARSAT satellite support infrastructure. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office.   HP printers have undergone test, assessment and evaluation and received final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers. S/ES-IRM has identified HP printers as a key component of our information technology base.  HP has a long term record of reliability which is supported by all industry reviews.  S/ES-IRM provides information technology services and support for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat and the principal officers of the Department.   We need to use printers with proven results.  Other printers we have introduced to the network have had less successful results. Our hardware technicians are HP certified and are experts at the repair and maintenance of the HP printers.  There would be an additional expense to the government to maintain multiple brands of printers.  We have standardized on a few HP models reducing the cost of maintaining our inventory of maintenance kits and toner.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS) is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Domestic Technical Service Branch.  The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of firewall equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governemnt's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI/DTS is working in conjunction with IRM/OPS/MSO/EML to build a new firewall cluster. The new cluster must be compatible with IRM/OPS/MSO/EML's preexisting systmes in order for it to work properly.  Firewalls of another brand will cuase a disruption in daily operations and put the integrity of the current secure systems at risk.  Stone Gate Firewalls are a major component of the Department of State email and INternet infrastructure.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualification are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component fo the Department's firewall networking infrastructure.  Based on the above requirements, the Stone Gate Firewalls are required for the continued protection of the external perimeter of the Department of State Internet presence.  Because of the sensitive nature of the mission critical operating environment, any deviations form the pre-existing firewall infrastructure would render it vulnerable to otential viruses, harmful attacks and interrupt the availability of the network to State employees.  THe goal of the Department is to maintain a cohesive firewall infrastructure with maximum protection and utilization.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Brocade 48000 32 port switch, together with the requisitioned Quantum DX30 tape library and PX510 tape library, will create a backup solution that will meet the needs of CA/CST/DO.  The equipment will allow for nightly mailbox level backups and multiple Exchange backups during the day, minimizing the risk of lost mail.  The solutions will also allow for faster restores as writing from disk has been tested to be five to ten times faster than from tape.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Brocade 48000 32 port switch for its Quantum DX30 and PX510 Tape Library.  Currently, CA’s backups are managed using a combination of Netbackup 4.0 and the Quantum P 3000.  The P3000 has reached the end of its supported life and is beginning to experience failures that jeopardize the ability to adequately backup and restore mission critical data.  In addition, the SDLT tape technology of the former backup system is now becoming obsolete.  The new solution with combine disk and tape based technologies to provide a faster backup and recovery, site redundancy, scalability and lower operational cost.     This purchase will allow CA to implement a new backup solution to replace the current failing one while still allowing CA to still utilize the existing tapes.  CA/CST has selected the Brocade switch because results obtain by the Bureau’s Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this tape library most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.

D) Full  HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal configurations to meet CA/CST/TI’s IV&V projects needs.  These servers will be used for production readiness and performance testing of CA software systems using high-end performance testing software provided through IBM-Rational.  Therefore, the specs presented herein as recommended by IBM-Rational, must be met or exceeded in order to support the 10,000-user test bed in stress and load testing scenarios.  Failure to met or exceed the specifications would limit software testing, which could lead to failure of fielded CA software during periods of international crisis.  The HP DL380 G5 servers meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 servers have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC Symmetrix DMX801 and EMC Brocade DS4100B-24 24-Port Switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration. This need is based on IV&V's task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment. There are tools that this configuration (the DMX802 and 24-Port Brocade Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX3000 in production but in a very small and cost effective package. The DMX801 provides the same functionality including command line interface. Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The EMC SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications.  This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution.  The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data). The EMC Symmetrix DMX801 and EMC Brocade DS4100B-24 24-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

TO BE HAVE BID CONSIDERED, SELLERS MUST BE CISCO GOLD, SILVER AND PREMIER PARTNERS. NO EXCEPTIONS. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco switch and 1000Base. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Catalyst 6506e switch is an enterprise-class, stackable, multi-layer switch that provides high availability, security and quality of service. It offers Layer 3 granular quality of service features to classify and prioritize network traffic, and to avoid network congestion, can classify, reclassify, police, and mark the incoming packets before the packet is placed in the shared buffer. Packet classification allows the network elements to discriminate between various traffic flows and enforce policies based on Layer 2 and Layer 3 quality of service fields. The 6506e switch is capable of performing rate limiting with Cisco Committed Information Rate (CIR) functionality and offers enhanced data security through a wide range of security features that protect network management and administrative traffic. The Catalyst 6506e switch meets the following requirements: • The switch must provide Layer 3 routing services. • The switch must have HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) functionality. • The switch must perform at wire speed. • The switch must be able to be configured in active standby mode with high availability. • The switch must provide a committed access rate, limiting transmission rates based on flexible criteria. • The switch must have quality of service functionality The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Problems within EIS’s LAN started around 05/30/2006. Two of EIS’s three switches died, a Cisco 3550 and 2950. Both switches were approximately 3 years old. A 3COM 10MB Hub and Cisco FatHub 400 Hub are currently being used until a replacement can be procured; both of these hubs are over 4 years old. EIS’s core 4600 switch is also over 4 years old, is no longer supported by Cisco, is out of ports, and has been experiencing periodic hardware failures. The overall effect is that EIS end users are experiencing unacceptable latency, are periodically unable to logon to OpenNet and access applications such as e-mail and Remedy, and unable to perform their programming tasks such as TCM software upgrades. It is DO’s recommendation to replace all three switches with a single Cisco 6506E switch and 1000Base which will be co-managed onsite by EIS staff and Domestic Operations engineering personnel.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal configurations to meet CA/CST/PD’s IVAMS Web Database needs.  Currently, software integration testing between systems utilizing the CCD must be accomplished using ‘workarounds’ during systems development and Quality Assurance (QA) Testing.  As a result, end-to-end integration testing is not performed until IV & V testing commences.  These servers will allow software developers and testers to perform integration testing prior to the IV&V testing phase of the software development cycle.  More and more functional systems processing is being facilitated by databse replication and processing services inside the CCS.  Through the purchase of this equipment, access to an ‘integrated’ development and testing environment will result in reduced development time resulting in fewer errors.  Reduced development time translates to significant cost savings.   The HP DL380 G5 servers meet the project requirements above and beyond other tested server options.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 servers have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via HP authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full  HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Quantum DX30 tape library and PX510 tape library will together create a backup solution that will meet the needs of CA/CST/DO.  The equipment will allow for nightly mailbox level backups and multiple Exchange backups during the day, minimizing the risk of lost mail.  The solutions will also allow for faster restores as writing from disk has been tested to be five to ten times faster than from tape.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST requires the Quantum DX30 and PX510 Tape Library.  Currently, CA’s backups are managed using a combination of Netbackup 4.0 and the Quantum P 3000.  The P3000 has reached the end of its supported life and is beginning to experience failures that jeopardize the ability to adequately backup and restore mission critical data.  In addition, the SDLT tape technology of the former backup system is now becoming obsolete.  The new solution with combine disk and tape based technologies to provide a faster backup and recovery, site redundancy, scalability and lower operational cost.     This purchase will allow CA to implement a new backup solution to replace the current failing one while still allowing CA to still utilize the existing tapes.  CA/CST has selected the Quantum DX30 and PX510 Backup Solution because results obtain by the Bureau’s Domestic Operations Infrastructure Support Services team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this tape library most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum DX30 and PX510 Backup Solution without delay.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: RM/DCFO/GFMS requires an expansion to its existing development environment in Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased amount of development required to support the implementation of GFMS.  All of this equipment and software would be housed in the SDM development network and integrated with the existing development labs in Charleston and SA15.  RM/DCFO/GFMS/SDM must support Charleston and Washington based development activities in a consolidated network. As a result, each layer of the network’s technical architecture has been designed with high availability and redundancy in mind. Identical workstations, software, software development tools, printers, switches and monitors are fully configured to be utilized and to backup other similar equipment in the event of hardware failure. Likewise, each layer of the architecture must work seamlessly with itself. This means that a network equipment component layer must be not only compatible, but have the same performance, and operations characteristics so as not to introduce performance anomalies.  Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in HP printer technology. HP printers are used by State and USAID for the current production operations throughout SA15 and the Charleston Financial Center. CISCO switches are deployed throughout the Department’s network. Charleston has standardized its multi-hundred workstations on the Think Centre model. Microsoft desktop software is the Departmental standard. TOAD is the tool currently in use by SDM developers when developing systems using the Oracle database. WISE installation software is used for all current post level deployment packages by SDM. Charleston data center racks currently have 8 port HP switches and need to be expanded to their compatible 16 port configuration. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The RM bureau also has an extensive installed base of development software, workstations, switches and printers. Previous bulk orders for parts, cables, and toner cartridges for this equipment allow SDM to leverage there existing equipment inventory in an efficient manner. In addition, common maintenance can be performed by network technicians. To introduce additional supply inventories would defeat the savings achieved through these bulk orders. HP printers, CISCO switches, Microsoft and TOAD development software, Think Centre workstations and Samsung monitors are available on a number of GSA schedules.  Based on the current production installed base of this equipment and software and the critical need for the GFMS to stay consistent with their network configurations, RM recommends the acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of this software and equipment for our development network.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

1. CONTRACTING DIVISION: 366 CONS/LGCB. 26 September, 2006.

2. NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Brand Name Justification and Approval for a Purchase Order Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES: Equipment and installation of a Pelco Pan/Tilt/Zoom camera at the Grand View Gate.  Equipment to be purchased is; 1ea. Pelco Dome Spectra III C to BW (part # SD53CBW-HPE1), 1ea. Pelco Outdoor Housing (part # DD53CBW), 1ea. Pelco Power Supply (part # WCS1-4), 1ea. Pelco Pendant Mount (part #IWM-WT), and 2ea. IFS Single Mode Fiber Modems W/ Data (part # VT/R 1530 WDM).

4. AUTHORITY:  FAR 11.105 Brand Name and FAR 13.106(b), Pelco is the established Security Camera Control System on Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB. Contract # F10603-03-A071A is a maintenance contract with Integrated Security Systems (ISS), for the existing 7 cameras currently supporting the security system on MHAFB.  The subject acquisition will integrate into the existing multiplexer, keyboard, and DVR warranted and maintained under the aforementioned contract until 2007. There is no other high resolution camera that would be 100% compatible to the existing system and uphold the manufactures warranty. If any foreign product, other than Pelco integrates into the existing system, Pelco?s  manufacturers warranty will void all of the existing parts under the current contract. That action would void $174,902.37 of the Governments dollars and would not be cost effective. 

5. APPLICATION OF AUTHORITY:  The Security Forces currently has security cameras installed in strategic locations throughout the installation, which are all controlled by a multiplexer located at the Security Forces Control Center in Building 1013.  These cameras are a critical part of the installation?s Integrated Base Defense Operations and are vital to the security of the installation?s resources and personnel.  If these cameras become inoperative it would create a major security deficiency and would degrade the installation?s overall security.  An incompatible camera system would greatly affect the frequency of the hardware and software anomalies to this multiplexer, intern degrading the security of this installation. 

6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FAIR COMPETITION:  Technical experts in the Communications Squadron, and reliable security companies and have verified that a different camera would conflict and not have 100% integrate with the current Pelco cameras or controllers.  

7. FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: Price fair and reasonable will be based on market research and competitive quotes IAW FAR Part 13.106-3.

8. MARKET SURVEY:   All practicable measures were taken to research the availability of additional vendors and manufacturers that can satisfy this requirement.  The government will continue to search for vendors that manufacture and install the necessary line retiming module.

9. OTHER FACTS: Currently, Security Forces Squadron and Fighter Wing are working together to purse a requirements contract to cover all maintenance of our security systems base wide. This Pelco camera system will fall under the new warranty/maintenance of this upcoming contract.   The Communications Squadron has reduced its manning, therefore the communication technicians will no longer be available to provide maintenance of MHAFB?s security systems, to include these existing and new cameras.  Therefore this warranty is even more prudent than ever to uphold, as there would be no military member with the expertise to repair the equipment.

10 . STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: We will continue to search for competitive companies that provide equipment compatible with our telephone switch.

11. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:  I certify the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete.

                                                                ____________________________________
					     Shawn P. Roddin, GS-09, USAF 
				                 Resource Protection Manager

12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION: The contracting officer?s signature below represents a certification the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer?s knowledge and belief.

                                                                 _____________________________________

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT:
1.0	**OVERVIEW: ** This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the tasks required to develop and certify a modernized replacement for the current AC system for the HU-25 fleet of aircraft. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has in service three types of HU-25 aircraft, they are the HU-25 A, C and D.  The primary Alternating Current power source for these aircraft is the 20 KVA AC generator.  The hydraulically driven 20 KVA generator provides 115 VAC; three phase 400 cycles to the main AC bus.  The current electrical system (for mission avionics) experiences numerous failures, low Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), requires extensive maintenance, and includes components that are obsolete and unserviceable.  The Constant Speed Drive (CSD) system components have become some of the most significant mission readiness degraders on the airframe.  Failures of the Constant Speed Motor (CSM) and AC generator are expensive and result in the HU-25 being out of commission while the units are located and replaced.  A modern AC power Generation system will enhance HU-25 mission readiness and reduce life cycle costs. The CSD system consists of three primary components: The two engine driven hydraulic pumps, the constant speed drive Motor (CSM) and the main AC generator.  The CSM, AC generator, hydraulic plumbing, and wiring are located in the aft compartment of the aircraft.  The total weight of the system located in the aft compartment is approximately 150 lbs, this estimate takes in consideration all equipment, wiring, hydraulic tubing and fluids.  The current center of gravity of the aircraft is critical and reduction in weight of the system is desirable.

2.0	  **SCOPE: ** The USCG is seeking a System to replace the current CSD system which generates alternating current (AC) electrical power on its fleet of HU-25 aircraft.  A “Commercial-Off-The Shelf” (COTS) System is desired.  The prospective contractor shall be a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center having the engineering, analysis, development certifications, and integration expertise to provide the services required.  The design shall specify all industry recognized standards for equipment and hardware which will be incorporated into each aircraft to generate clean, safe MIL-STD-704F AC electrical power.  The USCG estimates that 12KVA, 400 cycles, three-phases is the minimum power requirement.  The prospective contractor shall perform a baseline load analysis to confirm the USCG’s 12 KVA, 400 cycle, three-phase loads requirement.  The quote shall include a complete description of the proposed system, associated drawings, schematics, and manuals required for installation and maintenance.  Quotes must specify MTBF of the equipment. Copies of relevant documentation shall accompany the System package. Award will be based on a solid technical quote, past performance, and Firm Fixed Price.

The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the USCG merits a higher price on Technical Superiority and Past Performance. The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the quotations relative capability as measured against the following evaluation factors: Factor 1 –Technical, Factor 2 – Past Performance and Factor 3 – Cost/Price. Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While Factor 3-Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price factors (1 and 2) are significantly more important than the price factor. However, as technical quote become substantially equal, price may be the determining factor in selecting a quote for award. Any conversations with present or former customers will be documented. FACTOR 1-The prospective contractor shall provide the following Technical data: 1.) detailed work scope showing technical understanding of the requirements for a safe and reliable system; 2.) Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) documentation; 3.) Supportability of the proposed equipment and ease of installation; 4.) Whether the system is a COTS replacement; 5.)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-851); 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606; Washington, D. C. 20593; Telephone (202) 267-2285; Fax: (202) 267-4011

This program brings individuals from around the world to the USPTO for training on intellectual property rights.  Participants include judges, prosecutors, patent, trademark and copyright officials, and foreign policy makers.  This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-12 and constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  NAICS Code 721110.

The Government will award one or more BPAs.  The period of performance is January 1, 2007-December 31, 2012.  The USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase the existing BPA to fulfill the USPTO's requirements.  To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the offeror must propose a facility that is compliant with the requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et. seq.) and is listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/applications/hotel/ and must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration website (www.ccr.gov).

The hotel must be in Alexandria, VA and in close proximity to the USPTO campus (600 Dulany Street; Alexandria, VA  22313).  Hotel must accept Government Purchase Orders.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Office of the Secretary, Executive Secretariat, Office of Information Resource Management (S/ES-IRM).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP storage devices.   S/ES-IRM has identified HP storage devices as a key component of our information technology base.  S/ES-IRM provides information technology services and support for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat and the principal officers of the Department.   We need to use hard drives with proven results.  HP has a long term record of reliability which is supported by all industry reviews.  This request is actually an upgrade of the drives on our existing HP Storage Area Network.  We need HP drives to maintain our warranty and support agreements.   Our hardware technicians are HP certified and are experts at the repair and maintenance of the HP storage units.  They have taken the SAN support/maintenance training and are cleared to work on the HP SAN know as Enterprise Virtual Array or EVA.  Sunk costs make it too expensive to change vendors.  It would require almost one million dollars to change the SAN equipment to accommodate another vendor’s drives so a significant expense to the government.      As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office.   The HP Storage Area Network has undergone test, assessment and evaluation and received final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board.

Brand name justification for procurement of Dell EMC DMX3 Symmetrix Storage array with 28TB usable to replace exiting DMX800's for the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Human Resources. For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1. For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. •	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms — helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  •	ImageWatch™ — Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  •	Block updates — By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.  •	Image commonality — By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  •	Component commonality — The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  •	Management commonality — Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  •	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  •	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  •	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  •	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  •	Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.  •	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library.   CA currently runs the Spectra T-950 tape library at its primary site in Beltsville.  This purchase will allow CA to form the redundant site at the Harry S Truman Building (Main State).  Because CA requires the movement of tapes between the two sites for disaster recovery purposes, the redundant site must exactly match the primary site.  For compatibility purposes, the Spectra T-950 will best meet CA’s needs.   Also, the continued use of the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950, rather than to introduce another manufacturer’s product, is cost effective.  The use of one make and model eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, and drives for multiple tape library types    In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the SpectraLogic Spectra T-950 Tape Library because results obtain by the Bureau’s Data Engineering Task Team in evaluations and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape libraries indicated that this tape library most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. amended line items.

NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) project’s needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS server environments with the new servers.  The HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) project’s needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS server environments with the new servers.  The HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. BROKE OUT TAPE AUTOLOADER AND RACK KIT FROM SERVER CONFIGURATION.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of renewals of Dell extended service plans.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/TI owns and has in use multiple Dell PowerEdges, power connectors, and EMC’s.  The current warranties on these existing Dell items are all set to expire between now and the end of October 2006.  Service plan will need to be renewed through Dell before October 2006, to ensure proper maintenance and service will continue uninterrupted.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 6850 Servers and Dell PowerEdge 2950 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 6850 Servers and Dell PowerEdge 2950 Servers as the optimal high-end platform to meet the needs of the Harry S Truman Building (Main State) redundant site.  CA is currently running Dell Servers at its primary site in Beltsville; this purchase will allow CA to create a redundant site at Main State.  In order to maintain compatibility between primary site and the redundant site, CA requires the same hardware configuration at each location. The purchase of these Dell servers will ensure compatibility and will best meet CA’s needs. The Dell PowerEdge servers w/dual core Intel Xenon processor were judged to offer the most power and redundancy of any server of its class, and was determined to be best suited to support the redundant site. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements.The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendor’s out years support and maintenance agreements. added line items 014 - 017

NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. ).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server have been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s projects needs.  The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server without delay. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the H HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL360 G5 and HP DL380 have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The servers required for the following projects must have RAID configuration utility compatible with existing systems so that no new user training is required: •	Telecom •	QA and Contingency •	iCLASS Contingency The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers meet this stipulation.

NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED. ).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server have been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s projects needs.  The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server without delay. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the H HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers have been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL360 G5 and HP DL380 have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The servers required for the following projects must have RAID configuration utility compatible with existing systems so that no new user training is required: •	Telecom •	QA and Contingency •	iCLASS Contingency The HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server and HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers meet this stipulation. amended line item 002

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: RM/DCFO/GFMS requires an expansion to its existing development environment in Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased amount of development required to support the implementation of GFMS.  All of this equipment and software would be housed in the SDM development network and integrated with the existing development labs in Charleston and SA15.  RM/DCFO/GFMS/SDM must support Charleston and Washington based development activities in a consolidated network. As a result, each layer of the network’s technical architecture has been designed with high availability and redundancy in mind. Identical workstations, software, software development tools, printers, switches and monitors are fully configured to be utilized and to backup other similar equipment in the event of hardware failure. Likewise, each layer of the architecture must work seamlessly with itself. This means that a network equipment component layer must be not only compatible, but have the same performance, and operations characteristics so as not to introduce performance anomalies.  Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in HP printer technology. HP printers are used by State and USAID for the current production operations throughout SA15 and the Charleston Financial Center. CISCO switches are deployed throughout the Department’s network. Charleston has standardized its multi-hundred workstations on the Think Centre model. Microsoft desktop software is the Departmental standard. TOAD is the tool currently in use by SDM developers when developing systems using the Oracle database. WISE installation software is used for all current post level deployment packages by SDM. Charleston data center racks currently have 8 port HP switches and need to be expanded to their compatible 16 port configuration. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The RM bureau also has an extensive installed base of development software, workstations, switches and printers. Previous bulk orders for parts, cables, and toner cartridges for this equipment allow SDM to leverage there existing equipment inventory in an efficient manner. In addition, common maintenance can be performed by network technicians. To introduce additional supply inventories would defeat the savings achieved through these bulk orders. HP printers, CISCO switches, Microsoft and TOAD development software, Think Centre workstations and Samsung monitors are available on a number of GSA schedules.  Based on the current production installed base of this equipment and software and the critical need for the GFMS to stay consistent with their network configurations, RM recommends the acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of this software and equipment for our development network.

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to potential offerors' questions.  The due date for proposals remains unchanged.

1. Where in the proposal do we put the three audited/reviewed financial statements? An Appendix to the Cost Proposal?

	Answer:  That would be fine.

2) Can we use either or both GSA schedules of the prime and our teaming
partner?  Our partner's schedule has many more labor categories than
ours.

Answer:  You would use the rates from your schedule, and your teaming partner the rates from his schedule.

3) Are the labor categories in the sample tasks subsets of the labor categories we are bidding? 

	Answer:  You can interpret this as you wish.  The sample tasks are provided to demonstrate your technical approach, not your pricing matrix.

4.  For the production support sample task, how many emails and phone calls per month? 

	Answer:  You can provide your own estimate.

5) For the production support sample task, how many maintenance requests per month?

	Answer:  You can provide your own estimate.

6.  The wording in the solicitation for CMMI certification is not accurate.  The Software Engineering Institute (governing body of CMMI) states: "It is a common misperception that the SEI certifies organizations at a certain maturity level.  The SEI does NOT certify any organization. The correct terminology, if an organization wishes to announce that it has had an appraisal, is: "X organization has been appraised at Level X of the Capability Maturity Model (i.e. for Software, Integration, etc.) by an SEI-authorized Lead Appraiser."  Further, Appraisal Classes consist of SCAMPI A, B or C.  SCAMPI CLASS A is the most rigorous method and the only method that can result in a rating.  Therefore, suggest modify the solicitation to require proof of a SCAMPI class A appraisal at CMMI level 2 by an SEI-authorized Lead Appraiser."

	Answer:

7.  To improve readability, is Arial type font acceptable within a graphic?

	Answer:  That is fine.
