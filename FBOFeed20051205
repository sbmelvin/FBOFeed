<CONTACT>Leo Christodoulou, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 703-696-2374, Fax 571-218-4553, Email none
<DESC>Topologically Controlled Lightweight Armor (TCLA), BAA06-09, Proposals Due: 4:00 PM ET, January 23, 2006.  POC:  Dr. Leo Christodoulou, DARPA/DSO; Phone (703) 696-2374; 
Fax (703) 741-1368.

The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking proposals to develop new armor material and/or system designs in a Topologically Controlled Lightweight Armor (TCLA) program.  The vision for the TCLA program is to exploit the concept of topological arrangements of multiple materials to achieve ballistic performance beyond what can be achieved through material chemical or compositional changes alone and to deliver the improved performance at a reasonable cost.  The TCLA program will take a comprehensive approach, and submissions are expected to address materials development/manufacturing, testing, and modeling.  Teaming among proposers with skills in these areas is encouraged.  The parallel goals for the TCLA program are high performance against multiple threats and low cost relative to comparable state-of-the-art armor systems.  An accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) must also be referenced to aid in the production of proposals (http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/tcla_PIP.pdf).

The focus of the TCLA program is to develop improved armor systems for military vehicles.  The unifying theme of the program is that the topology, or arrangement of the materials in the armor, is the key to the performance.  There is no requirement to include specific classes of materials, although it is anticipated that successful systems may be combinations of more than one material type.  Passive armor systems are desired; however, non-passive systems operating within the confines of the armor will be considered.  “Bullet-on-bullet” or similar techniques that use a projectile or directed energy to defeat a threat beyond the plane of the armor panel are outside the scope of this program.  Proposers to the TCLA program are expected to establish the following:  (1) A multidisciplinary armor team exploiting the concept of “topology control” to achieve blast/ballistic performance beyond what can be achieved through the use of chemical/compositional changes in armor materials alone (i.e., going beyond employing known high-end ceramics, composites, and metals); (2) The experimental efforts in TCLA will be closely coupled and complemented with a strong modeling and simulation activity.  The modeling effort can incorporate analytical and expert system ballistic modules integrated to provide a “rule and tool” set, enabling design and production of armor to defeat rapidly changing threats; (3) Establish the defeat mechanisms behind the multifunctional armor design at a sufficient detail to enable changing the design with evolving threats.

Specific metrics for Phases I and II are listed in the PIP.  The metrics for Phase I include, in part, (1) a 50% reduction in weight compared to rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) steel for specified threats; (2) acceptable performance against an artillery shell-type improvised explosive device (IED); and (3) justification of manufacturing cost projections for Phase II.  The metrics for Phase II include, in part, (1) a 67% reduction in weight compared to RHA steel for specified threats; (2) acceptable performance against artillery shell-type IEDs; and (3) projections for the final armor system that have a cost to the customer of 50% less than RHA steel.




PROGRAM PHASES 
The TCLA effort will be conducted in two phases:  a 12-month Phase I and an 18-month Phase II.  Proposers are requested to submit a proposal that addresses the technical effort in both phases.  The final product at the end of Phase II will be an armor material system design and manufacturing method that can be immediately transitioned to the Services.  

At the end of the Phase I period, the team's performance will be evaluated in two areas: 1) progress on reducing armor weight as determined by appropriate metrics detailed here and in the associated PIP, and 2) the expected cost of the armor in production quantities.  There may be a downselect of participants at the end of Phase I, depending on the technical results and availability of funding.  Phase II, for those selected to continue, will culminate in delivery of the final product, an advanced vehicle or personnel armor system.

TEAMING
The goals of the TCLA program demand that a successful proposal will involve participation by a multi-disciplinary team.  It is anticipated that teams will include capabilities in more than one of the following disciplines: materials science, including ceramics, metallurgy, composites, and/or polymers; engineering; manufacturering; ballistics; and modeling & simulation (e.g., finite element analysis, shock physics).  DARPA will coordinate all testing at the end of Phases I and II to ensure that armor performance is judged consistently by an objective organization.  However, proposers are encouraged to include resources for interim ballistic testing to aid in armor and model development efforts.  Proposers that focus in only one technology element may be asked to team with other organizations.  Since team composition will improve the chances of success of this program, a teaming website is available to facilitate these interactions (www.sainc.com/TCLA_Teaming).

EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESS 
Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in the PIP under 6.0, Proposal Format. Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for the reviewer's convenience only and not considered as part of the proposal.  DARPA reserves the right to request an oral presentation of proposals.  If such a request is made, it is expected that, to the extent possible, all key personnel on the team will be present.  The request for an oral presentation, or lack thereof, should not be construed as either a positive or negative assessment of the proposal.

The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are deemed unsatisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.

Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposal
Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk and that they have a plan for mitigation of those issues and risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding beyond the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.

Value to Defense
Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change the capability of armor for the military.  This must include a discussion of the state of the art and how this program will dramatically improve it.  A critical part of this evaluation criterion is the approach used to ensure that there is a feasible transition path from the research phase of this effort to the use of the armor systems by the military (i.e., that the armor fabrication can be cost-effective and reproducible).

Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.

Cost Realism
Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government. 

The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options. 

SECURITY
Proposers must either have a SECRET security clearance or be willing to obtain such a clearance.  Security classification guidelines for armor materials have been developed by the Army Research Laboratory Weapons and Materials Research Directorate, and these guidelines will be provided to contractors at the start of the program.  The TCLA program may include information controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130, therefore contractors may be required to protect information pursuant to ITAR and are encouraged to consider this when proposing.

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for SDB, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

The accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) contains necessary details regarding program planning and objectives as well as guidelines for proposal preparation, submission and evaluation that are not contained in this BAA (http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/tcla_PIP.pdf).  Proposals shall consist of two volumes: Technical and Cost.  PROPOSALS ARE DUE TO THE ADDRESS SHOWN BELOW NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM ET, January 23, 2006.  Proposals submitted by fax will not be accepted.

GUIDANCE FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND DATA
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.  Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award. Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA.  An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.  For instructions on submitting classified proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4841.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with TASC, Inc., for the analysis of the effects on safety and security of proposed changes to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSRs), and to DoD Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302 under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Volpe Center has sponsored this contractor in the development of a powerful and unique computer simula tion that models the FAA and DoD air traffic control SSR and IFF systems individually in detail as well as their aggregate behavior in an area of thousands of square miles.  This model, previously validated by the FAA, is the best tool for evaluating the impact of changes in civil-military secondary surveillance radar and transponder populations that are now existent and evolving upon their effectiveness and interoperable.  As aircraft populations continue to grow in the National Airspace System (NAS), this simulation is used to address challenges these systems present to FAA/DoD’s ability to operate safely.  Use of this model allows the Volpe Center to better understand the impact of proposed changes to the existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and other aviation security surveillance system s.   Interested firms must submit a written capability statement to the above named point of contact providing clear and convincing evidence of the firms’ capability to provide the required services. Written capability statements must be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered. Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender. A determination by the Gove rnment not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Telephone calls made in place of the required documentation will not be accepted.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure one (1) Pre-Production Test Program Set (TPS) for a variant of the T-700 class engine.    The TPS is a set of hardware and software used in conjunction with the Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) System to perform dynamic testing of the above mentioned General Electric (GE) engine.  The hardware consists of the Engine Adapter Assembly (EAA) used to interface the engine with the SETI.  The hardware will be designed in-house with technical data and technical support from Racal.  This procurement will include technical data, technical support, manufacture of a Pre-Production unit, development of the software, integration of the TPS with the SETI System and Integrated Logistics Support data, which includes training, publications, calibration, SERD development, supply support, LSA/LMI data and software.  The TPS is required by 1 September 2006.  The Government plans to solicit and negotiate the procurement with Racal Instruments, Inc., 4 Goodyear St., Irvine, CA 92618-2002.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this firm is considered the only supplier for this requirement, as they are the sole source designer, manufacturer, and integrator of the SETI system and associated equipment at this time.  The drawings and specifications for the SETI System are being developed by Racal under contract N68335-02-C-0005.  The drawings are not currently available to compete this effort.  However, it is the intention of the Navy that when the Drawing package is completed and verified it will be used to conduct a full and open competition for future SETI requirements.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  NAWCADLKE intends to procure under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c ) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The point of contact is:  Ms. Nancy. Delaney, phone (732) 323-4478, facsimile: (732) 323- 4822, email: Nancy.Delaney@navy.mil or Mr. Keith Davis, phone (732) 323-2243, facsimile (732) 323- 4822 or e-mail: Keith.Davis@navy.mil

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519.   This is a notice of intent, not a Request for Quotation or solicitation.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA for the renewal of Microsoft Premier Support, Account Number 64494. Microsoft Premier Support includes the following services: 1) Service elements, 2) Problem resolution support, and 3) Information services and workshops. Service elements includes: 1) up to 200 hours of service resource time, 2) SAM and SA hours, which can be used for infrastructure support assistance, reviews, development support assistance, and lab, 3) planning and resource facilitation, 4) status meetings and reporting, and 5) escalation management. The problem resolution support includes 1) fifty (50) support incidents, 2) hot fixes, 3) critical problem alerts, and 4) multi-vendor coordination. The information services and workshops include 1) newsflashes and 2) unlimited-user service desk license, which includes one (1) prepaid site visit (up to 2-days, NA only), one (1) Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription (single server), and one (1) MSDN Subscription. Microsoft Premier Support from Microsoft provides direct and quick access to internal Microsoft software developers and source codes for current and future products twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. The BOP requires such resources because system failures that are not resolved quickly could jeopardize the safe and secure operation of BOP institutions. Purchasing support from a reseller or a third party vendors do not be meet the BOPs requirements, as the BOP would not have direct access to Microsoft source code and developers, which are essential for the immediate access the BOP needs to resolve system failures that may impact the operations of our institutions. This proposed noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 13. BOP plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, ArrowPoint 2, 8050 Microsoft Way, Charlotte, NC 28273. The period of performance will be from November 27, 2005 to November 26, 2006.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: Broad Area Announcement (BAA) 06-05-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: Fiscal Year (FY) 06 should be submitted by 30 December 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07; FY 09 by 1 May 08; FY 10 by 1 May 09 and, FY 11 by 1 May 10. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support Air Force communications as it applies to Modeling and Simulation, Enterprise Management, and Networking and Communication Links for the future Airborne Network (AN). Even though the primary technology area is modeling and simulation for AN, this BAA is open to solicitations in the areas of enabling technologies for AN.

The AN is the airborne extension of the Air Force's ConstellationNet portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG). 

The AN is defined to be an infrastructure that provides communication transport services through at least one node that is on a platform capable of flight.  This can best be visualized in the context of the operating domains served by the GIG.  The Transformational Communications Satellite System (TSAT) network will provide space connectivity and the GIG-Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) network together with networks such as those provided under the Combat Information Transport System and Theater Deployable Communications will provide surface connectivity.  Airborne connectivity within the GIG will be provided by the AN.  The AN will connect to both the space and surface networks, making it an integral part of the communications fabric of the GIG.

The AN will differ from the existing terrestrial and space-based networks due to the unique environment. The AN will be composed of subnetworks of heterogeneous networks and links. Airborne platforms will enter and leave different subnetworks and the AN as they transit through the area at speeds of up to Mach 2. Links making up the subnetworks and the AN will consist of a collection of differing types to include point-to-point, broadcast, ad hoc, simplex plus many other kinds.    

To realize the AF vision for the AN, this extension of the GIG in the airborne domain must be easy to use, configure, and maintain and must provide:

Ubiquitous and assured network access to all Air Force platforms; 

GIG core services whose integrity is assured; 

Quality appropriate to the commander's intent and rules of engagement (ROE);

Rapid response to mission growth, emerging events and changing mission priorities; 

End-to-end interoperation with joint services, coalition, and non-DoD partners and legacy systems in all physical network domains (sub-surface, surface, airborne and space); 

The eventual AN will exist on a variety of airborne platforms.  Each air asset/platform may have a different network role within the AN:

Legacy – Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems capable of supporting voice, tactical data link (TDL), and possibly some point-to-point Internet Protocol (IP) network connections for very limited services (e.g., email only).  The term "legacy" also includes any non-IP enabled hardware/software on any platform.

Relay/Gateway - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems as described for a legacy node, but also include equipment that enable them to access multiple TDLs and to relay data Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), or transfer data formats from one link to another.

Network Access – Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which provides an IP network connection to an AN or GIG network node.  Although these nodes are tethered to the network, they do not provide any AN service to other nodes on the network.

Network Capable – Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can join an IP data network (Tactical Subnet) and provide limited AN service (e.g., transit routing) to other nodes on that local network.  

Internetwork – Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can access and interconnect multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes when interconnected to the GIG through a Network Service Provider node.  

Network Service Provider – Airborne platforms, fixed or deployed ground facilities, or space-based packages equipped with IP network capable communications systems, which can access multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to interconnect with a GIG network (e.g., Defense Information Support Network (DISN), Joint Task Force (JTF) Service Component Network, etc.) service delivery node (SDN) and to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes.  

Candidate areas of research to solve AN-unique problems or show feasibility (or non-feasibility) of solutions that will enable the eventual fielding of this capability as applied/integrated to the airborne networking environment, include, but are not limited to: 

1) Airborne Networking Modeling and Simulation: Some of the areas are: Network Centric Warfare (NCW) based AN to the current set of Air Force missions and flexible enough to adapt to emerging mission sets; AN components modeling (e.g. Link 16 and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)); measures of effectiveness and performance assessment; analyses of mobile communication network node's [platforms] flight-plan-adjustments [metrics, mechanisms, algorithms, and equipment] to enable the optimization of communications performance and network connectivity; dynamic ad hoc networks management; mobile IP information routing; multi-mission network centric warfare environments; analysis of alternatives; support for real-time decision-making, dynamic situation assessment, dynamic prediction, predictive assessments, operationally focused/embedded simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, course of action analyses; AN training; develop experimental hardware and software in the laboratory and conduct experiments and demonstrations; and perform integration and validation and verification of models, simulations, enterprise management performance, airborne link and routing performance, and other solutions as required.  It is assumed that components will integrate into a complete M&S environment.  

2) Airborne Network Enterprise Management (EM):  This area can be broken down into six sub-areas, each with unique airborne asset considerations: event assessment, policy networking, course of action generation, mission-based understanding, cross-domain capability, and cross-cutting concerns (with includes security).  

    -  Event assessment may include the ability to "see" the status of nearby coalition, joint service or other component networks in order to obtain a larger perspective of network status.  The clustered nature of the AN, with nodes moving in and out of range of each other, will require consideration.  

    -  Policy Networking (i.e. policy-based networking) may be used to facilitate the need for manageable end-to-end, mission-based quality-of-service.  

    -  Courses of action could be generated by, but limited to, faster-than-real-time simulation, predictive network planning, established doctrine/policy, and documented response.  Course of action methods to reconfigure network nodes to compensate for an anomalous event could be based on prediction of topology and connectivity changes. 

    -  Mission understanding includes a "relative," individualized mission criticality as well as potential mapping to a larger globally accepted criticality.

    -    Cross-Domain capability:  Multi-layer security and monitoring/controlling multiple domains from a single domain based on mutual agreements.  

    -  Cross-cutting Concerns include (1) standardized methods (e.g. intelligent agents) for monitoring/managing (or tying to resident monitoring/managing capability) legacy systems; (2) Information Assurance (IA), as well as platform-based network defense, must be integrated into EM solutions; (3) Network Services should consider Domain Name Service (DNS), network time, network addressing, and service location services/protocol; (4) considerations for on-platform EM Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for inexperienced airborne operators; (5) DoD and AF projected architecture models and standards, e.g., service oriented architecture, IPv6 integration, etc.  This also includes Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES):  Application/Platform Services, Collaboration Services, Discovery Services, Enterprise Management Services, Messaging Services, Security Services, Storage Services, and User Assistance Services.

3) Airborne Networking and Communications Links:  We are looking for innovative ideas involving networking and communications links that will help enable this future capability. Such techniques and ideas may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: methods by which nodes will address and route traffic between heterogeneous subnetworks in conditions that are dynamic, with rapidly changing network topologies; methods to alleviate the impacts upon the network of changing connectivity with links/nodes entering/leaving networks; techniques to enable traffic priority and Quality of Service (QoS) to make optimal use of the limited resources possibly including the concepts of content delivery networking (CDN) and/or content-based routing; mechanisms to enable existing and future wire-line based protocols to operate over wireless links and networks as well as the means to handle the security and information assurance problems associated with using these protocols; mechanisms to enable the use of IPv4/IPv6 (dual-stack) in coexistence; policy-based networking techniques; new high bandwidth, high quality, communications links; advanced error detection, error correction and compressions schemes; and antenna designs for improved performance on airborne platforms.

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:    In addition to Government employees, the Government intends to use employees from a non-Government source (MITRE) to assist as technical advisors, in the evaluation of the proposals. Representatives of the foregoing firm participating in the evaluation process will sign non-disclosure agreements in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Should anyone not wish to have his/her proposal viewed by individuals from this organization, a statement to that effect must be included in the cover letter.  Otherwise, by submission of the proposal, you agree that your proposal information may be disclosed to those employees of the organization identified above for the limited purpose stated above. Only Government evaluators, however, will make award recommendations under this BAA.  Advisors will assist in the evaluation and provide input regarding the strengths, weaknesses, proposal inadequacies, risks, and deficiencies in proposals. They will not determine ratings or rankings of offerors' proposals.  Access to offeror proposals will be restricted to only those portions for which the advisor's expertise is required in the evaluation.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has also contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the nature of the particular effort, the offeror may be required to share information about the software and inputs and/or output files or data required for subsequent portions of the effort with other participants in this BAA.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with Woods & Poole Economics, Inc., 1794 Columbia Road NW, Ste 4, Washington, DC 20009-2808 for Census Tract Population Estimates by Sex and Age.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The contractor shall provide annual population estimates in greater geographical detail than those produced by the Bureau of the Census.  These specially-developed census tract population estimates will enable NCI scientists to better assess sociodemographic patterns and disparities in cancer rates and will be used to produce cancer statistics and to monitor trends over time by such characteristics as poverty status, education, and income level, as well as by other population socioeconomic characteristics.  In addition to meeting crucial NCI data needs, some of these special census tract population estimates will be made publicly available and will be extensively used by health researchers throughout the United States. Two versions of each data set shall be provided:  one set shall be population rounded to whole numbers and the second set shall be in unrounded population with "fractional" people calculated to the 4th decimal place.  The data set shall be residential population by gender by age in 5-year cohorts plus one single year estimate for age 0.  There would be 19 age groups for both male and female that sum to total residential population. Additionally, the contractor shall develop these estimates in such a way that they will sum to county population totals provided by the NCI for each age group, sex and year.  An important feature of the census tract population time series data that is crucial to the needs of the NCI is that it is consistent across racial/ethnic definition changes, geographic boundary changes, and decennial Census results since 1970.  The contractor will provide population estimates for all years in seven different time series.  Data Sets #1 through #6 may be made available on an NCI public web site as long as a link to the contractor’s web site is provided and as long as the contractor’s description of the data sources, estimation methods, and limitations of the data are also made available. At the commencement of work, NCI will provide the contractor with county population control totals by age group, sex, and year.  NCI may also provide 1990 census tract populations by age group and sex as additional control totals.  All data set versions shall be provided to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program within ninety days after award. The contractor is the only source known to the NCI able to develop the specialized census tract population estimates that are required by the NCI within the timeframe required under this procurement.  The contractor has knowledge and expertise in identifying and utilizing various data resources required for developing detailed population estimates and projections in non-census years and they have provided detailed population estimates to the Surveillance Research Program in the past and these estimates were used extensively to produce required annual cancer statistics that are presented to the NCI Director, on NCI web sites, and that appear in publications and in publicly available software programs.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EST on December 19, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Rachelle Moore, 254-288-9578
<DESC>The Government intends to issue a full and open, non-restrictive solicitation to industry for the U.S. Army Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas.  The contract type will be an Indefinite Delivery Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Fi xed Price.  The contract will be for a base and three one-year options. The contractor shall design, develop, and fabricate an Alternative Power Source prototype fuel cell. This fuel cell shall be self-contained and operate autonomously to provide sustaine d power on a continuous basis in support of operational test instrumentation.  The contractor shall produce low rate of initial production fuel cell units and produce production units.  The specified quantities will be specified per delivery order. The Alt ernative Power Source Fuel Cell (herein after referred to as fuel cell) is to be a compact, lightweight (compared to current use of deep-cycle marine batteries) source of power for test instrumentation on Army ground tactical and non-tactical vehicles. The  fuel cell shall operate on a continuous basis for at least 80 hours before refueling and shall have an expected operating life of at least three (3) years with a minimum of ten (10) cycles (fuel/field use/refuel) per year. Industry is alerted that previou s developments and testing of an experimental Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) indicated problems in two areas: (1) There was loss of hydrophobicity and ruthenium migration in the membrane assemblies. (2) The fuel cell stack experienced cathode flooding wh ich prevented the chemical reaction between oxygen and the methanol solution. (3) The degrading mechanism was related to the external air manifold design that placed constraints on operation and reliability of the DMFC stack. Offerors are advised that cont ractor may serve as technical advisors in the source selection process.  These individuals will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties.

<DESC>This synopsis is for a noncommercial engineering effort to integrate and test a lightweight stabilized remote turret on the Vigilante" Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has a requirement to integrate lightweight stabilized remote turret on a VTOL UAV platform. The objective of the program is to demonstrate a targeting and sniper capability onboard an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) , a capability never seen in battle.  Having the ability to accurately engage single point man sized targets with an airborne UAV will give the ground based soldier the ability to have a high-point survivable sniper at their disposal when needed.  An airbo rne UAV can rapidly achieve lookdown angles and viewpoints required for sniper engagements, while controlled from the troop on the ground.  Demonstrating this capability is the goal of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System (ARSS). The ARSS effort is to i ntegrate and test the Utah State University Research Foundations (USURF) developed Precision Weapon Platform (PWP) lightweight stabilized remote turret on the Vigilante" Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV in support of the Aerial Delivery of Effects from Lightweight Aircraft (ADELA) program.  While airborne in a Hover Out of Ground Effect (HOGE) condition and controlled from a ground based control station using existing control data links onboard, the Vigilante" UAV system will demonstrate the Precisi on Weapons Platform (PWP) capability. AATD will use its Government-owned Vigilante" as the VTOL UAV testbed platform for this effort.   AATD intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis for award of a cost reimbursable contract entitled Auton omous Rotorcraft Sniper System (ARSS) with Advanced Technologies Incorporated (ATI), 875 Middle Ground Blvd., Newport News, VA 23606-4209 (CAGE: 0KT86), a small business Aircraft Research & development firm, and manufacturer of the Vigilante".   According ly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l) and FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy this agency's requirements.   This effort, using Vigilante" as the testbed, is a cont inuation to reach the goals identified in the Army Technology Investment Agreement, DAAH10-01-2-0003, Armed VTOL UAV Testbed Integration (AVUTI).  This effort will further AATDs research to develop an armed UAV that will improve the quality of military op erations and enhance the capability of our weapon systems.  Using the Vigilante" as the testbed provides significant cost leverage for this Army effort.  The ATI developed Vigilante" is a residual asset on hand and readily available from the Armed VTOL UA V Testbed Integration (AVUTI) program.  This Government owned UAV would be furnished to ATI at no cost to support this effort. Using the Vigilante" as the testbed provides significant cost leverage for this Army effort.  The Governments substantial inves tment would be duplicated if another contractor performed this effort using a different VTOL UAV and that loss would not be offset or recovered in this or related acquisitions.  This program, using Vigilante" as the testbed, continues our efforts to integr ate and demonstrate various weapons on a VTOL UAV as we investigate technologies that that will improve the quality of military operations and enhance the capability of our weapon systems.  Based on our market research, ATI is the only available source for  Vigilante" integration support.  The ATI team has the knowledge and data rights and experience to electronically and mechanically integrate the PWP system onto the Vigilante" and perform other Statement of Work tasks.  The ATI teams vehicle and flight sy stems support is critical to ensure the integration of the turret will be compatible with and not degrade the performance of the Vigilante".  ATI has the knowle dge and extensive experience of the Vigilante" UAV to successfully fulfill the proposed contract requirements.  The ATI team is uniquely qualified to fulfill the contract requirement based on its sole access to the proprietary Vigilante" technical design d ata and software, simulator, flight vehicle and flight trained personnel to provide the Army with an integration and test capability of the PWP onto the Vigilante".  It would not be economically viable to attempt to acquire this data by other means.   The likelihood of an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Governments investment in the Armed VTOL UAV Testbed Integration technology and is not expected to be recovered through competition.  ATI will continue to subcontract for flight system support from SAIC. The Armed VTOL UAV Testbed Integration has been a collective research effort between ATI and SAIC.  ATI, partnered with SAIC, are the only firms with the detailed experience and knowledge to support integr ation of Mission Equipment and weapons on the Vigilante and support UAV operations at the same time.   SAIC specifically designed the flight system for the Vigilante and no other source has the proprietary software needed to update the flight system for th is effort.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to ATI, Inc. A solicitation document is not available.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and ATI into a m odel contract, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  The resultant contract will consist of a fourteen (14) month performance period.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this research and development effort is 541710. The size standard is 1500.  No options are anticipated for this program. While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal, which shall b e considered. Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Sandra Schuck, 757-878-4819, Building 401, Lee Blvd, Ft Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Contracting Officer is Ms. Rhonda Buckanin.

Aviation Applied Technology Directorate has a requirement for a Research and Development program to integrate and develop a lightweight stabilized remote turret  on the Vigilante" Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV platform.  The objective of the program is to demonstrate a targeting and sniper capability onboard an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), a capability never seen in battle.

Demonstrating this capability is the goal of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System (ARSS). AATD will use its Government-owned Vigilante" as the VTOL UAV testbed platform for this  effort. AATD intends to award a cost-reimbursable contract to Utah State University Research Foundation (USURF).  10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development ca pability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center. Utah State University (USU) created USURF in 1967 as a nonprofit corporation owned by USU. Its purpose is to provide an organiza tion for the management and physical support of applied research, the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of innovative technologies. USURF seeks to contribute to the fundamental strength of research and development within the University by transfor ming knowledge into products and services through the application of knowledge and through creative expression to produce creative works.  Among USURFs areas of emphasis is imaging systems.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source require ments, will be limited to USURF.   USURF has developed a highly stable, lightweight turret designed to carry sensor payloads in aircraft.  This turret is the suitable for use in this program because of its lightweight.  The program seeks to integrate a tur ret for the program onto a 1,000lb class UAV.  UAVs in this range have a payload capacity in the 200 lbs range, which includes all sensors, weapons, and mounting and control hardware.  The weapons payload for this size UAV would weigh approximately 75 lbs.   USURF possesses a fully stabilized, articulated, modular turret with sufficient accuracy to engage small point targets with the necessary firepower.  The USURF lightweight permits other equipment necessary for this program to be incorporated on the platf orm as well.  The turret has significant potential to meet program goals and maintain RD&E capability in a non-profit institution.  Based upon market research, not only is USURF the only non-profit institution with such a turret, but also is the only sourc e with such a lightweight, precision turret.  The program is deemed to fall within USURFs charter and USURF is uniquely situated to support the program.   The period of performance is fourteen (14) months for this program. The North American Industry Clas sification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  This size standard is 1500. No options are anticipated for this program.

Paragraph I. Funding Opportunity Description is revised to read as follows:

"I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate, Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Program Office of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for the development and/or adaptation of C2 and Intel systems to be capable of exploiting the power of a JBI information management system (reference the following US Air Force [USAF] Scientific Advisory Board's "Report on Building the Joint Battlespace Infosphere Volume 1: Summary" for JBI concepts and definitions: http://www.rl.af.mil/programs/jbi/documents/JBIVolume1.pdf).  The objective of this BAA will be to explore innovative technical solutions and to design, develop and demonstrate prototype software components for integrating existing C2 applications into a JBI information space that supports future Net Centric Operations (NCO) infrastructures such as the Air Force's ConstellationNet concept.  Critical to achieving this objective it to ascertain how a JBI information space and a collection of well-designed client applications that utilize the information space can improve warfighter awareness, capabilities and interoperability without adversely impacting evolving C2 systems, data flow among these C2 systems, networks, common operating environments, and existing concepts of operation.

JBI information management services enable an interoperable information space to aggregates, integrates, fuses, and intelligently disseminates relevant battlespace information to support decision-making at all echelons of a Joint Task Force (JTF), delivering "Decision Quality" information to the warfighter. It is intended to serve as an integrating substrate upon which legacy and emerging systems can be linked together to support transparent information exchange across the full spectrum of mission activities and functional domains.

One of the primary goals of the JBI project is to develop an information interoperability infrastructure that connects disparate software applications or "clients," and facilitates information exchange between these clients creating a cohesive combat information management system.  Another goal of the JBI project is to integrate existing C2 and Intel systems within an information space without replacing these systems.  To that end, this BAA will provide the design considerations, software components and technical know-how to integrate pertinent existing clients within a JBI enabled  information space. 

Contractors shall work with AFRL as concept and prototype component software designers and developers and shall provide integration support of their client adaptation concepts/components among specified C2 and Intel systems to achieve stated objectives.  Final demonstrations will be conducted at one or more Government facilities.  Several scenarios and targeted operational domains shall be considered during the period of performance and will be guided by input from potential end user representatives from across the operational Air Force community.  Strongest consideration will be given to those proposals in which coordination with an end user is clearly established especially concerning solutions with respect to tactical domain problems.  The goal should be to deliver a demonstration of the technology to the end user.

Potential offerors will need to perform a subset of the following tasks:  

(1) Identify and document concepts, techniques and technologies for integrating existing USAF or Joint/Coalition systems/applications into a JBI information space with positive impact to the operation of these systems and minimal impact to the operator/warfighter.  C2 and Intel systems and applications across the functional spectrum from the actual platform carrying out a mission/task to the Combatant Commander dictating strategies and tactics will be considered. 

(2) Identify and document transition opportunities and strategies for JBI information management services and adapted clients to meet warriors' needs.  Describe approaches that balance the co-evolution of C2/Intel concepts and technologies in a manner that addresses critical accreditation, common operating environment, security, survivability, operation over unreliable communication links, system administration, long-term maintenance and other issues that plague designers of to-be-fielded systems.   It is expected that transition will occur gradually and will only happen, if at each phase, client applications maintain a low profile/footprint with minimal overhead, yet provides added value to the warfighter.  Added value is defined as either providing operators access to information or capabilities they never had before or providing better machine-to-machine interface flexibility and/or affordability than an existing interface governed by a rigid and costly ICD; or both.

(3)  Design, develop, test, integrate and demonstrate adapted legacy client components that form an information bridge between true legacy applications/systems for the creation of a JBI enabled infospace. Depending upon the scenario; targeted warfighter domain; participating legacy C2/Intel systems, applications, nodes and platforms; demonstration location; and capabilities of a JBI infospace, the following examples of legacy client components may be adapted and assembled:

a. Embedded Components.  Resides on a military platform such as an aircraft or vehicle, maintains a low software footprint and is strategically "wrapped" as another on-board feature that meets platform processing, look and feel (graphical or other presentation), weight restrictions and other stringent guidelines subject to accreditation.  The embedded component shall communicate with other C2 nodes and data link gateways via standard tactical communication links.

b. C2 Node Components.  Resides on more capable military platforms that act as C2 nodes (UMAV, AWACS, JSTARS, or their ground stations etc) that have adequate bandwidth and access to a JBI configuration.  These components interact with the CAPI and act as proxies for the more disadvantaged embedded components.  C2 node components can aggregate or selectively control data flow to embedded components based on the information exchanged.  They can also interact with either the data or information link side of the gateway components depending upon their task.

c. Data Link-Information Link Gateway Components.  These components act as translators, filters or aggregators between publishers/subscribers in a data link network and publishers/subscribers in an information link network.  Consider a subscriber on an Information Link (infospace) who needs access to information whose ultimate source produced by a node on a Link-16 network.  In this example, a subscription on an Information Link should theoretically be translated to a subscription on a data link and once received via data link subscription, properly translated and published to the information link for the subscriber and other consumers.

d. Legacy Client Components.  If processing power is available, add-on development is feasible, and the client application software can still be compliant in a common operating environment (e.g., Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment [DII/COE] or others) despite JBI client requirements, then JBI-Legacy client components would be preferred.  These client components should integrate seamlessly into the host application and its underlying infrastructure.

e. Native Client Components.  Brand new components to showcase JBI infrastructure capabilities that either are not concerned with specific run-time environment restrictions, or other compliance issues, and are generally assumed to demonstrate a new capability not in a legacy system's arsenal.

(4)  For any specialized embedded software, hardware, networking or communications links that are proposed, it is up to the potential offerors to outline additional requirements to make demonstrations successful.  For example, if a JTIDS terminal is required in which a small software process would be embedded to act as a datalink-infolink gateway client, document it, state the costs, and be cognizant of the fact that some demonstration locations will not have direct line of sight (LOS) to the JTIDS in the sky.  If it is better to acquire or have access to datalink simulators, clearly describe your (and AFRL's) acquisition approach and any upfront costs.  If you propose an embedded component that would provide an F15-E pilot a window into the infospace onboard the aircraft, describe your approach for "wrapping" the component and what other Government agencies AFRL/IF would need to coordinate with to ensure success.  If you believe you have a complete end-to-end solution involving the aforementioned components in a variety of platforms and command hierarchies, you should clearly state any proprietary components and any limitations (cost or otherwise) associated with production or fielding of your proposed solution.  In all cases, potential offerors should identify how they would interact with other Contractors awarded tasks under this effort in the absence of formal Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA)."

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice is to DELETE the responses provided in modification 10 posted on December 2, 2005 and provide revised responses. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification. 

Question: Can you clarify whether consortiums and teaming partnerships are restricted to small businesses? Understand the prime bidder needs to be a small business, but do all teaming partners?

Response: The stated intent of modification 09 dated November 18, 2005 remains unchanged. To reiterate, the Government is requesting responses ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 (Other Computer Related Services, including Software Installation Services, Computer Disaster Recovery Services) with an associated size standard of $21 Million or less receipts per year. Modification 09 further stated that responses from qualified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Small Businesses, Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums, and Teaming Partners were encouraged. To further clarify what Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums, and Teaming Partners mean, the following additional information is provided. In all cases, a small business or small businesses must submit the response, qualifying as a small business or small businesses under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the requirement, and large businesses are only allowable as subcontractors performing less than 50% of the work. Additional information about Small Business Joint Ventures may be found at the Small Business Administration website. 

Question: Is the closing date for this noon December 6th 2005?

Response: As the correction to the previous question does not materially impact the stated purpose of modification 09 to gather additional market research to determine whether or not there are qualified Small Businesses that can perform the Force Readiness Support Services requirements, the date for submission of responses is UNCHANGED.

GUIDELINES

A.	Guidance is provided from Federal Government and DoS Contracting and Procurement Regulations.  Since these guidelines do not consider the operational setting of Colombia, with its ongoing conflict, constant physical danger, and frequently remote sites where the NAU must conduct operations, the incumbent is required to demonstrate great originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity.  The incumbent will often need to initiate or substantially modify methods and procedures, which could result in significant program changes.

COMPLEXITY   The contractor employee performs Fixed Wing Flight Standardization oversight of U.S. Government, contractor and host nation airplane pilots operating in CONUS and OCONUS at multiple forward operating locations.  The contractor employee develops multi-national/multi-cultural Fixed Wing Pilot training programs, plans, policies, and procedures for the INL Office of Aviation, coordinates recommendations from Standardization Committees, consults with the Director of Operations regarding ongoing projects, provides guidance to contractor, and host nation instructor pilots and standardization instructor pilots, and oversees implementation of the program.  The contractor employee performs continuous analysis of ongoing programs to determine the requirement for new procedures/policies that will improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of aviation operations in support of the counter-narcotics mission. 

SCOPE AND EFFECT	Carrying out of assignments may involve extensive analysis and investigation in order to detect and resolve problems that could impact adversely the effectiveness of future international narcotics control programs. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA

A.	Skill in the operation of fixed wing aircraft as a flight instructor.  Certification as a U.S. FAA Flight Instructor, single engine land and multi-engine land is highly desirable; however, experience as an equivalent Military Fixed Wing instructor pilot is acceptable.  Incumbent should possess experience a Military or Civil Fixed Wing instrument flight instructor/evaluator.  Certification as a U.S. FAA Commercial Pilot with single engine land and multi-engine land instrument rating required as a minimum.

B.	Knowledge of and experience in the formulation of plans and policies pertaining to operations and unit level flight-training activities, as well as Flight Operations Procedures.

C.	Knowledge of tactical employment of Fixed Wing aircraft in counter-narcotics operation, including capabilities, limitations and techniques of employment of Aviation Division Aircraft.  Must have extensive experience as a flight instructor and/or standardization instructor pilot in the training and standardization of fixed wing pilots within a formal aircrew-training program.

D	Past Performance evaluation of applicant’s ability to perform under the contract.  In conducting the evaluation, the Government reserves the right to utilize all evaluation information available at the time of evaluation, whether provided by the applicant or obtained from other sources.

B.	COMPENSATION:  Compensation for the position will be negotiated as follows:  Level of experience will dictate the salary level within the grade range.  Entry level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position.  However, consideration will be given to the successful applicant’s experience that is specifically relevant to the position to be filled.  Number of years of relevant experience will determine at what step within the grade range the successful applicant will be compensated.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to assist in conducting an epidemiologic study assessing the relation between environmental factors and the development of gynecologic diseases such as endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a gynecologic disorder in which endometrial glands and stroma are located outside the uterine cavity.  These implants can be found anywhere in the pelvic, abdominal or thoracic cavity and eventually produce vesicles or hemorrhages that visually appear as blue, brown or black lesions.  Incidence of endometriosis is relatively unknown; prevalence is estimated to be approximately 10%-15% of women of reproductive age but can be higher among women seeking gynecologic care.  The disease may be accompanied by considerable co-morbidity (e.g., infertility or impaired fecundity) and possibly other chronic diseases such as autoimmune disorders and reproductive site cancers.  

Clinical diagnosis is exceedingly difficult and requires direct visualization of the lesions by laparoscopy or laparotomy.  Often, histologic confirmation in excised tissue is needed to corroborate disease.  Other diagnostic modalities have been tried, though with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, serum biomarkers, gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and self reported symptomology).  The gold standard for diagnosis remains visual confirmation by a trained gynecologic surgeon.   

Human evidence suggesting a possible role of environmental chemicals in the development of endometriosis comes from a handful of studies; however, the results are far from conclusive.  Etiologic study of endometriosis is difficult, in part, given the requirement that the disease be visualized impacting choice of comparison group.  Environmental investigation is further complicated by lifestyle and reproductive factors such as pregnancy and lactation history, which may impact serum concentrations of environmental chemicals. 

To advance the scientific community’s understanding of the impact, if any, of environmental factors and the development of endometriosis, a clinical sampling framework is needed for the recruitment of cases and a gynecologic comparison group.  However, a second comparison group comprising women randomly selected from the referent population for women seeking medical care and who are allegedly free of disease also is needed.  This latter population-based comparison group will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out endometriosis, to the extent possible.  Should another biomarker of endometriosis emerge in the near future, its incorporation into the study will be considered in lieu of the MRI to assess the presence or absence of disease.  The NICHD is planning to conduct an epidemiologic study assessing the relation between environmental factors and the development of gynecologic diseases such as endometriosis.  This study is in response to a growing body of evidence suggesting a relation between persistent environmental chemicals (e.g., organochlorine pesticides, polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and development of endometriosis in women.  It is anticipated that up to two clinical research sites will be needed for the study.

Scope: It is estimated that approximately 850 women aged 18-44 years undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy and approximately 187 population-based control women aged 18-44 years will need to be recruited and to complete the study protocol.  Women undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy will need to have a thorough diagnostic evaluation by trained gynecologic surgeons with regard to the presence or absence of gynecologic disorders including endometriosis.

At least three types of biologic specimens (e.g., blood, urine, adipose tissue) will be collected for the quantification of environmental chemicals and metabolites of lifestyle exposures (e.g., cotinine and phytoestrogens).  All toxicologic analyses will be performed by a single state-of-the-art laboratory for the detection and quantification of the agents of interest to the study.  A statistical analytic plan will be fully developed and implemented by the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development for the analysis of all data.
   
Objective: The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of environmental factors with regard to the etiology of endometriosis.  The environment is defined to include environmental agents and lifestyle factors (e.g., diet and cigarette smoking) purported to influence human reproduction including the development of endometriosis.  An added methodologic goal of this study is to empirically evaluate study findings with regard to choice of comparison group, given the challenges in sampling study participants introduced by the need for visualization of disease and other nuances related to care seeking behavior for gynecologic reasons.  


To be deemed capable to serve as one of two anticipated research sites for this study, a Small Business Concern must submit a written Capability Statement that clearly demonstrates the ability to:  
1) within 24 months, recruit at least 425 women aged 18-44 years prior to undergoing incident laparoscopy or laparotomy and retain them through completion of the study; 
2) ascertain disease status from medical records including operative reports for the 425 women; 
3) within 24 months, recruit and retain in the study at least 94 women aged 18-44 years randomly selected from the referent population of women undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy and who are free of endometriosis as determined by MRI; 
4) collect all interview and medical record data and MRI images;
5) collect all required and desired biospecimens such as blood, urine, adipose tissue, peritoneal fluid, and  endometrial tissue; 
6) create a repository of residual biospecimens; and 
7) produce, maintain, and ensure the quality of the large database for this study.

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on December 22, 2005.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside or partially set-aside for small businesses.

<DESC>A key goal of the Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Cancer Institute is to facilitate the development of promising imaging agents so they can be safely and effectively used in clinical trials to provide unique diagnostic, staging, and therapy selection and monitoring information. These facilitative efforts are broad in scope including pre-clinical development, creation of SOPs for CMC and QC, IND preparation and submission (including exploratory IND), supporting and conducting imaging clinical trials, and incorporating imaging into therapeutic trials. To support these activities, there are several specific resources including DCIDE for pre-clinical development, SAIC contract resources to assist in IND preparation, and a competitively selected core of 4 institutions contracted to perform Phase I/II Clinical Trials of new imaging agents. In addition the NCI supports a number of cooperative groups including the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) for the performance of larger multi-center trials both of imaging agents and integrating imaging into therapeutic trials.  In addition to developing agents for use in NCI sponsored clinical trials, it is hoped that such development will progress to provision of a useful agent for other investigational trials including commercial therapeutic drug development and eventually to a commercial imaging agent product.

In order to provide 18 FLT to support larger multi-center trials, NCI would like to engage a vendor that would be able to produce and distribute 18FLT on a unit dose basis to regional and national sites to support clinical trials. The key requirement would be for multi-dose production capability to the standards set in the QA and acceptance SOPs to support the existing IND. The product may be produced employing the CMC developed by NCI and submitted with the IND 71,260 or by an alternative CMC process that produces equivalent product. If an alternative CMC is employed it must be provided for submission to the FDA and accepted by the FDA. In the alternative a DMF may be filed but also must be accepted by the FDA. 

The successful proposal may be by a single vendor proposal or a subcontract among entities including academic institutions however the capability to produce the tracer under cGMP conditions and to distribute in a timely manner must be in evidence. The distribution coverage should be defined and will be evaluated in the selection of vendors. Cost proposal should be broken into 5 separate budget lines: 1) Cost of development and implementation of synthesis; 2) Cost of required documentation and filing; 3) Ongoing administrative cost to maintain capability in an active status; 4) Unit dose cost (adjusted for volume); and 5) delivery cost (may be broken into zones).  

Vendors will be provided copies of the FLT SOPs for CMC and QA as well as product acceptance criteria under a confidentiality agreement. These materials are to assist the potential vendors in responding to the RFP and cannot be copied and must be returned. 

SAIC reserves the right to make site visits to bidding vendors prior to the awarding of the contract and also reserves the right to inspection of the sites and records as required.

<SUBJECT>A--MARKET SURVEY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A DIRECTED ENERGY SYSTEM TO DEFEAT IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
<SOLNBR>W909MY-06-R-PM02
<RESPDATE>121905
<ARCHDATE>02172006
<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command - (C-E LCMC) Washington Sector, on behalf of the US Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, is conducting market resear ch to identify companies having technology, qualification and capabilities to demonstrate a directed energy capability to defeat improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  Specifically, the goal of the market research is to identify companies with mature system s or the ability to rapidly mature systems to defeat IEDs with directed energy technology.  Maturity for this market survey is defined as a minimum technology readiness (TRL) level of 6, or a clear path to demonstrate TRL 6 or greater within 12 to 24 month s.  A TRL 6 level of maturity is defined as a representative model or prototype system, well beyond a breadboard stage, which has been successfully tested in a relevant environment.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory enviro nment, or in a simulated operational environment. Success at achieving TRL 6 is demonstrated by achieving neutralization of a variety of representative IED targets, configured in a realistic setting.  Results of this market research may be used to formulat e a near-term technology maturation and limited fielding program that integrates directed energy technology onto a military ground vehicle or manned/unmanned platform.  A future program may include the following Performance Objectives:  Given approximate l ocations of concealed, fixed IED and vehicle-borne IED targets within 50-100 meters from the directed energy device, permanently disable or neutralize the IEDs ability to fire on passing vehicles by damaging, disabling or destroying their triggering mecha nisms, firing train components, or directly destroying the main explosive charge.  IEDs may include thick-shelled military munitions or improvised explosive packages adapted with integral triggers such as contact sensors, command-or remotely-fired triggers , as well as a wide range of possible explosive types and packaging. Concealment may include rubbish, animal carcasses, soil, rocks, metal sheets, guard rails, concrete, foams or other materials.  A future program may include the following Technical Object ives:  (a) Full definition of operating principles, underlying physics, interoperability and safety hazard mitigation required for military use.  (b) Test and evaluation of an existing or modified (if needed) prototype to address the performance objectives .  (c) Integration of a prototype into a selected GFE military ground vehicle or manned/unmanned platform to assess performance.  (d) Production of one or more refined prototypes for final testing.  Contractors who desire to participate in this market surv ey are encouraged to submit a white paper outlining the IED defeat approach and related information.  White papers should discuss a specific existing prototype design and its principles of operation, identify the types of IEDs that the technology can defea t, discuss available test evidence supporting a TRL 6 or greater maturity level, and provide test references.  White papers should also discuss related corporate experience and include points of contact.  White papers should be limited to five (5) pages. This is NOT a request for proposals.  The contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses.  All responses shall be prepared in MS Word and submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer, Peggy Melanson, at peggy.melan son@cacw.army.mil by COB 19 December 2005.  All requests for further information must be made in writing via email to either the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, Dena Johnson (carrodena.johnson@cacw.army.mil); telephone requests for additional i nformation will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Y--Elwha River Restoration - Market Research, Request for Information 1
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is providing construction acquisition services to the National Park Service (NPS) in support of their Elwha River Restoration program.  Construction projects that Reclamation plans to award contracts for include: the removal of two concrete dams on the Elwha River; the construction of a river diversion; construction of two water treatment plants; and other construction projects related to the mitigation measures for the removal of the two dams. The intent of this notice is to announce the availability of 'Elwha River Restoration Market Research Questionnaire 1' to interested potential offerors.  Reclamation is conducting market research to determine the level of interest in the construction industry in various potential construction contract business arrangements for the planned construction projects.  Interested prime contractors and subcontractors are invited to complete the Questionnaire.  Participation is voluntary and respondents will not be compensated for their participation.  The identity of respondents will not be revealed outside the Contracting Officer's staff.  A contract will not result directly from this market research and there may be future market research or acquisition planning announcements made regarding the Elwha River Restoration.   Background information on the Elwha River Restoration, the planned construction activities, instructions for completing the Questionnaire, and the Questionnaire itself will be available on or about December 6, 2005 in Adobe Acrobat PDF at http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction/index.html.  Completed Questionnaires will be accepted for a 45-day period beginning on the date the questionnaire is posted to the website. All responses must be accompanied by a completed Questionnaire.  Any responses not accompanied by a completed Questionnaire will not be considered.  The intent of Questionnaire No. 1 is to seek input on certain potential contracting arrangements for the Elwha River Restoration and to determine the level of interest among small businesses.  It is not a request for unsolicited information or product literature on: construction or building materials; construction management services; construction equipment; or, water treatment processes.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be sent to the ELWHA_Market_Research@pn.usbr.gov email address or mailed to the Contracting Officer's attention.  Phone calls will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- Broad Agency Announcement for Defense Acquisition Challenge Proposals
<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as â€œChallenge Proposalsâ€, proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that â€œchallengeâ€ an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the technology readiness level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be at least TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and at TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. DAC operational areas to be considered include improvements for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies that address the following areas: warfighter enhancements that specifically address: improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance, et al); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical, et al); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense, et al); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equip, combined equip, longer missions, better batteries, et al). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses: logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability, et al); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level, et al); surveillance; and tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification, et al). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses: planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level, et al); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight, et al); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training, et al).  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under â€œReference Materialsâ€ on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review panel. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption to the acquisition program. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; test article cost; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2007 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2006. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil . Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/submitted via the DAC website NLT 2400 hours EST, 12 January 2006. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY2007 templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review. Questions regarding DAC should be directed to defensechallenge@osd.mil or 703-602-3740.

This has provided potable water to more than 800,000 beneficiaries.

The offerors shall provide the local loop (including local switching and associated features), local transport between terminating locations within the City/ State service area, access to local long distance services, and access to and from inter-exchange carriers. The Contactor shall also provide dedicated circuits between sites within the City/State service areas as well as between a GSA customer site and an IXC POP.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541430.  The applicable size standard is $6M.  Commerce Business Daily Note 1 applies to this requirement.  The requirement is to apply high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight Air Force buses in accordance with the following Statement of Work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  Scope:  The 12th Mission Support Group Vehicle Management Flight (12 MSG/LGRV) requires application of a shrink-wrap style vinyl graphic to four sides of eight buses used by their distinguished visitor support section.  These buses are driven throughout the San Antonio area and are ridden by the highest-level executives in the Air Force and other DoD components and must meet the highest quality standards in terms of appearance and durability.

2.  Objective:  The overall objective of this requirement is to install high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight buses designated by the 12 MSG/LGRV.

3.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, transportation, equipment, tools, labor, supplies, materials, and supervision necessary to produce and install the vinyl wrap for each bus, unless otherwise stipulated.  The contractor is required to perform the required work on-site in a facility mutually agreed upon by the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV and the contractor is responsible for cleaning the work area daily.  The contractor will produce vinyl graphics, from designs supplied electronically by 12 MSG/LGRV, and apply them to the front, rear, left-hand, and right-hand side of each bus described in the listing of buses to wrap.  One exception is bus 04B2278.  This bus already has vinyl wrap applied.  It only requires application of the Randolph design, described below, to the right-hand side.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining the precise measurements of each vehicle to be covered, prior to production and installation of the vinyl wrap.  The front, rear, and left-hand side graphic are described as the “Recruiting design,” and the right-hand side graphic is described as the “Randolph design.”  The contractor is responsible for preparation of the vehicular surfaces prior to application of the vinyl wrap.  The designs will be applied, conforming to the contours of the vehicular body, covering each entire side and in the event of sectional overlap of the design panels, the graphic will match at the intersection of subject seams.  The panel(s) will extend the entire width of each body side with a minimum of 18-inch overlap onto the roof section of the vehicle(s).  The contractor will trim and fit the panels according to the window and door moldings, corrugated body panels, etc., to ensure all doors, windows, existing body panels, etc., are fully functional upon completion of the work.  Sections of the panels that cover windows or glass portions of the vehicle will be of the type that allow one-way viewing from the inside to the outside of the passenger carrying compartment.  The only exception to glass coverage is the windshield; it will not have any vinyl coverage.  Additionally, the contractor will remove exterior lighting assemblies, door handles, locks, cameras, etc. to properly install the vinyl wrap and reinstall the same prior to completion of the work.  All components removed and reinstalled by the contractor to facilitate installation of the vinyl wrap will be fully functional.  The contractor will apply the Recruiting design to the front, rear, and left-hand side of each bus and the Randolph design to the right-hand side of each bus.  The contractor will re-size the overall graphic to conform proportionally to the varying size of each vehicle.  Prior to production and application of the vinyl panels, the contractor will provide 12 MSG/LGRV digital imagery of re-sized graphics on a representative image of the subject vehicle for final approval.  The specific sequence of wrapping the subject buses is limited to availability from daily operations and will be coordinated/scheduled jointly between the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV.  Completion of the described work should be accomplished no later than 1 April 2006.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003]

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security
from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25,
2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the
Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to
prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from
incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code),
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50
percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of
substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or
substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic artnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as
an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law
107-296.
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this
Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met,
such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of
Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in
regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the
meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a
partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present
value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed
appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard
transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure.
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not
a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation
pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-
296 of November 25, 2002.

bid or proposal.

Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)
(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within prior to contract expiration [insert the period of time within which the Contracting Officer may exercise the option]; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days [60 days unless a different number of days is inserted] before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. 
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. 
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed _54  (months).

<ARCHDATE>12052006
<CONTACT>Patricia Fresquez-Hernandez Contracting Officer 5059886122     ;
<DESC>Combined Solicitation is being modified to: 1.  Change the Model of the Service Monitor that the NPS can provide, when available, for use by the contractor from an IFR-2390 to an IFR-2975. 2.  A copy of Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, can be acquired by accessing http://www.acqnet.gov/far. 3.  Provide the following additional information: Question:  The solicitation title states a conversion of existing radios (meaning existing radios will be modified) but the details state this is a replacement project.  Please clarify. Answer:  All radio equipment will be replaced with P-25 equipment. Question:  Does the existing system utilize the SmartNet protocol or any other type of protocol or standard? Answer:  IMR has more than 60 radio systems.  Most systems are "stand-alone" conventional VHF systems, and there are a few voting systems.  Again, all new systems will be P-25 digital.  Some of the systems have, or are tied into dispatch centers. Question:  Will replacement equipment items be at the remote sites prior to the arrival of a technician or will the technician have the responsibility to ensure safe delivery of equipment? Answer:  The equipment will be at the park.  Transportation of the equipment to individual radio sites will be provided by a combination of park staff and the technician.  For the majority of projects the park's staff will be available to assist with transportation. Question:  Is the technician responsible to transport replaced equipment away from the remote sites? Answer:  Yes.  Again, the majority of the time park staff will be on hand to assist but the technician would be coordinating the removal of the equipment.   Question:  If the technician must transport NPS-owned equipment, will the technician or his company be liable for any damage that may occur during transport to/from the sites? Answe:  Only if due to negligence.
