<DESC>APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  25 Sep 2004.  The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, Cost Plus Award Fee, follow-on contract for a base period and 6 one-year option periods.  This effort is to provide engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a seven-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include one-year options for the following six fiscal years (FY06 through FY11).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance.  AWPS/AAI provides tools for production management, operations and quality review, damage calculations, and plan analysis.  Upcoming enhancements and development projects are potentially as follows: continuation of software improvement and maintenance efforts using SQL, PowerBuilder, Fortran; possible conversion all FORTRAN applications to C++.  The ISPAN program is undergoing modernization, based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directions.  AWPS/AAI may require some new development and tools integration efforts.  Currently, the data base management system is Sybase, but efforts are underway to migrate to the Oracle platform.  All software will be maintained and developed in accordance with applicable DOD and AF regulations and standards, and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and Architectures.  The contractor must maintain a SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for SECRET documents and equipment.  All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance.  Any contractor personnel required to work on the  ISPAN computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed.  This acquisition will not be conducted using commercial procedures per FAR Part 12.  The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry.  No solicitation is available at this time.  Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner.  All associated documents will be released electronically.  The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $21M.  Anticipated award date is 17 Nov 2004.

Proposals shall be mailed to 325 CONS/LGCBA, ATTN: Wanda Cutchin, 501 Illinois Avenue Suite 5, Tyndall AFB FL 32403-5526, marked for BAA TYN 05-001 or e-mailed to wanda.cutchin@tyndall.af.mil.

Requirements: The Air Force requires advanced technologies that facilitate the conduct of contingency base operations, combat support functions, and force protection in both homeland security and Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) operations.  In addition, provide opportunities for reduction of weight, volume, and costs of base emergency response, infrastructure support, and combat support systems.  

AFRL/MLQ solicits cutting edge proposals in the following general technology areas:  

Atmospheric Threat Protection - Identify characteristic emissions or patterns that enable detection, identification, and/or modeling of anthropogenic chemicals in or transported through the atmosphere.  Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling localization and/or identification of these emission sources, for example storage, use, or accidental/deliberate release of toxic chemicals.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from atmospheric threats, either inside or adjacent to forward operating bases, and that may contribute to reducing or eliminating threats to personnel and equipment.  

Protective Technologies - Develop chemical processes and passive or self-decontaminating materials that will reduce recovery time and provide a significant improvement in decontamination capabilities.  Develop sensing, active and passive protection, and decontamination technologies for improved force protection at fixed and forward bare airbases.  Develop systems for detecting and quantifying toxic materials or hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, and energetic).  Provide technology for automated hazard warning/avoidance, neutralization or decontamination, and decontamination validation in operational areas and industrial sites.  Develop technologies to technician operable/maintainable, affordable, deployable and modular, allowing rapid mobilization and demobilization.  Hazard avoidance during operations will allow sustained operations tempo; assurance of effective decontamination of equipment and operational areas; and ability to continue operations in “shirtsleeve” environment.  

Explosive Effects Mitigation – Identify explosive characteristic effects or patterns that enable detection, evaluation, and/or modeling of the explosive and resulting effects.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate protective technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from blast, ballistic, and fragmentation effects.  Develop new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies to mitigate blast effects resulting in reduced injuries and deaths to building/shelter occupants.  

Shelters – Develop new and advanced shelters that are lightweight and low volume, easy to erect, and requires low maintenance.  The new shelter will be used for housing personnel and aircraft maintenance and storage for long term and under harsh environments.  Specific areas of interest include: airbeam technology based on lightweight and high strength fibers integrated solar power and corporation of chem/bio and directed energy protection into shelter.  

Air Base Operating Surfaces  - Develop lightweight portable airfield evaluation technologies for surface and subsurface material characterization, expedient repair materials and techniques, lightweight high-strength materials, and measurement and prediction in response to traffic and environmental loads.  

Protection of Deployed Forces and Assets  - Develop lightweight rapidly deployable personnel and aircraft shelters, and protection systems for facilities and aircraft parking areas.  Specific areas of interest include ultra-lightweight, high-strength materials, exploitation of in situ materials, and post-construction reinforcement of facilities, simulation and modeling of effects of air-blast and fragmentation, and chemical/biological protection systems.  

Combat Utility Systems – Develop new energy and utility systems technologies that increase mobility, reliability, and efficiency on all deployable utilities required for AEF operations.  Specific areas of interest include: fuel reforming to produce hydrogen, fermentative and photosynthetic production of hydrogen from deployed base waste streams, active and passive power generation, power conditioning and distribution systems, environmental control units, and solid/liquid deployable waste management systems.  

Robotics/Explosive Ordnance Disposal – Develop automation technologies for use in high threat areas for AEF and related uses. The specific areas of interest include new technology for: explosive ordnance and mine detection, characterization, and disposal, including buried, surface and underwater ordnance; ground vehicle navigation and guidance; sensing systems; robotic vehicle systems, including teleoperation and automation technology; site survey vehicles; and related automated construction technologies.  

Fire Fighting - Develop agents, systems, equipment and hardware for use in aircraft firefighting and rescue operations, airbase structural firefighting, weapons systems firefighting, hazardous materials incidents, and improved firefighter training.  Develop DoD firefighting systems such as munitions protection and explosion mitigation.  Specific areas of interest include the development of environmentally compatible, operationally and cost effective fire extinguishing agents, aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles/systems, fire detection/suppression systems, specialized rescue and personnel protective equipment, and training technologies.  The objective is to enhance airbase and other DoD firefighting safety programs and training capabilities that significantly reduce the amount of time to extinguish fires, extract victims, and minimize damage/casualties.  

Biocatalytic Materials Synthesis – High-performance space and aerospace materials are often produced by complex sequences of reactions involving toxic solvents and expensive catalysts.  Some materials are derived from structures that are difficult to make via traditional synthetic chemical techniques.  Successful development of green chemistry approaches to materials synthesis would not only reduce the cost of the material, but also eliminate negative environmental impacts.  One successful approach for synthesis of industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural chemicals involves biocatalysis – the use of living cells or enzymes as catalysts for chemical reactions.  Biocatalysis may yield novel materials or better synthetic pathways to known materials by allowing targeted production of specific structures under mild conditions required to support biological processes.

Proposal Preparation: Responses submitted shall include a proposal for technical and cost/price as follows: (a) The technical proposal must include an outline and full discussion of the nature and scope of the research, the method or technical approach, and the expected results of each proposal. This proposal should offer scientific advancement in the state of the art. The technical proposal must identify privately developed items, components, processes or computer software entailed in their proposed approach, if any. Information must be included on prior work/experience in the indicated field of research and the available facilities. Management resources shall include resumes of people who will be participating in the proposed design effort, and identify the principal investigator. (b) The cost/price proposal requires submission of cost or pricing data IAW FAR 15.403-5 with a supporting detailed cost schedule and shall contain a per person/hour breakdown per task. FAR 15.403-5 may be located at http//www.arnet.gov.far/ The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will compete for contract award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements set forth above. That value will be determined using a complex combination of criteria including the technical promise (originality, feasibility, desirability, etc.), affordability (of development, considering technical alternatives and funding available, and of implementation if otherwise successful), and the government's confidence in the effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror's understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, or other technical personnel, offeror's overall corporate experience (including past performance), and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, a part thereof or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Technical consideration will be given greater weight than cost in the selection decision. No further evaluation criteria will be used in source selection. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Deliverable Items: (a) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), DI-MISC-81183A, (b) Contractors Progress Status and Management Report, DI-MGMT-80227, (c) Still Photographic Records, DI-MISC-81206, (d) Presentation Material, DI-ADMN-81373, (e) Scientific and Technical Reports, DI-MISC-80711 (Draft and reproducible final, AFRL/MLQ format).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued.  This solicitation number is FA8901-04-R-0036 and is issued as a Request for Quote.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 334111.  The request is for the purchase of the following:  XC2-01-1000, XC2 Backflow Prevention Software - 1000 - 14 Systems.  Code:  XC2Picts-01, XC2Picts Image Capture and storage-14 Systems.  AFIOH/RSEW has been tasked to provide Cross-Connections/backflow prevention devices surveys for 16 ACC bases.  Each of these bases require a software program to track all backflow prevention devices and any cross connections found.  XC2 Backflow Prevention Management Software has been chosen by HQ ACC to be used throughout the Command. If different software packages were to be used at each base, the teams doing the surveys would have to learn eight (8) different software packages and train each base on a separate package.  This would also cause unacceptable delays in accomplishing the surveys under the contract.  Each survey would have to be completed in its entirety before the next base could be started.  Standardizing on a single preapproved software package will expedite eliminating health hazards found in the survey.  EngSoft Solutions is the only known source that provides the XC2 Backflow Prevention Software that has been accredited for use in sensitive, unclassified operations.  The purchase of this software from EngSoft Solutions is in the best interest of the Air Force because this is the only Backflow Management software program that has been certified.  The contractor is the only known contractor experienced in working with AFIOH and that can provide the unique software for tracking all backflow prevention devices and any cross connections found.  This contractor is the only known source of Backflow Management software program engineering skills that has knowledge of the background within which these disparate software packages can be used, how they are used, and what are knowledgeable of AFIOH's capability needs.  Delivery will be made to AFIOH/DOT, Brooks City-Base, TX.  Provisions to include FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2004); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Oct 2003); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (Apr 2004) apply to this acquisition.  Karla Dodd is the primary contact point for information regarding this requirement.  Her phone number is (210) 536-2629.  Ms Christu Jackson will be the secondary point of contact.  Her phone number is (210) 536-3003.

SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: 04-Q-0425
SEPT. 24, 2004 SITE VISIT MINUTES

SITE VISIT START: 1300	                                                  SITE VISIT END: 1430

	The following subjects and questions were discussed at the September 24, 2004 site visit at the Child Development Center for synopsis/solicitation 04-Q-0425, Carpet Installation.  The attendees were:

			
				Ms. Hebert		Contract Specialist
				Ms. McLamb		CDC Director
				Mr. Gerald		Abbey Carpet
				Mr. Grimes		Commercial Floor Covering
				Mr. Horne		Commercial Floor Covering
				Ms. Smith		Gomez Floor Covering
				Mr. Baker		Gomez Floor Covering
				Mr. Ratley		Raeford Floor & Wall
				Mr. Porter		Premiere Carpets

1)	Ms. Hebert began the meeting by giving all attendees a copy of the floor plan for building 3710, Child Development Center.  

2)	Ms. McLamb provided a tour through the facility and stressed the importance of taking all measurements quietly due to sleeping children.  She informed the attendees that carpet installation must occur after hours through the week or during specified weekend hours.  This will ensure the mission of the CDC is not disturbed.  

3)	Mr. Gerald of Abbey Carpet asked the question of rubber basing being provided for the entire room, since most rooms are only half-carpeted.  Ms. Hebert informed the group that CLIN 0002 specifies rubber basing for the entire building (approx. 1440 linear feet).  The project would not look aesthetically pleasing if only the carpeted areas were replaced.

4)	Ms. Smith asked the question of items being removed from the furnishings during installation.  Ms. McLamb responded that all items must remain on the furnishings.  She stated that her whenever her personnel move shelves around, there are no problems with the items falling off.   

5)	The question of the closing date was addressed and most vendors felt a time constraint in getting the CDC and Dining Facility proposals finished on time.  Ms. Hebert informed the group that the Dining Facility quote would be amended to 28 Sep 04 @ 1100 in order to assist with this matter. 

6)	Ms. Hebert thanked the group for attending and asked that all vendors submit their quotes in accordance with the line items listed on each solicitation.  This will expedite the evaluation process.

SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: 04-Q-0425
SEPT. 24, 2004 SITE VISIT MINUTES

SITE VISIT START: 1300	                                                  SITE VISIT END: 1430

	The following subjects and questions were discussed at the September 24, 2004 site visit at the Child Development Center for synopsis/solicitation 04-Q-0425, Carpet Installation.  The attendees were:

			
				Ms. Hebert		Contract Specialist
				Ms. McLamb		CDC Director
				Mr. Gerald		Abbey Carpet
				Mr. Grimes		Commercial Floor Covering
				Mr. Horne		Commercial Floor Covering
				Ms. Smith		Gomez Floor Covering
				Mr. Baker		Gomez Floor Covering
				Mr. Ratley		Raeford Floor & Wall
				Mr. Porter		Premiere Carpets

1)	Ms. Hebert began the meeting by giving all attendees a copy of the floor plan for building 3710, Child Development Center.  

2)	Ms. McLamb provided a tour through the facility and stressed the importance of taking all measurements quietly due to sleeping children.  She informed the attendees that carpet installation must occur after hours through the week or during specified weekend hours.  This will ensure the mission of the CDC is not disturbed.  

3)	Mr. Gerald of Abbey Carpet asked the question of rubber basing being provided for the entire room, since most rooms are only half-carpeted.  Ms. Hebert informed the group that CLIN 0002 specifies rubber basing for the entire building (approx. 1440 linear feet).  The project would not look aesthetically pleasing if only the carpeted areas were replaced.

4)	During the sample review, it was discovered that two different styles were listed on the solicitation – Spelling Bee and Bookbag.  The correct style to be referenced is Spelling Bee, Color 730.

5)	Ms. Smith asked the question of items being removed from the furnishings during installation.  Ms. McLamb responded that all items must remain on the furnishings.  She stated that her whenever her personnel move shelves around, there are no problems with the items falling off.   

6)	The question of the closing date was addressed and most vendors felt a time constraint in getting the CDC and Dining Facility proposals finished on time.  Ms. Hebert informed the group that the Dining Facility quote would be amended to 28 Sep 04 @ 1100 in order to assist with this matter. 

7)	Ms. Hebert thanked the group for attending and asked that all vendors submit their quotes in accordance with the line items listed on each solicitation.  This will expedite the evaluation process.    

8)	There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 1430.
