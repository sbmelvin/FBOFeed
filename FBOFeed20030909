<DESC>As part of the ongoing effort to clean up the U. S. Dept. of Energy’s (DOE) Hanford site in Southeastern Washington State, the environmental restoration contractor (ERC) for the DOE, Bechtel Hanford Inc., (BHI) is seeking qualified small business subcontractors to perform remedial action activities.  The activities are associated with cleanup of certain liquid waste disposal sites in the 100-NR-1 Operable Unit, near Hanford’s 100N Reactor site. Work is regulated under both CERCLA and RCRA.   The work is expected to commence in the late spring of 2004, and require 1 to 2 years to complete.  The estimated subcontract value is 3-6 million dollars.

The work involves excavating the 116-N-1 Crib and associated piping, to remove radiologically and/or chemically contaminated soil, buried miscellaneous concrete structures, large bore steel pipe and associated valves. Radiological contamination resulted primarily from wastewater flows associated with the reactor cooling system.  Chemical contamination results primarily from laboratory waste disposed of in the liquid waste disposal system.  Radiological contamination inside certain large bore piping has been measured at over 1,000 mr/hr on (external pipe) contact. A small portion of the pipe remediation will involve asbestos abatement/removal for disposal.  Contamination levels in the soil to be excavated range to 500 mr/hr on contact.  Sources of radiological contamination include plutonium, cobalt and other elements. Soils to be excavated range in size from silt to boulders. 

The contaminated materials will be loaded into 20 ton containers.  The containers will be staged and manifested for transport to Hanford’s Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF).  The work to be completed does not include the transportation to and disposal of the contaminated material at ERDF.

Earlier phases of remedial action have been completed successfully near the 116-N-1 Crib.  Previously established facilities are available for use by the successful subcontractor.  Those facilities include a large radiological survey fabric-covered structure, misc. temporary offices and meeting rooms, truck scales, a laydown and maintenance area, a haul road system, some security fencing, and limited electrical facilities and services.  

A detailed design has been previously completed for the work, and will be provided as part of the subcontract documents.  The primary pay item within the Subcontract will be lump sum excavation of contaminated material to specified lines and grade.  Optional work may include backfill of excavated waste sites. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.  The subcontractor will also be expected to have engineering and radiological control resources available.

For additional information, please contact Mr. P.T. Jewell, ptjewell@bhi-erc.com.  Prequalification is required.  For the prequalification form, go to http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm

The VA and DoD will place the awarded agent on the VA National Formulary and the DoD Basic Core Formulary as a “workhorse” fluoroquinolone for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia  (CAP), sinusitis, and other infections when clinically appropriate.  The VA and DoD will mandate that all users of oral fluoroquinolone therapy for new episodes of CAP or sinusitis be placed on the contracted agent as initial therapy, unless medical necessity warrants a different initial choice.  The VA and DoD will allow the placement of additional oral fluoroquinolone to facility formularies based on local susceptibility patterns. Indian Health Service and Bureau of Prisons may submit additional requirements, but the solicitation will clearly state whether these two agencies are included, and if so, what their additional annual usage is expected to be.  The contract period will be for a period of one year, plus four, one-year options.  Distribution will be through the VA’s and DoD’s Prime Vendor(s).  The solicitation will be available for downloading on or about Sep 17, ’03, at the VA Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management’s Internet site at http://www.va.gov/oa&mm/busopp/sols.htm.  Offers will be due on or about Oct 13, ’03.  If a hard copy of this solicitation is desired please fax your request to John Callahan, at (708) 786-5256, or e-mail request to john.callahan3@med.va.gov, and a copy will be sent to you when it issues.

STATEMENT OF WORK
AIR FORCE COMMUNITY CENTER TRAINING AND EVENT DEVELOPMENT
F8021030030300
(AS OF 5 SEPTEMBER 2003)


1.  INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

HQ USAF/ILVY is the Air Staff office charged with providing policy direction for Air Community Centers on each Air Force base.  The AF Community Centers mission is to provide activities and events serving the broad spectrum of Air Force members including active duty members and their families, Guard, Reserve, retirees and other eligible users of Air Force base programs.  Additionally, the mission statement requires that AF Community Centers coordinate and assist with base-wide, community and squadron events.  In FY00, a special event manual of four trademark events was developed for Air Force Community Centers.  The manual provides an overall strategy to accommodate the new mission and improve programming, and the design, implementation and evaluation of four unique and fun “trademark” events to help the staff accomplish the mission and turn the Community Center into the hub of activities for the individual AF installation.  All Air Force base-level Community Center directors have received on-site training at an Air Force conference on this manual in FY00, FY01 and FY03.  The consistency in event development and hands-on training has provided AF Community Centers a solid foundation to move forward with the new mission.

In accordance with the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the quote will be evaluated based on Past Performance and Price.  Past Performance is considered to be more important than Price.  
Due to the interrelationship of parts to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable.

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1 - Instruction to Offerors - Commercial
Past Performance Evaluation Standards:  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed Federal Government, State Government, Municipal Government, or commercial contracts (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offerors should provide the following information regarding past performance:

a)	Contract or purchase order number(s),
b)	Name and phone number of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government, or Commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
c)	E-mail address of point of contact (if known)
d)	Dollar value of the contract,
e)	Detailed description of the work performed,
f)	Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor(s),
g)	The number, type, and severity of any quality, delivery, or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken, and the effectiveness of the corrective action, and
          
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  If the offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state this fact.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable (or better) past performance. 

Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS) or past performance information from any source.  The evaluation will accurately summarize each telephone discussion on a Telephone Interview Report Form (Attachment 1).  A copy of the Telephone Interview Report Form will be promptly sent via fax or e-mail to the point of contact for verification.

The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of the Contract Specialist. The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.

(a)	Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality. Quality will be evaluated in terms of: 

i.	customer satisfaction, 
ii.	instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and 
iii.	evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.

(b)	Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with 

i.	performance schedules, 
ii.	timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing. 

(c)	Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to 

i.	respond to customer concerns, 
ii.	isolate and resolve problems, and
iii.	take systemic improvement action.

Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider the number and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information:

Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.

Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.

Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference. In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.

Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Oct 2000), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).

Evaluation of Price Proposal: The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.

Increasing Significance of Price:  Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based. The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.

Determination for Award to Best Value Offer:   

At the appropriate juncture in which the PCO will make a best value determination, the PCO shall engage in a best value determination in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the solicitation.  The PCO will review all of the proposals.  The PCO shall integrate the evaluation of Past Performance and Price.

Upon completion of this review, award will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered most advantageous to the Government, considering past performance and price.  The basis for the PCO’s selection will be documented in the Source Selection Decision Memorandum.  Based upon the fact that this procurement will be performed in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, the evaluation and documentation will reflect a Simplified Acquisition Procedure. 

The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.

The closing date and time for this RFQ is 24 Sep 03, 1600 hrs. Emanuel Clemons, the Contract Specialist may be contacted at 757 443-1397, for information regarding this RFQ.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with Fluke Corporation, Everett WA, for Logistical Support for the Reconfigureable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System's (RTCASS) Low Frequency Calibrator.  Logistical Support consists of engineering and technical services, Repair of Repairables (ROR) support, training, maintenance and material services.  These requirements will be procured by placing orders under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for a period of three (3) years (36 months).  At the present time, the Navy has procured a limited number of Low Frequency Calibrators that may require contractor repair services.   Due to the absence of Navy organic support for all Low Frequency Calibrator, it is imperative to procure product support services from Fluke Corp. for timely repair and turnaround.  Once the Navy organic support is achieved, these contractor support services may no longer be required.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation - only one responsible source and no other suppliers will satisfy the requirement.  At the present time, the Navy does not have complete drawing and data packages for the Low Frequency Calibrator.  In addition, all necessary logistics elements for total organic support are not in place.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals must be received within 15 days.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Biometric Research Branch (BRB), plans to procure on a sole source basis with The Math Works, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA  01760 for a MATLAB software for BRB clustering server.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541511 and the business size standard is $21M.   MATLAB is an intuitive language and a technical computing environment.  It provides core mathematics and advanced graphical tools for data analysis, visualization, and algorithm and application development.  Continuity:  Statisticians of Biometric Research Branch have been using MATLAB for years on personal PCs.  By installing MATLAB, BRB statisticians will be able to continue to have the necessary tools for advanced mathematical and computational analysis.   Compatibility, Efficiency and Processing Speed:  Large simulations need weeks or even months of CPU times on PCs.  BRB now plans to install the cluster version of MATLAB on our new Beowulf cluster.   It will permit us to run full versions of MATLAB across all of the processors and allow for parallel execution of users' simulations, thereby reducing the amount of time required for the simulations to run.  The Math Works, Inc. is the only known supplier that produces this product.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of experiments in progress.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 23, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) intends to award a sole-source procurement to Applied Minds, Inc.  NIMA has a need to procure a unique technology demonstration exhibit to be operational by 13 October 2003.  This exhibit is to incorporate some of the latest advances in Geospatial and Imagery related technology.  

The purpose of this effort is to showcase NIMA capabilities, industry partnerships, and future technology enhancements.  Work will include design and fabrication of the exhibit, transport, setup, and installation, and production of the associated multimedia demonstrations.  
Applied Minds is the only source that can perform and provide the necessary products due to their knowledge of NIMA’s Strategic Intent, previous transformation plans and initiatives such as the Corporate Transformation Business Plan, and the results of the NIMA Transformation Report produced by the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI) Enterprise Transformation Product Team (NETIPT), which was chartered in May 2002.  Further, due to previous work performed by Applied Minds, Inc. in support of other NIMA programs they possess current knowledge of NIMA’s mission, functions, business strategies, current operating construct, and understand the organization’s role with the Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense.  Some of the advanced technology to be showcased is proprietary to Applied Minds, Inc.  Having any other vendor perform these services would cause a delay of approximately six months to the government for the new contractor to develop the technical expertise comparable to Applied Minds, Inc.

This is a synopsis of intent to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. The authority for sole source procurement is FAR 6.302-1(a), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Responsible sources that are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their ability to provide the product. All responses must be e-mailed to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, Attn:  Diane Alcott, AlcottD@nima.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 16 September 2003. It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-mails have been received.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis form the University of Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), 920 S.L. Young Blvd., WP2350, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma the ability to process Cervical Tissues Collected from Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedures (LEEPS).  This project is part of the study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED)which is being conducted to identify biomarkers that would molecularly distinguish women "at risk" of progressive cervical neoplasia.  The purpose of SUCCEED is to therefore identify biomarkers that would distinguish those women who will process to cervical neoplasia from the majority that will not.  The success of the study is the ability to understnd the distinctive molecular events that occur in each cervix, comparing tumor cells to parts of the cervix that appear normal. The ability to process the LEEP as specified and maintain its topography is critical for the long-term goals of SUCCEED in understanding field effects of Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and of tumorigenesis.  LEEPS are collected from women with high grade cervical lesions and serve as the diagnostic specimen and/or treatment for the diagnosed disease.  Because the entire cervical LEEP is considered a diagnostic specimen, these tissues must be processed by OUHSC for clinical management purposes.  To filfill the long-term objectives of SUCCEED, the comprehensive processing of LEEPs is essential.  As part of the SUCCEED study, cytological specimens will also be collected on all women enrolled into SUCCEED.  The objective of this task is for the cytotechnician staining and screening of ThinPrep pap slides for pathology review at OUHSC.  Similarly, for clinical management purposes, processing of these tasks must be conducted at OUHSC.  NCI is launching SUCCED at the OUHSC in the fall of 2003.  As the clinical site for the SUCCEED project all women enrolled into the SUCCEED program will be referred to OUHSC for colposcopy or treatment.  This is not a request for compeitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabililties. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M., EDT, on September 23, 2003.  All questions should be directed to Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplfied acquisition procedures.  No collects calls will be accepted. The NAICS Code 541990.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insitute (NCI), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) plans on entering into a sole source contract with the University of Utah, 201 S. President's Circle, Room 406, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112.  The SRP directs the collection and analysis of pertinent data in order to answer key questions about cancer incidence, morbidity, mortality, and cancer-related health status in diverse regions and populations in the United States.  SRP mission manages the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, an integrated, comprehensive, populations-based cancer registry system.  The SEER Program forms the structure for studies on patterns of cancer care across the country, as well as support of pilot registries and patterns of care projects in Native American communities.  Cancer is fast becoming a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people, and there is limited data describing patterns of cancer care and treatment.  The NCI-SEER data are available on Alaska Natives and American Indians of New Mexico and other SEER sites, yet little is known about other Native populations.  Racial misclassification is one reason for inconsistent and inaccurate data.  Lack of data linkages between the Indian Health Service (IHS), state health departments, and private providers may account for the current incorporate information on cancer experiences among the AI/AN populations.  The University of Utah offers the resources of having a SEER cancer registry with a specific emphasis on Native American populations. The NCI/SRP has a need to define the patterns of cancer care, treatment, and screening among American Indian people of South Dakota as this is a fairly large population made up of several related but autonomous tribes.  In addition, the tribal members seek health care or are referred to both in-state and out-of-state private providers for cancer-related care.  As tribes are assuming increasing control and ownership of health care systems, a tremendous need exists to develop systematic cancer surveillance data that helps tribes and other providers to utilize accurate data for health care planning and interventions.  The University of Utah is the one source with the staffing to complete the patterns of care study with comparability to those of the SEER Program, perform the study among the subject populations needed to improve estimates on cancer prevention and control among racial/ethnic minority populations.  Based on the information provided, NCI has determined that the University of Utah is the only known source that can meet the above requirements.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the necessary data and or services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform the necessary requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being processed under the authority of FAR 13 simplfied acquisition procedures.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 541690.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB), plan to procure on a sole source basis services for Idealized Design of Cancer Care from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 375 Longwood Avenue, 4th Floor, Boston, MA  02215. The mission of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) is to offer resources and services to help health care organizations make dramatic and long-lasting improvements that enhance clinical outcomes and reduce costs. IHI is a unique organization that can draw on its experience, faculty, and internationally-known experts for advice in improving the quality and value of health care. The Working Group to be convened through this procurement will develop a framework for the NCI on how best to go forward on a project to redesign cancer care—the focus and types of activities that will best meet these goals.  The approach will be based on the findings of an IOM Roundtable on Health Care Quality (JAMA, September, 1998) which noted serious and widespread quality problems exist throughout American medicine.  Taking up the Roundtable’s conclusion, a subsequent landmark IOM study, Crossing the Quality Chasm, proposed that health care organizations strive for six Aims: safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.  The IHI leadership was a key member of the committee that envisioned and drafted the IOM recommendations and delineated those Aims, which form the framework for this project.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party has the resources and was involved in the IOM recommendations. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 23, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under other than full and open competition to Modular Building Concepts, 12580 Stotler Court, Poway, CA  92064 under FAR 6.302-1.  The procurement is to purchase two (2) existing leased trailers/modular buildings currently in place at US Customs and Border Protection.  The NAICS Code is 321991, SIC 2451, and the Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The trailers have been leased since 1998.

Trailer specifications are attached to this synopsis for industry information.  Any interest or pricing received as a result of this synopsis will be evaluated to include costs already expended by the Government, along with any charges for installation and setup on new trailers (FOB Destination) and dismantling and removal of existing trailers.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0002.  The purpose of this modification is to add a FAR clause, answer contractor question and establish a deadline date for all future questions.  
	FAR Clause 52.219-14 is hereby added to this Synopsis and Solicitation.
	QUESTION!!

(1) Document Type states this is a Presolicitation Notice, but Description section states "This announcement is the only solicitation."  Are we correct to assume our quotation should be submitted based solely on the contents of the current announcement?
 
(2) The Solicitation states that the vertical divergence between the 50 percent rated peak intensity points above and below the focal plane is not less than + 3 degrees.  Please verify the total vertical divergence requirement (is it + or - 3 degrees,  or  + or - 1.5 degrees for a total of 3 degrees).
 
(3) The Solicitation states "Degradation graphs of the intensity vs. duty cycle are desired."  Please clarify what is actually desired.  Are graphs showing degradation of the light intensity over time for different duty cycles desired? Or are intensity values at different duty cycles desired?
ANSWER

1.	Yes, the quote should be submitted based on the current announcement.

2.	The minimum vertical divergence should be +/- 3 degrees for a total of not less than 6 degrees.

3.  The degradation graphs of intensity vs. duty cycle should be over time.
 
September 9, 2003 at 2:00 pm will be the deadline for all questions concerning the Synopsis and Solicitation.

<CONTACT>DONALD B. ELLISON, CONTRACTING OFFICER, DESK 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095.
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that

<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an “all in one package” more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed “all-in-one” solution must meet all of the KPP’s for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APP’s are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the “double tap” feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A “double tap” feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength specification has been removed from the upcoming performance specification.  The performance specification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific wavelength; however, the visible laser system must meet the other requirements as detailed in the specification.   8b. Is class III b acceptable for high power (+100mw) mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8b:  See Performance Specification (Para.  2.1)  Tradeoffs will  be made between cost, performance, and laser safety requirements. QUESTION NO. 9:  This program is based on the SOPMOD M4 Carbine ORD.  However, Crane has established numerous other weapons as threshold weapons ( M14, M16, M249,M60, MK11, Mk 43, Mk 46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 Win Mag Sniper Rifle, M2.50 cal MG, and .50 cal Sniper rifles).  In reviewing the ORD, it would appear these other weapons are not threshold weapons. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 9:  The specification is currently under review.  We are awaiting feedback from the user community on this issue.  On 7 May 2001, USSOCOM broadened the scope of the SOPMOD Program to include all small arms organic to Special Operations Forces. QUESTION NO. 10:  With the numerous MDNS announcements, we have noted the anticipated close date as  30 AUG 02, however we are still unsure of the projected solicitation release date.   Can you please advise an estimated date accordingly or projected response time.  Given the high value of this program does the Government anticipate having a presolicitation conference? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 10  The estimated solicitation open date is 15 October 02 and the estimated solicitation close date is 15 Nov 02.  No pre-solicitation conference is planned.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification. STATEMENT OF WORK CHANGES: 1) Paragraph 3.2.4 Operator’s Manual:  Paragraph title renamed and simplified to reference MIL-PRF-63016B(TM), which is consistent with the Performance Specificataragraphs.  4) Paragraph 3.2.21 Exterior Finish:  The requirement for exterior finish was changed from flat dark gray to taupe.  Note: Product samples for the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations are exempt from this requirement.  5) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.2  Reticle:  Threshold and objective ranges were added to the ballistic compensating reticle.  6) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.4   Eye Relief:  The ECOS eye relief has been corrected to read 1.4 inches to 3.0 inches.  7) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.1.3  Weight:  The CNVD Objective Weight requirement was raised to 22 ounces.  8) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.2.1  Scope Compatibility:  The CNVD Scope compatibility table was changed to all APPs.  9) Paragraph 3.3.2.1.1.1.4 Battery Removal:  The requirement for batteries to be able to be replaced by the operator with one hand, without using tools, and without removing the MDNS subsystem from the host weapon was deleted for the VBL III.  10) Paragraph 3.4.1.3 Electromagnetic Performance Parameters:  This paragraph was improperly labeled 3.4.2.

All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as identified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem drawings.  7.

ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 43: See P erformance Specification, it describes the objective system.  QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPP’s.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPP’s are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398).  Section 108 requires contractors to electronically submit all requests for payment under DoD contracts.  This rule also requires DeCA to electronically process requests for payments and any supporting documentation.  DFARS Clause 252.232-7003 entitled Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2003) can be viewed in its entirety by using the following link:  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars/html/r20030331/252232.htm#252.232
In order to comply with the above rule, DeCA will be implementing two new software-based systems, Electronic Document Access (EDA) and Wide Area Workflow (WAWF), by October 1, 2003.
The first system, EDA, will act as a virtual (electronic) file cabinet for the storage and retrieval of contract documents used by multiple DoD activities.  EDA will replace the paper process and allow authorized user(s) access to the virtual file cabinet after completing the registration process.  For additional information, go to http://eda.ogden.disa.mil.
The second system, WAWF, is an automated system that allows vendors to electronically submit invoices and receiving reports and DeCA to inspect, accept, receive and pay electronically.  This process eliminates the time associated with mailing and processing documents.  All documentation arrives securely and on-time at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service’s (DFAS) payment office.  For additional information, go to https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil.
The Director of Finance and his staff have partnered with our agency to ensure successful implementation of the application for our DeCA vendors.  They are looking forward to working with you.  Technical questions regarding the system should be addressed to the WAWF-RA (Wide Area Workflow—Receipt and Acceptance) Customer Service Center at (800) 392-1798.

Successful implementation of EDA is essential before the benefits of WAWF can be realized.  Therefore, it is CRUCIAL that DeCA’s vendors be registered for BOTH EDA and WAWF.  

The DeCA Notice to Vendors contains information regarding necessary steps to accomplish registration.
Complete the DeCA Vendor Maintenance Form prior to CCR registration/update, EDA and WAWF-RA registration.
DUNS number(s) and CAGE code(s) are required for the EDA Access Authorization Form.
Every user of WAWF-RA must self-register on the WAWF-RA website which can be accessed at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil/servelt/selfreg

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks information related to its Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative. This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). USDA intends to assess the capabilities and then issue an RFP at a later date to those GSA contractors it determines to be the most capable. Acquisition is currently planned to begin in FY2005.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. 


BACKGROUND
USDA maintains a diverse and complex portfolio of over twenty-five financial and associated administrative systems. The Corporate Financial Management Sys-tems (CFMS) portfolio represents a corporate-wide solution for financial man-agement reform mandated by various statutes and regulations and establishes a basis for sound financial management at USDA.  In addition, the CFMS portfolio helps to ensure and produce complete, reliable, timely, and consistent financial information that lead to clean audited financial statements.  The key goal is to provide tools for program and financial managers to effectively manage and evaluate federal programs.  
At the core of the CFMS is the the Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS), the USDA corporate administrative financial information system imple-mented by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Associate Chief Fi-nancial Officer for Financial Systems (ACFO-FS). The FFIS system includes a USDA-configured version of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Federal Fi-nancial System (FFS).  The FFS vendor has already developed and is marketing its new generation of core accounting system software, and will eventually dis-continue support of the old version of FFS. Consequently, USDA must replace FFIS with a system that complies with a contemporary "open system architec-ture". The CFMS also includes the Financial Data Warehouse (FDW) and the Fi-nancial Statements Data Warehouse (FSDW), the USDA financial reporting solutions, and the two data marts, the Automated Cash Reconciliation Worksheet System (ACRWS), the FFIS Customer Service Center (CSC), and more than 15 financial and administrative “feeder” systems. The FDW and FSDW address the financial management reporting requirements in USDA. ACRWS provides criti-cal cash management and reconciliation capabilities to resolve the USDA's long-standing cash reconciliation issues. The CSC is the customer outreach to the fi-nancial management and technical communities and maintains a database of all trouble reports. 
The COTS software for FFIS was chosen in 1994 from the mandatory Financial Management System Software (FMSS) Multiple Award Schedule. COTS soft-ware is required as specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circu-lar, A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources". The implementation of FFIS serves as the corporate financial systems initiative for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to achieve compliance with the CFO Act of 1990 and provides the functionality to implement the U.S. Standard General Ledger. It also addressed the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) sys-tem requirements and the consolidated reporting requirements for financial state-ments stated in OMB Circular A-127, "Financial Management Systems."
To further improve program performance and ensure that it can meet future needs, the USDA OCF) has determined that USDA needs to obtain a new core financial management system that can meet OMB circulars A-127 and A-130 for sensitive but unclassified standard general ledger. . In particular, the OCFO is seeking to replace FFIS with a JFMIP-certified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) package, with minimal customizations, that will provide online, real-time transaction and information capability and will be accessible to the central office and all bureaus. The Corporate Financial Management System initiative to be implemented is made up of the following functional areas:
General ledger
Cash Management
Grants
Loans
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
Lockboxes
Funds management
Budget formulation
Salary Projections
Budget and performance integration
Budget planning
Budget execution
Cost management
Reporting
Treasury and Financial Management Service (FACTS 33/2108s)
OMB reporting
Agency reporting
Program reports
IRS reporting (e.g., 1099s, W02s)
Interfaces
Compliance with eGovernment initiatives (e.g., eTravel, Federal Asset Sales, Integrated Acquisition Environment, etc.)

The Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative is a complex, large-scale financial management system acquisition and implementation effort. Among other things, it will require integration with financial and administrative feeder systems, realignment of affected business processes, and clear communication to stakeholders. A successful Corporate Financial Systems Modernization will result in improved financial management reporting, accountability, and decision making throughout USDA and its agencies. It will also further USDA’s implementation of key provisions in the President’s Management Agenda, eGov requirements, and other regulatory mandates
USDA is pursuing an efficient and integrated approach that builds on government, industry, and project management best practices for acquiring a COTS financial management package and the system integration expertise to implement it. 
At its core, this approach will use a performance-based acquisition strategy that is based on effective planning and requirements gathering consistent with USDA IT policy and system development lifecycle (SDLC) guidance, and Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level 2 or higher processes. USDA plans to manage the Corporate Financial Systems Modernization using critical components of earned-value management methods for program planning, reporting, and management.


USDA Goals
Among the specific goals established for this initiative are the following:
Acquire a new core financial management system that is qualified by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP)
Provide real-time interfaces to eGovernment initiatives such as eTravel.
Ensure accuracy of reported financial data (as evidenced by unqualified audit opinions by the Office of the Inspector General for all USDA pub-lished financial statements) through the systems that prepare the state-ments
Meet EAL3 security requirements.
Satisfy the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improve-ment Act
Satisfy the requirements of the Government Management Reform Act
Proactively implement the challenges identified in the President’s Man-agement Agenda for improving overall financial management of all fed-eral agencies
Integration of financial, budget, and performance information to support decision making
Satisfy other applicable external (outside USDA) reporting requirements such as OMB circulars A127, A123 and A130
Satisfy the Secretary’s 21st Century and Competitive Workforce priorities
Provide increased analytical reporting capabilities to system users
Centralize and standardize financial management information to ensure that USDA complies with federally mandated requirements for core ac-counting and financial management and meets its business information needs.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) intends to award a purchase order to procure services for legal analysis and technical assistance to Tribal Education Departments (TEDs). This procurement is not to exceed twelve months.  The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) is responsible for the administration and oversight of programs designed to improve the educational opportunities of America's school age population, ages five through seventeen.  The Office of Indian Education (OIE), located within OESE, is responsible for implementing Title VII of the No Child Left Behind act which focuses on the education of American Indians and Alaskan Natives from preschool to graduate school.  OIE was charged by the Secretary of Education at the National Congress of American Indians conference in June 2003 to strength relationships between ED and the TEDs.   
The specific purpose of this procurement is for the contractor to assist in the analysis of the legal basis of tribal education departments and Indian education policies and to provide an evaluation of the need, potential benefits, and risks of the creation of a TED national organization. The contractor will also provide technical assistance to TEDs through facilitation of discussion meetings with OIE and legal support for tribal governments that are considering the formation of an education department or the strengthening of its existing education department.  This purchase order is intended as a sole source award to be made to the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colorado. However, all responsible sources may request a copy of the statement of work and submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Department.

Fairfax Street, Suite 210, Alexandria, VA  22314.  NIEA holds an annual conference attended by American Indian and Alaska Native tribal representatives, educators, parents and students.  The conference is attended by the largest single gathering of such participants, a majority of whom are grantees of the Office of Indian Education.  Approximately 3,000 participants are expected to attend the 2003 conference.  The Office of Indian Education is planning to conduct a total of eight (8) technical assistance workshops at the National Indian Education Association (NIEA) annual convention to be held in Greensboro, NC, from November 1 – 5, 2003.  NIEA also intends to provide time on the general assembly agenda for a presentation by the OIE Director.  The National Indian Education Association's annual convention is the only national conference targeted to Indian education programs and issues.  In preparation for the meeting, the Office of Indian Education works collaboratively with other Education Department offices and other Federal Indian Education programs to address current educational issues of local school districts and their impact on the education of Indian students.  The attendance of OIE staff and workshop presentations are highly anticipated by participants as this is often their only opportunity during the year to directly interact with OIE staff.  Participation in the conference also allows OIE an opportunity to provide technical assistance individually to grantees and disseminate information to OIE customers. The services to be provided to ED/OIE by the NIEA include: 1) Meeting space at the Joseph S. Koury Convention Center, Greensboro, North Carolina for eight workshops during the week of November 1-5, 2003; 2) Convention registration for up to nine representatives of the OIE staff; 3) Two prime exhibit booths at the convention site during the conference dates; 4) Meeting space for individual technical assistance sessions by OIE staff for grantees; 5) A full page display ad for advertising the Office of Indian Education and No Child Left Behind.

<SUBJECT>10--MINATURE DAY/NIGHT SIGHTS (MDNS)
<SOLNBR>N0016402R0014
<RESPDATE>060102
<CONTACT>Donald Ellison, Contracting Officer, 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high humidity, reduce d snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(5) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.  Group B, Activ e Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) Integrated Pointer/Illuminator Module (IPIM), (3) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (4) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) IPIM: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance/reflectivity of visible lasers against green and black targets, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the IPIM have expired.  T he SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.   B(3) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(4) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired. The SOPMOD Program desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines th is capability into a unified system, such as IPIM above. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives: (1) increased User Acceptance to include: improved operational suitability, improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 423430 with a small business size standard of 100 employees.  The requirement at FMC Rochester is for a Software/Hardware Upgrade to the existing Opus Laboratory Information System which was originally installed in October 1994.  The software is unique to the vendor since the data is maintained in a proprietary format which must be maintained in a readily retrievable format for long-term reporting and database mining.  

The upgraded laboratory information system will be used for ordering and processing lab information while maintaining compatibility with other BOP patient databases for sharing existing data.  The software must translate the current BOP custom database definitions and all clinical data utilizing current patient report structures. The upgraded laboratory information system will have the capability to process and transmit laboratory final reports and track laboratory work for FMC Rochester and other Bureau of Prison medical institutions.  Opus Healthcare Solutions is the developer and has proprietary rights to the software for the existing Lab Information System at FMC Rochester and other BOP medical institutions.  The laboratory information system has the capability of on-line entering and editing of patient demographic data and test requests, including duplicate test check for inconsistent/illogical orders with a user defined time window.  The system will allow for automatic or manual assignment of accession numbers, which will be user definable. The system will allow for specimen or aliquot labels to be printed automatically for scheduled pickups or to be printed dynamically. 

The software must be able to bi-directionally interface with the existing lab equipment which includes the Rocha Integra 800 Chemistry analyzer, Rocha Integra 400 Chemistry analyzer, Rocha Elecsys Immunoassay analyzer, and Bayer Advia 120 Hematology analyzer.  The software must convert/import the existing database into the new application with guaranteed integrity.  Additional interfaces must be readily available to support the evolving technology in the clinical lab.  The system must provide capability for real-time data extraction to allow interface with the current web-based applications at FMC Rochester.  Installation must include importing current system data into the new system.  All start up costs must be included in a proposal, to include training for laboratory staff by the vendor, on-site expenses, air fare, per diem, rental car, and accommodations for the vendor installation staff. The system is needed by October 1, 2003, because of the age of the present system.  To prevent a loss of patient data, the new system should be available immediately. The vendor staff will agree to adhere to all regulations and policies prescribed by FMC Rochester and the Bureau of Prisons during and after the installation of the laboratory information system.  The estimated system life is 7-10 years, with the inclusion of system enhancements and upgrades as they become available.

The RFQ incorporates the following provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15. FAR Provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors–Commercial Items (JULY 2003), subsection (a), (b), (f), (g), and  (j); Provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JUN 2003); Clause 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions–Commercial Items (FEB 2002); Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders–Commercial Items (JUN 2003), subsection (b)1,3,7,10,13-19 and 30 applies; Clause 52.228-5 Insurance - Work On A Government Installation (JAN 1997); Clause 52.237-2 Protection Of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (APR 1984).

The final determination and completion of the security investigation procedures will be made at the sole discretion of FMC Rochester.  Once a contractor employee clears the initial screening requirements, a urinalysis test will be required before the individual is allowed access into the institution.  If the results of the urinalysis test are positive, that individual will be disqualified from performing under the contract.  If the individual clears both the initial screening requirements and the urinalysis test, that individual will be issued a pass for access into the institution.  Contractor employees shall adhere to all institution regulations regarding conduct and performance. Contractor employees will be allowed access to the institution at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Any individual performing under this contract may be removed if it becomes apparent that his or her conduct does not reflect the conduct of that prescribed for those people performing under non-personal service contracts.

The contract will require contract staff to access a system of medical records which will require adherence to the Privacy Act of 1974.  The system of records will be maintained in accordance with community standards for medical records.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)- CONTROLLED CORRESPONDENCE TRACKING SYSTEM.  
The SBA wishes to transform its business processes by investigating options for implementing an integrated, web-based software package to support real-time correspondence control tracking.  

Background:  

The US Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Executive Secretariat’s Office (ES) is currently responsible for assigning, controlling, and tracking inquiries and correspondence coming into SBA from the public, members of Congress, the White House, other government agencies, SBA partners, and various associated offices.  In the course of a single year, SBA receives an average of 4600+ letters and inquiries that the ES is responsible for tracking.  In addition to tracking incoming correspondence, SBA needs to track its responses.  In the latter part of 1999, SBA’s ES office piloted the use of a customized database-tracking system to handle their correspondence tracking requirements.  Under that system, when a piece of correspondence enters the agency, it is scanned and logged into the system, creating an electronic Correspondence Assignment Folder.  The Folder is given a unique control number (based on date and sequence) and an appropriate due date (if required).  Users can then access the Folder in the system in order to add, update, and review any of its documents.  The pre-defined workflow moves the Folder to the subsequent assignment or step in the process.  For example, the system denotes which office should prepare a response, the level of the official who should sign it, and the offices that should be provided copies.  Historical data about the Correspondence Folder and the associated workflow can be viewed through user-friendly searches and customized reports.  The current system, however, is not sufficient to accomplish the objectives that ES has now established.  First, limited funding for the original pilot system resulted in the procurement of only 325 user licenses, which has caused only a partial use of the application and only a partial solution to the correspondence tracking issue.  Because only a couple of people per office have access to the system, along with the fact that no secure signature function exists for clearance, the system accomplishes only half of ES‘s objectives.  Although the tracking system is used to create an electronic record of correspondence, assign the appropriate response to the appropriate office, and archive final responses, it is not used in the vast majority of the clearance process.  Therefore, the approach does not fully achieve SBA’s or the Government’s goal of efficiently streamlining our workflow processes and creating an agency-wide paperless environment.  

Required Solution:  

A Control Correspondence Tracking System (CCTS) to track each and every piece of correspondence and other internal documents that come in or go out of SBA through ES and/or other program and field offices. This new system must include the following characteristics:  
•	A fully electronic clearance process, both within drafting offices (internal) and with other offices in the agency (external).  
•	Clearances process should have secure method to record and confirm clearances from individuals, such as an actual digital image of a signature or a secure electronic history.  Whatever the vehicle is that is used to achieve this, it must be password-protected.  
•	Clearance process must allow simultaneous collaboration and revisions by different offices/users on documents that require action from multiple offices.  
•	Must include a user-definable workflow for the clearance process so that drafting offices or ES can modify the clearance sequence on a case-by-case basis.  The sequence may vary back and forth between sequential and simultaneous, depending on the document.  For instance, a document drafted in a program office might need to be cleared by the appropriate (sub-)office director, then sent to the drafting office’s top official, then to his supervisor, then sent simultaneously out to two other program offices and the General Counsel’s office, then to Congressional Affairs, and finally to ES.  
•	All files (incoming, edits/clearances, and signed final) should be stored electronically, so there is no need to keep any hard copies for files.  
•	Easy to use system that will require minimal training (common sense, logical applications) and minimal maintenance.  
•	Must seamlessly integrate into SBA’s Microsoft (MS) Windows and Office desktop environment.  The system should also recognize and use SBA’s user log-in (MS Windows 2000) for all applications.  
•	Software system that is flexible so that changes/updates can be made easily – as much as possible, by SBA OCIO staff at HQ (rather than by vendors).  
•	Must include an Out-of-Office Assistant function, just like in MS Outlook email: any individual who will be out of the office will be responsible for turning message on and leaving clear instructions as to back-ups; message would be sent back to drafter to let him/her know and reassign accordingly (rather than being automatically forwarded to one or more default backups).  

Conclusion:  

The desired end result is a system that can handle the digital tracking, archiving, indexing, and retrieval of all correspondence components and actions.  This system will also serve as a strategic step towards SBA's goal of complying with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) and towards implementing an agency-wide electronic document management capability.  

Submittals:  

You are requested to submit information on any COTS or MOTS solution that fulfills the stated criteria, along with a general cost estimate.  The information should be submitted to SBA at the address indicated herein, attention Sharon A. Gurley, Office of Procurement & Grants Management.  Any questions regarding this RFI should be submitted in writing (e-mail will suffice).  All information is due by no later than 9/22/03 at 4:00pm.

<SUBJECT>G -- RPCV Clarification to Q&A#5
<DESC>Regarding the 04 SEP 2003 Q&A to combine solicitation number PC-03-R-003 ("Returned Peace Corps Volunteers Health Insurance Program"); please be advised of the following clarifications to the reply to Q5 ("Please provide the RPCV Health Insurance Program Claims experience per year for the past three (3) years"): (1) The paid claims DO NOT have IBNR (Incurred But Not Loaded) into them. This term represents claims that are occurring at the present time but that have not been submitted to date. IBNR is commonly factored into the loss ratio but that is not the case with the current plan. (2) The Policy Year reporting method, which is the method used in the data previously reported, matches the earned premium for a Volunteer to the claims paid out for that Volunteer in the year of COS (Close of Service) and is the most accurate way to state the loss ratio. (3) The 36 months tail allows for all the premium possible for that COS year to be matched with all the paid claims possible for that same COS year. Note that Year 3, 4, and 5 need more time to fully develop.  DUE TO THIS CLARIFICATION AND TO ENCOURAGE COMPETITION FOR THIS REQUIREMENT, THE DATE AND TIME FOR SUBMISSION OF OFFERS IS HEREBY EXTENDED FIFTEEN (15) CALENDAR DAYS TO NOON (12PM LOCAL WASHINGTON DC TIME) ON FRIDAY, 03 OCT 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- Quantum Logic for Trapped-Ion Optical Clocks
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado - Boulder, Physics Department (Dr. Neil Ashby, PI) to carry out experiments on trapped-ion optical clocks that incorporate elementary quantum information processing. ***  Over the past few years, NIST has initiated a program in quantum information processing.  The Ion Storage Group of the Time and Frequency Divison has demonstrated all of the basic elements of quantum computation with the system of trapped atomic ions.  During the course of this work, other applications of quantum information processing have emerged.  In particular, using the basic elements of quantum logic, it should be possible to realize an atomic clock with performance surpassing that of any existing atomic clock.  Based upon close contacts with all groups in the world that perform this type of work,  the Ion Storage Group believes that Dr. Ashby and his colleagues are unique in possessing the required skills in both trapped-ion quantum information processing and laser stabilization.  Further, the NIST facilities in Boulder are world-class and could not be duplicated elsewhere in a reasonable time or at a reasonable cost. ***  Work will include the following tasks: (1) Construct and set up ion trap apparatus for the simultaneous storage of A1+ and Be+ ions; (2) build dye laser system for 626 nm light; (3) Build frequency doubler to convert 626 nm light to 313 nm for cooling/detection of Be+ ions; (4) perform laser cooling experiments that use a single Be+ ion to sympathetically cool a simultaneously stored A1+ ion; (5) set up CW dye laser at 534 nm and frequency lock to existing stable reference cavities; and (6) set up frequency doubling system to convert 534 nm light to 267 nm. ***   This small purchase acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.1.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than September 25, 2003 and will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement process will be in the Government's best interest.  FAR provisions in full text are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Inquiries or responses should be submitted in writing to Michelle Sandoval, Purchasing Agent, via email at Michelle.Sandoval@noaa.gov or by fax at (303) 497-3163.  The anticipated award date is October 1, 2003.

INVENTION SUMMARY:

BBWI’s nuclear material detection system uses an IBM-compatible computer, associated commercial electronics, and a pulsed photonuclear neutron detector (PPND).  The PPND weighs approximately 16 kg and has been designed for detection of 0.1-keV to 1.0-MeV neutrons.  The latter range is representative of many delayed fission neutron emissions.  A preamplifier, located within the detector, has been specifically designed to operate within intense pulsed, photon-flash environments.  Detector shielding design has been chosen to maintain a very low sensitivity to voluminous room-return, low-energy neutrons associated with active interrogation environments.  With energy selectivity, total passive detection efficiency is approximately 3 ´ 10–4 counts per californium-252 (252Cf) source fission neutron at 100 centimeters.  With this detection efficiency, PPND performs quite well and supports both passive and active detection applications.  Each detector uses a small, internal 12-V power supply to provide the high voltage to the 3He tube.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. BAQ030055 is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-6. This solicitation provided for full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  is 111998 All Other Miscellaneous Crop Farming, or Standard Industrial Classification Code (SIC) 0191 Grass Seed Farming or General combination crop farming. (1) REQUIREMENT: The Bureau of Land Management, Bakersfield Field Office, Bakersfield, CA has a requirement for collection of native forb, shrub and grass seed from the vicinity of the Atwell Island Land Retirement Project Area. The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will work with the contractor to identify plant species to collect, locations to collect the species, and the amount of seed needed of each species.  The contractor will collect, process, and deliver the seed to the BLM, Bakersfield Field Office.  Processing will consist of screening the seed to remove non-seed material to the point that the seed will pass through a Truax Range Drill, an Imprinter seeder, or a broadcast seeder.  The contractor will provide the management of the field crews and expertise on the best way to collect and clean each species of seed.  The collector will first check the seed using standard field methods to be sure that it has the potential for being viable (i.e. current year's seed, not dried and shriveled seed from previous years).  Bid should be made based on hand collection of seed.  Mechanical collection may be allowed during the actual collection, but will be discussed and approved on a location by location and species by species basis.  After the seed is collected, the collector will submit the seed to a seed-testing lab specified by COR for a TZ potential germination test.  All seed testing lab results will be submitted to the COR. The contract will be awarded based on the average price* of 19 potential native plant species for collection.  (This is not the entire list of what will be collected under the contract).  Prices for seed not shown on this list, but which BLM wishes to collect, will be negotiated at the time of request. A. Commercially grown-out seed is not acceptable under this contract.  The bid price will be based on seed that has been processed to the point that it will pass through a Truax Range Drill, an Imprinter, or a broadcast seeder.  All sticks, rocks, and other rough material will be removed.  Seed heads will be broken up to the point that individual seeds will be planted (not the whole seed head).

Background

The end of the 20th Century was a time of increased technological and societal change for the transportation planning community.  Innovations such as the use of GIS, GPS, remote sensing, mobile phones, internet mapping and surveying, have provided the transportation professional, industry and the general public a potential overwhelming wealth of information about personal travel, goods movement and system performance.  While rapid change in the field of transportation is not unprecedented, the increase in information and ability to analyze and display information may be.

At the same time, understanding and responding to the transportation needs has become greater and more complex.  The transportation system in the United States continues to serve an increasing population and even faster increase in vehicle travel.  More areas have become urbanized and some of the faster growing areas are in the smaller urban areas.  Both personal trips and good movements are more diverse in origin and destination, time of day and purpose.  The transportation system that will meet these increasing needs is aging.  At the same time, there is increasing consideration of other societal goals in the development of transportation programs from promoting environmental stewardship to incorporating local community context.

The role of transportation planning is changing to emphasize the movement of people and goods as well as environmental, social, economic, land development, and financial parameters of alternative futures. FHWA is being asked to assist the transportation community in addressing issues related to land development, economics, equity, congestion, and sustainability among others, within a transportation schema. This is reflected in the FHWA research agenda – crosscutting and multi-disciplinary in response to the issues facing planners today.

Within this context, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the likely forthcoming re-authorization for surface transportation and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) charge FHWA and transportation planning at all levels of government with meeting the complex demands of identifying and responding to future transportation needs. In particular, ISTEA and TEA-21 promote the assessment of multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making. Furthermore, the breadth of ISTEA and TEA-21 energized the role of the FHWA in providing support to the transportation planning community. 

Because of this, the research universe the FHWA operates in is fluid, dynamic, and flexible. To realize its research, development and technical assistance objectives, FHWA is seeking the support and cooperation of multi-disciplined research partners to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.  The ability to bring in specialists in various fields, including those outside traditional transportation disciplines, is of greater significance today than at any other time. The ability to retain flexible and responsive support, available at any time to research, assist, and answer the questions related to planning for a world class transportation system is of utmost importance. 

Purpose

The purpose of this solicitation for FHWA is three fold:

·To develop innovative approaches for providing improving transportation planning and decision-making;

·To identify and test new channels of disseminating information and expertise; and

·To develop and build on successful research partnerships

Transportation Planning Research Topic Areas

The research will be targeted at specific needs and areas of interest that will support FHWA work in Planning Capacity Building as well as innovation in transportation planning process and decision-making, transportation and land use and transportation and community impacts.

Topic Area #1: Transportation Planning in Large Cities 

Summary of Topic Area – Very large central cities (cities with around or over one million population) have unique transportation issues.  Very large cities and their infrastructure, both public and private, have high recognition in the United States and throughout the world as international gateways and destinations to people and goods that travel to the United States.  As such they play an important role in the economic and cultural health and prestige of the country.

Very large cities have high levels of congestion and delay in their transportation system as well as high levels of transportation system redundancy.  In many cases they operate and manage legacy systems that no longer reliably serve contemporary transportation needs.  The ability to plan and shape growth in very large cities is constrained by their very size, intensity of development and dramatic histories.  The cost to plan and program transportation needs in very large cities and respond to the transportation and potentially competing public policy needs are immense.  Many large cities have strong capacity, depth and resilience in both the government agencies and community-based and special interest organizations to assess and debate transportation needs.  Accordingly, their planning needs are both complex and different in scale and substance from other jurisdictions in some metropolitan areas or from State, regional and local entities in other areas.

Past studies focusing on transportation planning in very large cities have touched on themes including inter-jurisdictional coordination for traffic management, planning for pedestrians in large cities, and intermodal transportation links.

Examples of Research Projects in Topic Area #1, Transportation Planning in Large Cities:

·The research partner may conduct research looking at inter-jurisdictional coordination within the metropolitan area and between large cities and State Departments of Transportation; and
·The research partner may conduct research on integration of and consideration for diverse and emerging public policies (such as infrastructure lifecycle management, system operation, community cohesion or policies supporting context sensitive solutions/ context sensitive design) within the transportation planning process.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may test methods for promoting and supporting key policy networks for large cities in the field of transportation policy and management;
·The research partner may have facilities that can provide multimedia support for conferences, peer roundtables, workshops, education and training; and
·The research partner may test new methods for dissemination of original and other research using relevant publications and professional networks.

Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in this Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate the ability to facilitate a dialogue among the cities over one million in population and peer cities; 
·The research partner should demonstrate an understanding of complexity and variety of inter-jurisdictional relationships for large cities throughout the United States; and
·The research partner should demonstrate the ability to comprehend and summarize complex transportation issues in plain English for non-academic audiences.

Topic Area #2: Transportation Planning for Rural Areas and Small Communities

Summary of Topic Area: With constant changes in the field of transportation planning, it is increasingly important to ensure that transportation professionals and decision-makers located in the rural areas and small communities have access to tools and techniques developed for their unique needs and capacities.  There are over 2,000 non-metropolitan Counties and hundreds of regional development districts outside of metropolitan areas in the United States.  The transportation professionals and decision-makers frequently work in small and remote agencies so have less day-to-day contact with their peers to master the latest planning tools and techniques.  They may not have the time, budget or staff to attend training or workshops on innovative planning tools.  At the same time, a single transportation project in these areas may have considerable and long-lasting implications on the economic and social well being of the area.  Accordingly, it is important that the professionals and decision-makers have the best available information about transportation needs and options so they can participate in the Statewide transportation planning process.

Past research in this planning research focus area has included applying readily available data and analysis tools for understanding transportation needs, review of inter-governmental processes and identification of centers of support for rural and small community planning.

Examples of Research Projects in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner may conduct research on innovative techniques for providing remote training to professionals and decision-makers on the transportation planning process; 
·The research partner may conduct research identifying illustrative examples of innovative transportation planning practice in rural areas and small communities; 
·The research partner may synthesize information on emerging and current transportation issues facing rural communities in the 21st Century;
·The research partner may conduct research on evaluating and promoting innovative and measurable methods of dissemination to rural and small community audiences on transportation planning; and
·The research partner may assess methods for strengthening the capacity of non-metropolitan local officials on issues such as growth management that balances environmental, economic, and community concerns through community-driven solutions, preservation of local identity, and safeguarding natural and cultural resources.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may pilot education and training opportunities for community, economic and rural development practitioners and policymakers;
·The research partner may test programs and publications for helping bridge the communication gap among citizens, practitioners, researchers and policymakers;
·The research partner may provide then evaluate innovative products that support and enhance the administration of county government in the United States on transportation planning;
·The research partner may conduct formal feedback and evaluation of county governments and non-metropolitan development agencies on transportation program research needs; and
·The research partner may test new concepts for operating a clearinghouse of technical assistance and information for county officials and other interested groups.


Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in this Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate knowledge of multi-modal transportation planning;
·The research partner should demonstrate ability to assess transportation needs in rural areas and in small communities;
·The research partner should demonstrate the ability to facilitate the input and involvement of rural local officials in the planning and programming process both in meetings and through electronic networks; 
·The research partner should demonstrate experience promoting peer networking and learning opportunities; 
·The research partner should demonstrate experience with public-private partnerships and innovative ways of working together on issues such as the environment, sustainable communities and balancing local context with regional or Statewide needs.

Topic Area #3: Inter-relationships between Transportation, Land Use and Markets

Summary of Topic Area: The purpose of this focus area is to investigate and evaluate the theory and practice of integrating transportation and land use policy.  The research is intended to improve the quality of debate and disseminate knowledge of critical issues in transportation and land policy by bringing together scholars, policy makers, practitioners and citizens with diverse backgrounds and experience. It is important in the exchange of insights and working toward a broader understanding of complex transportation, land use and infrastructure policies, that the research partner does not take a particular point of view, but rather serves as a catalyst to facilitate analysis and discussion of these issues to make a difference today and to help policy makers plan for tomorrow.

Example of Research Projects in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner may explore, identify or document innovative examples of how decision-makers weigh transportation, land use and economics together.

Examples of Product Proof of Concept/Testing and Innovative Processes:

·The FHWA research partner may pilot executive courses where participants have the opportunity to exchange ideas with scholars and practitioners who have used or developed the latest land policy tools and techniques;
·The research partner may pilot professional development courses designed to assist the participants in developing useful skills and tools for their professional work;
·The research partner may test workshops, peer roundtables or other activity formats that provide participants with original insights and up-to-date information and unique opportunities for sharing and learning with peers and colleagues, and invaluable lessons that will assist the participants in their work; and
·The research partner may develop publications that evaluate the above training so that the results may be shared with non-participants.

Specific Examples of Expertise for Success in the Topic Area:

·The FHWA research partner should demonstrate both an academic and practitioner understanding of the policy issues surrounding transportation and land use;
·The research partner should demonstrate high ability to provide a valuable learning environment to both advanced practitioners, transportation agency executives and elected and appointed decision-makers; and
·The research partner should demonstrate peer-recognized expertise on issues such as urban and regional planning and design, land conservation, the reuse of urban land, and the behavior of land and real estate markets in relationship to transportation investments, the relationship between urban and environmental systems; the planning process and its outcomes, the interplay of public and private roles in decisions in planning and investment while being conversant in the variations and differences in authority and context for decisions in different parts of the United States.
