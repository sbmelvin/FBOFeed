<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Advertising Council (Ad Council) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (unique source) for a 3-year contract for a Patient Safety Public Service Announcement Campaign.  AHRQ is the lead Federal Agency charged with supporting research designed to improve quality of health care, reduce its cost, address patient safety and medical errors, and broaden access to health care.  AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that provides evidence-based information that helps policymakers, health care administrators, clinicians, patients, and other health care makers make more informed decisions.  This contract will provide assistance to AHRQ with the following tasks:  (1) develop a donated public service campaign strategy to include a theme message, target audience definition and recommended media placement; (2) create and produce appropriate multimedia products supporting the strategy; (3) disseminate these products to national media outlets and use best efforts to encourage their use as Public Service Announcements (PSA’s); and (4) monitor and periodically report on the results of the dissemination effort.  It is AHRQ’s intent to award this contract to the Ad Council as they are uniquely qualified to meet the requirements of this project.  The Ad Council is a non-profit organization established in 1942 for the express purpose of providing public service advertising expertise for the federal government and other national non-profit organizations.  The Ad Council invented the concept of the public service announcement campaign as a mechanism to promote the education and well-being of the American people.  The Ad Council is the unique organization designated by the advertising industry to present its public service work in the United States.  There is no other known source offering the full range of public service campaign services nationwide. Contingent upon a successful negotiation, it is AHRQ’s intent to award a contract to the Ad Council.  The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  For this requirement, sources must exhibit an understanding of the goals and mission of AHRQ and the fields of television and radio PSA campaigns.  They must have an understanding of and experience in PSA development and distribution and knowledge of public health.  Sources must also possess the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities, such as planning, dissemination and distribution of television PSA production and distribution, radio PSA production and distribution, newspaper and magazine ad production and distribution, research, talent recruitment, vendor fulfillment, creative design, materials development, promotion and presentation and Web site design.  The qualification of potential sources include experience in providing public service advertising expertise for the Federal Government and other national non-profit organizations.  They should have a clear concept of a public service announcement campaign as a mechanism to promote the education and well-being of the American people, with expertise in the advertising industry to present its public service work in the United States.  Sources must be capable of offering the full range of PSA campaign services nationwide with demonstrated leadership and creative oversight to ensure the continuing quality and acceptance of products and services, to include a high level of industry-wide buy-in and support, both of which are critical factors in the successful placement of public service announcement materials. Interested organizations capable of performing the above, and with the requisite qualifications and expertise, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above no later than June 23, 2005.  No solicitation document is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at swilliam@ahrq.gov. or hard copies (original and two copies) may be sent to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850.  Capability statements received after June 23, 2005, will not be reviewed.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with International Severity Information Systems, Inc. (ISIS), 699 East South Temple, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, UT 84102-1282, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (unique source).  The purposes of this 21-month contract are to (1) implement a quality change strategy developed in “Real Time Optimal Care Plans for Nursing Home QI” grant (U118 HS13696) funded by AHRQ in at least 30 nursing homes working through Quality Improvement Organizations and (2) track impact on the rate of pressure ulcers acquired by high risk residents and efficiencies in form consolidation and quality reporting.  The real time project is an evidence-based, pressure ulcer prevention, quality improvement program that consolidates and standardizes quality data elements, embeds evidence-based processes into the daily work flow of nurses and nurse aides in nursing homes, and provides on-time clinical decision support for nurse aides and professional nurses in nursing homes.  This quality improvement strategy was developed by ISIS under a grant funded by AHRQ (U18 HS13696).  Because the intent of this contract is to transfer the skills acquired from the “real time” grant, ISIS is the only possible contractor because of its unique qualifications and expertise developed from designing this intervention and their experience of implementing it with 11 nursing homes.  They have shown that nursing homes participating are better able to prevent pressure ulcers from occurring once the elements of the intervention are in place.  They also possess unique expertise and extensive clinical and analytic experience in implementing and evaluating quality improvement projects in long term care.  Contingent upon a successful negotiation, it is DHHS’s intent to award a contract to ISIS.  The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  For this requirement, at a minimum, key personnel should have at least 1 year of experience in long term care quality change project management and experience interacting with Quality Improvement Organizations and other nursing home stakeholders in developing and implementing a clinical decision support system for nursing home staff and specific experience with the quality improvement model used in the AHRQ project funded as AHRQ Grant #U18 HS13696.  Qualified offerors must demonstrate their understanding of the role of workflow redesign and decision support in improving quality of care in nursing homes.  In addition, they must have the ability to demonstrate their knowledge of the evidence for pressure ulcer prevention.  Interested organizations capable of performing similar services, and with the requisite qualifications and expertise, should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above no later than June 23, 2005.  No solicitation document is currently available.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at swilliam@ahrq.gov. or hard copies (original and two copies) can be mailed to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Reserach and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850.

<DESC>The 50th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for: The Predator 7000, Advanced Entry Control System (AECS) with spare equipment and parts to Diebold Incorporated, 5995 Mayfair Road, Canton, OH 44707-8077. This equipment will be used to update the base security control system. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the Predator 7000 (AECS) being installed is proprietary to Diebold Inc. Diebold manufactures the requested list of spare parts and equipment for their AECS security equipment. No other security system could be identified that could be adapted to the base's existing security control system. The items supplied by Diebold are the only items that have full compatibility. Questions should be directed to TSgt John Trippe in writing via email: John.Trippe@Schriever.af.mil… or by facsimile: (719) 567-3438.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s (GSA) Lease No. GS-05B-14598 expires in the near future.  The lease covers 1517 usable square feet of office and related space in a class A office building and 15 surface parking spaces in Olney, Illinois.  GSA is interested in considering alternate space if economically advantageous to the Government.  In determining whether relocation would be economically advantageous to the Government, GSA will consider coast factors including but not limited to the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs ( whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and the anticipated rent for the space, as well as other factors impacting the Government’s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that might be required at an alternate location, the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term.  Persons interested in providing space to the Government who believe they can do so at terms more favorable than those contained in a succeeding lease should contact Tina Church at (312)353-5068.

<DESC>LRO RF Communications Reference Baseline			dated June 2, 2005 This document is intended to inform interested vendors of the current baseline architecture for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission communication system.  This document describes the current project understanding of LRO’s mission communications as a result of the project’s previous RFI process.  This is not a request for additional RFI responses, nor is this a request for vendor proposals.	No procurement action will be taken as a result of this document’s release. The LRO Project intends to initiate three separate competed procurement efforts to acquire the flight components for the LRO Spacecraft Communication System.  These procurements will consist of the S-Band TT&C Transponder, the High-Rate Ka-Band Modulator, and the Ka-Band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA).  LRO shall provide tracking, telemetry and command functions using S-Band.  LRO shall provide high rate mission data return at Ka-band.  At a minimum, LRO will perform a 30 minute TT&C pass every lunar orbit (approximately every 2 hours).  LRO will perform up to 4 high rate Ka-band downlinks in a 24 hour period.  The high rate downlinks may be adjacent passes. S-Band TT&C Subsystem LRO’s S-Band TT&C subsystem architecture consists of a STDN transponder and associated diplexer, switches and RF network to connect the transponder to the omnidirectional and high gain antennas.  Command decryption (if required) can be accommodated internal to the transponder, or through the use of a standalone command decryptor in-line between the transponder receiver and the S-Band comm. card in the C&DH processor.  The transponder shall provide the following modes: Transponder Characteristics: Downlink data:		RS-422 CLK and DATA Uplink data:		RS-422 CLK and DATA Control/Status: 	RS-422 serial UART interface RF Output:		S-Band 5W Command Uplink (Ground to LRO) Frequency Band: 	2.025 - 2.11 GHz Command Modulation:	PCM/PSK/PM Command Subcarrier:	16 KHz Command Data Rate:	4 Kbps Command Link FEC:	(none) Command Decryption:	Caribou assumed Tracking:		STDN tones, baseband modulated 			Simultaneous with CMD 			Highest ranging tone will be 500 KHz Telemetry Downlink (Subcarrier Modulated Mode) (LRO to Ground) Frequency Band: 	2.2 – 2.29 GHz Telemetry Modulation:	PCM/PSK/PM Telemetry Subcarrier:	1.024 MHz Telemetry Data Rates:	16Kbps (36.64 K-symbols/sec) 			32Kbps (73.28 K-symbols/sec) 			64Kbps (146.56 K-symbols/sec) 			128Kbps (293.12 K-symbols/sec) Downlink FEC:		CCSDS Reed-Solomon & Convolutional Rate ½ Downlink Encryption:	(none) Tracking:		STDN tones, baseband modulated 			Simultaneous with TLM 			Highest ranging tone will be 500 KHz Telemetry Downlink (Direct Modulated Mode) (LRO to Ground) Frequency Band: 	2.2 – 2.29 GHz Telemetry Modulation:	OQPSK (direct carrier) Telemetry Subcarrier:	(none) Telemetry Data Rates:	300Kbps  (687 K-symbols/sec) 			2180Kbps (4992.2 K-symbols/sec) 			5000Kbps (no FEC) Downlink FEC:		CCSDS Reed-Solomon & Rate ½ (2.29x	       			    multiplier) Downlink Encryption:	(none) Tracking:		(none) Ka-Band Mission Data Subsystem LRO’s Ka-band subsystem consists of a high rate Ka-band modulator, TWTA, EPC, and the RF network between the TWTA and LRO’s high gain antenna.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, gov! ernment contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect ! their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Cont! ract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B.

No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award.

Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Nautronix Maripro, Inc. of Goleta, CA for procurement of  Hydro Acoustic Information Link (HAIL) acoustic communications support to Naval Special Warfare Craft.  The HAIL system is an acoustic approach for undersea communications provided by Nautronix PLC (the Australian parent company of Nautronix Maripro Inc).  HAIL has been fielded by the Royal Australian Navy in Collins-class submarines and is undergoing foreign comparative testing in US Submarines.  Recent events accelerated interest within Naval Special Warfare for potential HAIL communications between US submarines and Special Operations Forces.   Therefore, NSWC PC has been asked to coordinate HAIL-related RDT&E efforts for certain Naval Special Warfare craft.  This effort will require contracted assistance from activities possessing detailed knowledge of the HAIL ! system.  The anticipated support  is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Nautronix, PLC and their US subsidiary, Nautronix Maripro Inc., possess unique and proprietary knowledge of the HAIL system.  Nautronix is also the sole contractual source for information regarding interface with US Navy submarines under foreign comparative testing.  Therefore, Nautronix is the only company capable of supporting integration of HAIL software and hardware for Naval Special Warfare craft.  Given these facts, Nautronix is uniquely qualified to provide the required communication system. The anticipated award date will be on or about June 30, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Period of performance will be 90 days from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 541511.  Size Standard is $21M.  FSC 6320.

For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 05 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 74.85% to SB, 15.6% to SDB, 13.92% to WOSB, 1.17% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NIINDS), Cellular Neurology Unit (CNP), plans to procure of a sole source basis, services for Custom Gene Targeting Generation of Maspardin and Spartin Knock-Out Mice with Xenogen Biosciences, Inc., 5 Cedar Brook Drive, Cranbury, NJ  08512.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement has been set aside for small business. The procurement will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13. The Cellular Neurology Unit is engaged in research that aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of a class of neurological disorders known as the hereditary spastic paraplegias.  Animal models for these disorders, particularly in rodents, are valuable tools that will help NINDS to accomplish these research aims.  This procurement is associated with the generation of mouse models for two forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, SPG20 and SPG21, for which no animal models currently exist.  The technology for the generation and analysis of these mice is covered under multiple patents including US Patent 5,464,764, 5,650,135, 	6,217,847, 5,583,024, 5,674,713, 5,700,673, and 5,670,356, and is available solely from the proposed contractor.  NINDS program goals already met include a basic understanding of the gene products that are mutated in patients with the hereditary spastic paraplegia types SPG20 and SPG21, spartin and maspardin, respectively.  Generation of the animal models in this proposed action are crucial to understanding	better the pathogenesis of these disorders, as well as to test potential therapeutic options.  It is essential that NINDS use the proposed methodology for generation of the knock out mice for our research.  Xenogen Biosciences is the only source known that utilizes the methods required for the NINDS research as they are covered under multiple US Patents as described above, and are not available from other sources. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the research already in progress.   This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on June 24, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft Contract Specialist, at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aeronomy Laboratory (AL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Envair/Aerochem (George M. Hidy, Principal), 6 Evergreen Drive, Placitas, NM 87043 to provide planning and to develop analysis and assessment programs in support of NARSTO. Formerly an acronym for "North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone," the term NARSTO has become simply a wordmark signifying this tri-national, public-private partnership for dealing with multiple features of tropospheric pollution, including ozone and suspended particulate matter. Envair and Dr. Hidy will provide support to the NARSTO Management Coordinator on the NARSTO Emissions Inventory Assessment and through preparation of a synthesis paper on global-scale aerosols and a concept paper addressing a management strategy for developing a “one-atmosphere” approach to air quality management in North America. In addition, Dr. Hidy will undertake additional independent studies of important tropospheric chemistry issues relevant to NARSTO’s mission. As a long-standing co-chair of NARSTO’s Analysis and Assessment Team, Dr. Hidy is uniquely qualified to support the NARSTO Management Coordinator, due to his in-depth knowledge of NARSTO activities and priorities and his work on previous NARSTO state-of-science assessments, including ozone and particulate matter (PM). This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date will be June 29, 2005.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), intends to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with Beckman Coulter, Inc., 4300 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92835 for a Multisizer 3 Particle & Cell Counter and Sizing Analyzer, part no. 6605697; pcb ethernet interface, part no. 8321317; aperture concentrate control, part no. 177495; standard, cc mixed kit, part no. 6601329; and installation/training.   This will be used for differential cell counting of cells generated by pulmonary lavage, cells grown in culture or cells isolated from tissue.  Each cell suspension requires a unique fluid media to support it.  This instrument is capable of counting any cells which have been diluted into the proprietary diluant, Isoton II.  It is this flexibility of allowing for the counting of various cell types, regardless of the media in which they are in, to be counted, which makes this instrument needed for NIOSH’s laboratory research.  This is not a request for quotations and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the equipment should identify themselves and give written qualification/capabilities to provide a product with comparable functionality.  This information must be submitted to the Contracting Officer with 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis.  Reference #000HCC33-2005-21861.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to jmh8@cdc.gov or by fax to Jenny Bayer @ (513)533-8283.

<DESC>Install Automated Power Factor Correction System T-624 at Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal.  The project is to  provide all labor, tools, materials, equipment, components, software and engineering services to perform the following work.  Design, provide and install an automatically controlled power factor correction system for the Lajes Field 6.9 KV bus in Power Plant T-624, the system design shall be based on not less than two weeks of charting the Lajes Field electrical load.  The contractor shall perform the charting or arrange for charting by the local utility.  Provide shop drawings, working schematic and description of operation for review.
The system shall be capacitor based in approximately six steps.  The necessary MVAR is estimated at 1.0 to 1.5 MVAR per bus.  The contractor shall verify the necessary MVAR rating.  The system shall include the necessary de-tuned inductors to filter 5th, 7th and other significant harmonic components as determined by charting.  The system shall provide a power factor of at least 0.93 as seen by the local utility at a voltage of no less than 6.9 KV on the Lajes Field Power Plant bus.  The system shall provide power factor correction for both A and B busses in the open bus mode and for single bus operation with A and B connected through bus ties as one bus.  The system shall be expandable.  Provide engineering drawings.  Provide operation instructions.  Demonstrate proper operation of the power factor correction system to the Construction inspector and power production foreman.
Basis of change:
Base power factor at 50HZ varies from 0.55 to 0.75 depending on load and utility supply voltage.  The financial cost of drawing reactive power from the utility grid is 0.0265 Euros/KVAR hr for KVAR hr drawn at PF less than 0.93 between 0800 and 2200  Portuguese law allows the utility company to wave the reactive power charges for up to eight months.  Lajes Field will begin paying for reactive power with the July 2005 bill.
The project performance period is expected to be 200 calendar days.  The magnitude of this project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source order to Rockwell Collins, Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA, to install and potentially acquire one to three HF-121C radio sets into the E-2C aircraft to demonstrate compatibility and non-interference with existing E-2C avionics and communications systems.  NAVAIR desires to minimize NRE effort, cost and schedule by utilizing the proven, non-developmental, HF-121C system.  The HF-121C is currently installed in the Royal Singaporean E-2C fleet and is interoperable and compatible with the Singaporean E-2C weapons system, thereby precluding major development when installed in US E-2C aircraft.  Because the development of the HF-121C in the E-2 is essentially complete, installing the HF-121C in US E-2C aircraft should be accomplished much more quickly and less expensively than if another radio set were to be installed.   The schedule delays and cost increase of qualifying another radio set in the E-2C are unacceptable.   This effort will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), as Rockwell possesses the requisite knowledge, technical expertise and proven E-2C HF-121C technical data package for installation of the HF-121C into the E-2C aircraft.  See Note 22.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Manufaturing Engineering Services (MES) for the conversion of the 14A12 Anti Surface Warfare (ASW) Team Trainer to PC-based consoles and displays to allow for future GRTS incorporation at Fleet ASW School, San Diego, CA.  This sole source award is based on FAR Part 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Anticipated award date is end of June 2005.

This sole source award is based on the following factors:

1.  Budget Risk:  The available funds are limited and will not allow for learning curve costs.  The award must be in a FFP vehicle, any other vendor must accept type of contract.
2.  Schedule Risk:  The time frame of the FFP vehicle is limited as result of bullet #1.  Due to the desire to make these enhancements in the shortest time possible, the original contractor has the most intimate knowledge and personnel assets to achieve this goal. 
3.  Interoperability Risk:  MES’s familiarity with the interface requirements after completing the TDSS Integration affords the government the best value in this situation.  Unless a vendor possesses a similar experience with interface of the existing applications, can perform the upgrades, these requirements will incur cost that will exceed the available budget.
4.  Subject Matter Expertise.

1.  INTRODUCTION

Notice of the U.S. Maritime Administration's (MARAD) intent to issue a sales solicitation to offer vessels for purchase for dismantlement to qualified ship recycling facilities.  The sales solicitation for the dismantlement of obsolete vessels shall be compliant with the requirements promulgated in Section 508 of The Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, (46 App. U.S.C. 1158 (2003)).  Statutory authority requires MARAD to dispose of its obsolete ships through the use of qualified facilities selected without predisposition toward foreign or domestic facilities.  This authority further requires MARAD to sell its vessels through the use of sealed bidding procedures. 

MARAD intends to offer specific vessel(s) for sale through a two step sealed bidding process.  These vessels will be offered through December 31, 2005 on a case by case basis and MARAD does not plan to establish a recurring schedule for the sale of vessels.  Qualified buyers may present to MARAD at any time expressions of interest for the purchase for dismantlement of specific ships however, MARAD is under no requirement to offer these ships for sale and reserves the right to offer for sale vessel(s) of its choosing.  

MARAD’s obsolete ships will be offered for sale in their current “AS – IS, WHERE – IS” condition, at their current mooring, for the sole purpose of dismantlement and recycling. MARAD will not provide an estimate of hazardous material/waste quantities and does not guarantee the amount of hazardous material/waste quantities to any Government furnished information provided to the bidder in the course of bid preparation, proposal submittal or ship checks for this disposal project.

Awards will be made to the qualified offeror who has offered the highest purchase price for the vessel(s). Bidders are responsible for procuring and conducting all necessary activities for the preparation, towing, hazardous material remediation/disposal and dismantling/recycling of the vessel(s).  

The sales process will be conducted as a two step sealed bidding process.  MARAD will qualify bidders through the submittal and evaluation of general technical proposals in step one. General technical proposals for the dismantlement of obsolete MARAD vessels may be submitted at any time.  MARAD will request a bid and vessel specific affirmations from qualified bidders for the sale for dismantlement of specific vessel(s) in step two.  MARAD will conduct a determination of bidder affirmations against specific performance criteria provided to the bidders at the time of MARAD’s request for bids.  Those bidders who are unable to comply with the published vessel specific requirements will be eliminated from the bidding process. 

The bidder shall comply with all contractual requirements, Federal, State and local laws and regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), as well as applicable international laws, treaties, conventions and agreements.
This solicitation is not a request for proposals for the reuse of obsolete MARAD vessels. Proposals submitted that advocate the reuse of MARAD vessels will be rejected.  Interested parties which wish to pursue the reuse of MARAD obsolete vessel may contact the Ship Disposal Program directly for further guidance. 
2. VESSEL LOCATIONS
MARAD's obsolete vessels are principally located in three reserve fleet locations, the James River Reserve Fleet, (JRRF), Ft. Eustis, VA, (JRRF), Suisan Bay Reserve Fleet, (SBRF), Benicia, CA (SBRF) and Beaumont Reserve Fleet, Beaumont TX. MARAD will select the vessel(s) to be placed in the solicitation and will generally dispose of its higher priority vessels first. A list of obsolete vessels available for disposal, including those designated as high priority vessels, is located in the library of MARAD's Ship Sales VOA website, http://voa.marad.dot.gov. This list will be periodically updated.
3. VESSEL EXPORT
Submissions that involve the export of vessels for dismantling/recycling are subject to the provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which prohibits the export of materials containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in concentrations above regulated limits. Where identified Liquid PCBs if found are removed from MARAD ships by MARAD prior to export. However, solid PCBs in varying quantities and concentrations may be found in some ship board components of MARAD obsolete ships and may, if above the regulated limits, be subject to the provisions of TSCA. While an exemption from the export prohibitions may be available through an administrative rulemaking process by with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the process can take from several months to over a year. Each exemption may be specific to a singular proposal and may be for a limited duration. Further, there is no guarantee that an exemption will be issued. In addition, MARAD is currently involved in litigation related to an existing vessel export contract. Until the legal challenges which are related to environmental issues are resolved, MARAD will not actively consider any export related submission received in response to this Sales Solicitation that proposes the export of solid PCB’s. Such general technical proposals that are received will be reviewed, but at this time bids will not be considered. 
B.  SOLICITATION PROCEDURES
The following outlines how MARAD will evaluate general technical proposals and make vessel awards under the sales solicitation.
Step One – Qualifying General Technical Proposals

3)	MARAD will continuously evaluate proposals. Taking into consideration its workload, MARAD will try to evaluate general technical proposals as they are received. Domestic bidders may expect an initial evaluation of their general technical proposal within six-weeks from the date the proposal is properly submitted. The evaluation period for proposals involving vessel exports will be determined on a case by case basis after reviewing the proposal for completeness against the technical compliance plan criteria and compliance with TSCA.
4)	Based on the criteria set forth in this Sales Solicitation, MARAD will evaluate each general technical proposal to determine whether it is technically acceptable, technically unacceptable but susceptible to being made technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Description
The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, is seeking information for potential joint venture partner(s) who can complement existing NTIS capabilities to deliver a wide range of end-to-end e-learning and knowledge management solutions.     The potential joint venture partner(s) would serve as solution providers to create innovative solutions that increase the performance and effectiveness of learning and knowledge management systems.     Prospective partners could provide one or more components of the ultimate system.

NTIS has extensive expertise and experience providing secure, large-scale, high-volume, Web-based solutions to government clients.     We have operated state-of-the-art e-learning solutions for government clients behind federal firewalls for years. As a self-supporting government agency, NTIS offers unique security and operating value to federal agencies. The proposed joint venture would serve federal agencies that require such value.     

NTIS expects to provide personnel, hardware, IT services, facilities, security and help desk support functions to the partnership. The solutions provided by the partner(s) will enable the partnership to provide customized, large-scale, high-volume, integrated; secure e-learning and knowledge management solutions for use by federal agencies.     Responses should address innovative e-learning and knowledge management technologies and/or address one or more of the following e-learning or knowledge management categories:

?       Functional Requirements
?       Performance Requirements
?       System Components
?       Design
?       Development
?       Delivery Platforms
?       Security
?       Accessibility - Section 508
?       Training Management
?       Program Management

The business opportunities described in this notice are joint ventures, require investments by prospective partners and yield a revenue sharing opportunity. NTIS enters into joint venture partnerships in accordance with the authority granted to NTIS in the National Technical Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 3704b) and in accordance with the guidelines published in the June 13, 1989 Federal Register. 

Joint ventures are not procurements. The partner(s) is expected to develop fully compliant and conformant integrated solutions in a premier e-learning environment that supports development of the federal workforce, advances the accomplishment of agency missions, and meets all government technical requirements. NTIS envisions the participation of one or more companies, which may all be partners if that is what they agree to do.

Responses to this RFI must describe and reference the technical capabilities of the products, describe technical expertise and provide a concise description of the existing experience and the ability to provide NTIS with necessary technical training in the use of the products.

Responses to this RFI may include proposed teams of more than one firm. Any     proposed arrangements should describe how they would function in terms of prime/sub designations, line of authority, etc.     Respondents to the RFI may be invited to make oral presentations.

It is anticipated that the future joint venture will be a revenue sharing agreement which will provide returns to the successful party or parties. Anticipated revenue streams should be addressed in the response.

If you have any questions about this RFI, please send them via e-mail to: bjackson@ntis.gov, fax (703) 605-6889.

<DESC>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is competing a new contract for support services for interdisciplinary studies in clinical cancer genetics targeting families with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a model for familial cancer. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. Although the scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the Clinical Genetics Branch professional staff, the major activities of the contract provide:  1) nursing support including contacting family members, explaining the studies, enrolling family members, obtaining clinical information and records, requesting pathology slides for diagnosis confirmation, arranging for family members to be evaluated by CGB investigators in the Cancer Genetics Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center, performing phlebotomy, obtaining other biologic specimens as necessary, arranging and conducting field trips to evaluate family members, verifying information for the family registry database, maintaining tracking systems for data and biologic specimens, developing and providing educational materials for participants, and participating in genetic counseling and risk notification; 2) maintenance of a locked medical record room to which CGB investigators have immediate access; 3) development of coordination and liaison at a local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study; 4) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 5) hiring, training and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 6) identification of study subjects, including locating persons at risk of cancer and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 7) supervision and management of field operations; 8) collecting data (interviewing/record abstraction, biologic specimen collection and processing); 9) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 10) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.  The maintenance of a secure record room which allows CGB investigators access to the medical records within 15 minutes is a mandatory requirement. There is also a mandatory requirement of the capability of nearly daily face to face meetings with the CGB staff. It is anticipated that one incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a period of five years, with a required total level of effort of 53,000 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about May 31, 2005 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. The RFP may be accessed via the NCI Research Contract Branch (RCB) website: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ under “Current Requests for Proposals”. Award of this project is anticipated by January 17, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NCI.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) is contemplating entering into a sole source contract with IBM Global Services, Inc. for application engineering and technical support services for its Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS). This is the second notice for this requirement. The initial notice was published on October 6, 2004. This action represents a continuation of service beyond the limit of the existing DADS contract options until a full and open competition is conducted and a new contract for the program is awarded. The current contract expires on September 16, 2005. The DADS program has been developed and maintained by IBM for the past seven years. This sole source contract will be for a period of up to 21 months in order to complete the RFP for the competitive procurement. It is the USCB's belief that IBM is the only capable source to provide DADS services. Interested companies having the capability to provide the above-described services should submit, via email, their capability statement to royal.a.rucker@census.gov or fax to 301-457-1781 within 15 days of this notice.   Interested companies may view the Statement of Work for FY2005 of the current contract at htttp://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html. While this is not a request for competitive proposals, responses received within 15 days from the posting of this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.  No telephone requests will be accepted. No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice, however the statements will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the USCB. If no responses are received, a sole source contract with IBM for a one-year base period with options for up to an additional 9 months will be pursued without further notice.

<DESC>Reference is made to the Pre-solicitation Notice posted on 08 June 2005 under subject â€œ81â€”Incremental Design Changes to M2A1 Metal Ammunition Canâ€ and to the  Sources Sought Notice posted on 11 February 2005 under subject â€œ81â€”Incremental  Design Changes (M2A1) Container.â€  This amendment serves to provide further  clarification to the 08 June 2005 Pre-solicitation Notice.  The US Army, Tank- automotive Armaments Command â€“ Picatinny intends to solicit and negotiate on a  sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1(2)(ii) â€“ Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or  Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, to B-Way, Inc., Homerville, GA to  provide engineering services to perform incremental design changes to the  present M2A1 Metal Ammunition Can to achieve the end goal of a stand-alone  container (i.e. a wirebound wood box will not be required for environmental  protection of the container and its contents, or unitization in the palletized  configuration).  This effort will consist of a two-phased plan to implement the  incremental design changes to the M2A1 can and to produce and deliver 10  standard M2A1 cans and 230 improved M2A1 cans, plus associated data.  The  container, by itself, will be required to survive a series of extreme shock,  drop, stack and vibration tests at temperature extremes, while maintaining a 3  psi seal.  Each phase of design changes will culminate in a test and evaluation  exercise in which the contractor will provide the Government data on container  performance.  The 10 standard cans and 60 Phase I improved cans are to be  delivered 120 days after purchase order award, and 170 Phase II improved cans  are to be delivered 180 days after purchase order award.  B-Way, Inc. is the  current producer of the M2A1 Metal Ammunition Can.  See Numbered Notes 22 and  26.

<DESC>Request for Information that describes concepts of operation for an end to end management solution regarding collection of meteorological observations from aircraft.  The Aviation Services Branch (ASB) is requesting information on operational concepts that have the potential to achieve all, or to the greatest extent possible, the requirements delineated in the National Weather Service (NWS) Statement of Need summarized below.  ASB is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received. ASB is interested in receiving information with regard to sensors and/or sensor technologies; technology management concepts; and data collection, processing and distribution capabilities that can improve the quality, frequency, and geographic distribution of meteorological reports from aircraft.  The greater temporal, spatial and vertical resolution of these reports will enable improved forecast accuracy and more frequently updated forecasts.  Small-scale environmental events have profound effects on aviation safety and the economic well-being of the nation.  The ability to predict short-term, small-scale (mesoscale) environmental change is restricted by meteorological observations that are incomplete in time and space.  The government must work in partnership with industry to enhance the upper-air observing systems and improve predictive models and methods of dissemination to gain efficiencies in the operation of the National Air Space. The NWS has a requirement for sustaining and improving the current high-resolution data set of meteorological observation elements in the troposphere some of which is provided by the Meteorological Data Communications and Reporting System (MDCRS).  MDCRS data provides ascent, descent and  enroute reports of wind speed and direction, temperature and pressure.  The data is transmitted to NWS National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) where it is used in high-resolution data assimilation and forecast systems and to NWS offices for use in weather analysis and forecasts.  The current data sets utilized by NWS have three major deficiencies that the requested information should assist the NWS to address.  The first deficiency is the critical absence of operational water vapor data.  Currently moisture data sets are acquired via single-use radiosondes and supplemented with other data such as satellite observations in collaboration with other agencies such as FAA, NASA and NESDIS, as well as other research organizations. Mesoscale reports of in-situ water vapor will significantly improve weather model forecasts and forecast products generated at local offices.  This information may allow forecasters to predict the start time of convection within 30 minutes.  The second deficiency is the lack of effective controls or mechanisms to manage and limit the collection of data relative to NWS temporal and spatial requirements.  This results in a significant level of redundant observations, especially at the hub airports, and translates into excessive and unnecessary communications costs.  The third deficiency is that the mix of aircraft is not optimal.  Ascent and descents profiles are more useful to NWS forecasts and models than the enroute observations.  This translates to a preference for regional carriers versus major air carriers. Mesoscale atmospheric profiles consisting of temperature, winds and moisture are needed to forecast, warn of, and verify mesoscale weather phenomena.  For the purposes of this document, mesoscale refers to data reporting in a horizontal spatial scale of ten’s of miles and a temporal scale from minutes to a few hours.  The spatial, temporal and accuracy requirements for an improved mesoscale atmospheric observing system will be provided upon request.  Responses must describe the offeror’s management and technical approaches to address the deficiencies described above, existing or projected performance capabilities, and the identification and availability of any pre-production prototype and/or production hardware.  Input must address the sensing of water vapor data from aircraft to support modeling and forecasting improvements for multiple applications the primary function is to support improvements to weather modeling and related services that enable safe and efficient use of the nation’s air space.  NWS desires input that outlines a complete solution that leverages prior research efforts or proven improved alternatives that maximize efficiency and capability while minimizing cost to operate and maintain.  Prior research and development has investigated TAMDAR, WVSS I and II sensing technologies in collaboration with FAA and NASA.  Potential strategies would include acquiring and managing one, or both technologies, or suggesting adequate alternatives.  In addition, inputs should describe an executable strategy beginning with selection and implementation of a product or product blend to end of product life solution.  Suggested strategy must address major aspects of a solution including: in-situ observation data, selection of sensing device, device installation process, management controls of data and mechanism to deliver data to NOAA models and forecast offices with incremental project controls, scalable implementation and total oversight of project from start to finish. Offerors planning to submit input describing how to meet the requirements should notify the contracting office of their interest.  The performance parameters for the proposed concepts of operation should be accompanied by sufficient rationale for the Government to verify the offeror’s claims.  The Government shall not accept general company capability information and will not accept such submissions. Questions and submissions will be accepted via e-mail and sent to Lamar Carlson at e-mail address shown below referencing the solicitation #. No compensation shall be provided for this RFI, this information supports planning for a RFP scheduled for FY06.  In your response state if small business and if minority owned, woman owned etc.

<DESC>The USAF is conducting market research regarding transient alert services to determine whether or not the services can be classed as commercial in nature and if so, the contractual terms and conditions common to such commercial contracts.  You can help us with this research by answering the following questions.  Any information you provide will be kept entirely confidential and is not for the purpose of “pre-qualifying” contractors.



Market research questions:

1.  For what non-federal or non-DOD entities does (or has) your company provide(d) transient alert services?  Include state, municipal, or other local government entities, as well as non-government entities.  If possible, provide a copy of the terms and conditions of the contract, or provide contact information where we can obtain information regarding the terms and conditions.

2.  If you are considering competing for this contract, what types of information will facilitate your ability to develop a competitive, fixed-price offer (nature of information and degree/quantity)?  What risks would make it difficult for you to develop such an offer?

3.  If your company normally provides transient alert services and has decided not to compete for this contract, what constraints within USAF control contributed to the decision?

<DESC>Intermittent - Subject-Matter Expert (SME).  Background:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs.  These programs are located in various countries throughout the world and address the entire range of customs and border control operations.  To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the employment and utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis.  Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 90 days or less.  Intermittent (IC) contractors will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas.  The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide.  A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection for employment. 
 
	
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter.  He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum.  Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation.  In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.


COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for "Training" above.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.


ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries.  Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights).  Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations.


TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations.  For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs law and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.


AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT:  The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member.  As an additional team member, the contractor will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies.  As a replacement or “fill-in”, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.


TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice prior to deployment.  Some IC assignments may last up to 90 days.  It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 90 days in a calendar year.  If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be removed from further consideration at CBP discretion.  


COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) Compensation will be fixed-priced at $2000 per week for all ICs or proration thereof.  2) The IC contract will include medical evacuation coverage up to $500, and medical examination costs up to $500.  3) Each IC assignment will be firm-fixed priced based on the estimated time required to complete the assignment.  4) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations.  Note: The contractor will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization.  The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel.  The contractor will not receive an advance for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.


OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a “secret” security clearance from CBP.  2) For some specific assignments, language ability may be a requirement for selection.  All materials provided to the contractor or developed by the contractor under this contract are the property of CBP and may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP.


POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations.  CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.


METHOD OF OPERATION: Potential ICs will submit their qualifications in resume format.  The Office of International Affairs will evaluate the candidates for technical ability.  Candidates will then be considered part of a “bidders” list and may be selected for future assignments.  CBP will reimburse selectees for the costs of obtaining international medical evacuation insurance and for a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 90 days for ICs.  Selected ICs will then become part of a “pool” of eligible contractors who may receive requests for services.  These contracts will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and any required materials.  All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 vendor.  ICs must register in the Central Contractor Registration system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order.


Resumes will be accepted by e-mail only.  Submit to CBP.PSC@DHS.GOV.  No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume.  Please, no phone calls.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA) will be seeking in the near future a qualified source(s) for a potential performance based commercial services contract to 1) receive and store commodities (dry, cooler, freezer) for multi-food shipments; 2) accept orders from eligible recipient agencies via internet based ordering system, and 3) deliver the food to eligible recipient agencies.
 
FSA is seeking to establish and implement a performance based services contract(s) within the United States and its Trust Territories with a facility(ies) to receive and store in household pack sizes commodities purchased by USDA for a multi-food shipment program.  The facility must be able to accept orders directly from eligible recipients of federally mandated commodity feeding programs, via an internet-based ordering system.  In addition, the commercial facility will be responsible for delivery of food to designated locations.   The various food items have different temperature requirements, and the facility must have the capability of making deliveries in conveyances that can handle food items with different temperature requirements.  Shipments will consist of mixed commodities in full and less than truckload quantities, with a potential for dry, cooler, and freezer foods in a single truck.  The facility will be required to report all product ordered and delivered to the eligible recipient agencies to USDA on a monthly basis.

The scope of this potential project has yet to be determined (regional or national). More information will be provided in the near future.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTATION EXISTS, AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION WILL BE IGNORED.

<SUBJECT>17 -- Rapid Parking Ramp Expansion (RPRE) Lightweight Airfield Mat (LAM)
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to issue Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) FA8678-06-R-0001 for review and announce an Industry Day.

The Air Armament Center, Agile Combat Support Systems Squadron (ACSSS/PK), intends to issue the draft solicitation and conduct an Industry Day for a Rapid Parking Ramp Expansion (RPRE) Lightweight Airfield Mat (LAM) System. RPRE LAM is a development, production and sustainment effort to reduce airlift weight and/or volume of the current AM-2 matting (NSN 5680-00-191-3665) by 25-50%, while providing a lighter weight replacement with as good or improved performance characteristics. RPRE LAM will support airfield taxiway and parking ramp operations for current and advanced transport (C-17) and tactical aircraft (F-15E and V-22) at expeditionary airfields world-wide.  The RPRE LAM will be lighter, less costly, have improved performance, have improved human engineering factor qualities, require less maintenance, and provide a reduced logistics footprint when compared to AM-2. Please refer to the System Requirement Document (SRD) and the Statement of Objectives (SOO) for further details about the performance parameters.     

The current contract type is Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) for system design and development (CLIN 0001), with some Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M) Option CLINs. The period of performance is approximately 24 months from award. If exercised, Option CLINs 0101-0105 will be exercised together as a separate Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract upon successful completion of CLIN 0001, with the potential for the placement of orders for up to 10 ordering years.

We anticipate that this acquisition will be full and open competition; however, the Government reserves the right to make a Small Business set aside depending on responses to this notice, Industry Day and other market research. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is currently 541710, with a size standard of 500 employees.

The RPRE LAM acquisition will be a Best Value procurement.

DRFP FA8678-06-R-0001 is posted to the FedBizOpps (FBO) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for review, comments, and questions by Industry. The Government also intends to publish a technical library on the FBO website.  This interface with Industry will assist the Government’s acquisition planning and ensuing source selection structure. Offerors will also be required to furnish a Statement of Work (SOW), Integrated Master Schedule, and System Performance Specification during the Request for Proposal (RFP) to be incorporated under any resultant contract. 

It is the Government’s intention to conduct the Industry Day for all interested parties on 22 - 23 June 2005, 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM each day, at the Destin Community Center. The address is 101 Stahlman Ave., Destin, FL 32541. Phone: 850-654-5184.

An opportunity to sign up to meet, one-on-one, with Government program personnel will be available at the meeting.  The purpose of the one-on-ones is to allow companies to provide the Government feedback on the DRFP. The Government does not desire a company’s marketing presentation, but rather information on how to make the RFP and source selection/competition better. One-on-one meetings will last approximately 20 – 30 minutes each and will start at the end of the formal presentations until 4:00 PM the first day and run from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM the second day.  Any additional information concerning the Industry Day will be posted to the FBO website as the information becomes available

The tentative date to post the RFP Solicitation FA8678-06-R-0001 to the FBO website is 20 July – 19 August 2005. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted to the FBO website as amendments to the announcement. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. 

All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004 Alternate A to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003), that lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Automated Peptide Synthesis Instrument
<DESC>The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention ( CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to AA Peptides, LLC located in Louisville, KY. for Automated Peptide Synthesis Instrument.  The Apex 396 is the established market leader in multiple and single peptide synthesizers.  The Apex 396 is unique in its ability synthesize a single peptide or to simultaneously synthesize up to 96 peptides each having a different and unique amino acid composition and sequence.  The Apex 396 synthesizer can be used to produce a peptides from 1 umol to 2grams in scale.  The indexed table of the Apex 396 allows for transfer from monomer rack to monomer rackk, monomer rack to reaction vessel, and reacton vessel to reaction vessel.  Reactor style and configuration, the size and number of monomer vials in the monomer rack (standard monomer rack supports up to thirty different monomers), and the size nd number of reagent containers provide additional flexibility.  The indexed tabletop allows for any shape, size or placement of containers permitting the implementation of a variety of peptide chemistries, including pre-activation of amino acids, as well as the development of new methodologies as may be required.  Vortex mixing of the Teflon reactor block thoroughly mixes resin and reagents while preserving the integrity of the resin beads providing highly consistent and sustainable reactions important for reliable production of high quality peptides.  Nitrogen-asisted bottom filteration empties the reactor block, resulting in rapid and simultaneously emptying of all 96 reaction wells while maintaining an inert atmosphere facilitating thorough and efficient washing of the resin to prevent impurities due to carryover.  This process, along with fast delivery, minimizes the undesirable decomposition of the peptide resin product due to extended contact with acid or base.   The Apex 396 synthesizer accommodates automated chemical cleaving of the synthesized peptides from the support resins and collection of each peptide cleavage product.  CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. However, information received will be considered solely for information purposes only. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Beth West at llw5@cdc.gov.

Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)           The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.   This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to competitively procure Aerial Refueling Store Improved Power Source (ARSIPS) Handling Fixture.  This tool has been deemed necessary as the weight of an ARSIPS unit exceeds the maximum one-person lift limit as defined by the United States Naval Safety Center.  In addition to exceeding the weight limit, carrying an ARSIPS unit by the blades will be avoided, thus preventing possible personnel injury and damage ARSIPS units.   
The ARSIPS Handling Tool will give fleet maintainers of the A/A 42R-1 Aerial Refueling Store the capability to transport, remove and replace ARSIPS units.  This tool will be utilized primarily at F/A-18 E/F organizational and intermediate levels of maintenance.  	A qty of (1) unit each of the ARSIPS Handling Tool will be provided as a First Article Test unit and if accepted will become part of the deliverables.   Delivery for the first article test unit is FOB destination toLakehurst, NJ.  The contractor shall manufacture thirty-eight  (38) ARSIPS Handling Tools with and option to purchase an additional sixteen (16) ARSIPS Handling Tools per the government supplied drawing package.  Deliveries of the ARSIPS Handling Tool shall be in quantities of 12 per month (third month shall be a quantity of fourteen (14)) beginning ninety (90) days after contract award.  Final inspection and acceptance by the Government will be at destination.  

1.	The contractor shall manufacture stated quantities of ARSIPS Handling Tools in accordance with the government-supplied drawings in the stated period of time.

2.	Any deviation from the ARSIPS Handling Tool drawing package will be reviewed for the strict purpose of reducing production cost and increasing productivity, for example; a part that could be produced through casting rather than machining.  However, it must be shown the cast part will meet all structural requirements imposed on a machined piece.  Other possibilities include using a different material that is called out on the drawing. 

3.	DCMA will be used for quality assurance and final inspection of all units (DD-250).

4.	The contractor will ship all manufactured ARSIPS Handling Tools to Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst New Jersey.  Each ARSIPS Handling Tool will be packaged in such a means to protect the tool during shipment.  

5.	Monthly progress reports to the Aerial Refueling System Support Equipment manager will be required. 




Specifications for the ARSIPS Handling Fixture are subject to Export Control regulations and will only be released to firms who are certified with the DLSC for receipt of Military Critical Technical Data.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst plans to issue SOLICITATION NUMBER N68335-05-R-0042 on or about approximately 01/25/2005.  The solicitation document will appear on the NAVAIR home page www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  However, the specifications will be mailed separately to certified requestors.  No drawings will be posted on the Navair home page.  This solicitation is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  It is requested that all interested parties submit a current completed and certified DD Form 2345 (Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement) to NAWCADLKE Contracting Office.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
