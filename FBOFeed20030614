These materials include 8’ “T” Metal Posts, 12 ½ gage smooth twisted wire, 16 gage tie wire, staples, flagging, fence clips and any other material needed to maintain these 12 exclosures that can be purchased locally.  All materials that are replaced will be removed and disposed of.  This will be set aside for a small business.  The New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax will apply.  The service Contract Act will apply.  NAIC will be 234110.  Contact Cesar 505-434-7341.  Technical questions can be addressed to PJ Haenelt 505-682-2551.
