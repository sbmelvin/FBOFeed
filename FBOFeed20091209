<DESC>The Headquarters Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA), Directorate of Programs, Air Force Family Member Programs Division is seeking sources to review and provide comments on a DRAFT Request for Proposal (DRFP). The DRFP will NOT directly result in a contract award. The FMPBMS Draft RFP is a research vehicle to determine the viability of the FMPBMS project, its scope and costs. The DRFP is intended to further define requirements for a best-in-breed, enterprise-grade, Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) web-accessible business management solution (BMS) that will include customer registration, activity enrollment, point-of-sale (POS), inventory management and sports scheduling capabilities, to support worldwide Family Member Programs (FMP) business operations [Child Development Centers (CDC), Family Child Care (FCC) Offices and Resource Centers, School-Age facilities and Youth Centers/Teen Centers]. The proposed solution is herein after referred to as FMPBM or FMPBMS. This is a nonappropriated fund purchase and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government. Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs. This purchase does not involve federal tax dollars. <br /><br />The AFSVA seeks a Contractor that will provide hardware, software and any other equipment, or materials and labor required to successfully perform the objectives described in the DRFP. The AFSVA instructs interested Contractors to review the requirements as written and provide feedback on opportunities to the NAFI to improve the solicitation. Contractor comments should reflect whether or not general price categories are adequately accounted for (hardware, maintenance, training, etc.), whether or not the Contractor could reasonably comply with required AF standards and IA requirements, as well as any other areas that may aid the AFSVA in clearly communicating product and service needs in a way that is commensurate with industry offerings. The FMPBMS contract must ultimately provide clients and domains with support for current and evolving requirements in sensitive but unclassified environments. The FMPBMS must be a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III system with a confidentiality level of "Sensitive." Areas of user support will include: COTS installation, system, web and database administration; engineering; systems analysis; software development; security; configuration, program and asset management; data backup and storage; disaster recovery; and surge support for related but unanticipated elevations in service.<br /><br />The DRFP can be accessed through the U.S. Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office website: http://www.afnafpo.afsv.net/Links/AFNAFPO_BusinessOpps.htm. Documents will be available within 5 business days of this posting.<br /><br />After review of vendor comments, the AFSVA may choose to issue an RFP for the FMPBMS if the project is still deemed viable.<br /><br />All interested parties can direct inquiries to Barbara Jewett at 210-652-6931, ext.7260 or via email at AFSVABusinessOperations@randolph.af.mil. A copy of the DRFP can be accessed using the following:&nbsp;http://www.afnafpo.afsv.net/Links/AFNAFPO_BusinessOpps.htm. All responses shall be submitted via electronic response using an encrypted e-mail and attaching only MS Word or PDF attachments - no ZIP files please. All responses shall be received no later than Friday, 8 January 2009, 4:00 p.m. CST. Responses to questions regarding this DRFP and other associated information can be found on the AFNAFPO website, within 5 days after questions cut-off. The information received will be considered confidential and will not be disclosed without the express written consent of the supplier. This notice does not express or imply intent to purchase any service or to enter into a contractual agreement. Any information provided will be at no cost to the Government.

In 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change reiterated that clouds remain the largest source of uncertainty inprojections of future climate change.  Current climate models are still far fromrealistically representing clouds.  Progress in improving the representation of clouds in the models will be accelerated byutilizing remote sensing observations in combination with cloud-resolving models toevaluate models and better understand cloud processes.	U.S. climate modeling groups donot have the resources and expertise required to analyze large multi-year satellitedatasets or to run their own cloud-resolving model simulations.  The ARRA tasks include the application of software that isolates weather and climatevariations due to two of the most important types of variability observed in nature, theEl Nino Southern Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, to various satellitedatasets.  The analyses of the satellite data will be posted online, along with thesoftware required for the modeling groups to produce similar analyses of their ownclimate models, thus facilitating model-data comparisons that will highlight modeldeficiencies and provide targets for future model improvement.	The ARRA research also includes the production of atmospheric structure and circulationdiagnostics from cloud-resolving model simulations.  For global modeling groups that donot have access to a cloud-resolving model, these results, also made available online,can be used to test hypotheses about cloud processes that can lead to parameterizationimprovements that can be implemented in a global climate model.  This research supports the NASA mission to better understand the Earth system and enhancethe nations ability to predict future climate change.	Tasksa.  Produce and make publicly available, monthly mean ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation)anomaly gridded fields for a variety of multi-year datasets as well as the software forpost-processing calculation of ENSO anomaly fields in general circulation models.b.  Produce and make publicly available, a multi-year database of 3-hourly gridded ISCCP(International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) weather state classifications for thetropics, along with diurnal cycle and MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) composites andCloudSat-CALIPSO GEOPROF-Lidar composites for each weather state and MJO phase.c.  Produce and make publicly available, sampled 3-D dynamic and thermodynamic fields forWRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model cloud-resolving deep convection simulationsover land and ocean.NASA/GSFC intends to incorporate an additional category into the Annual Mission Forecastfor contract NNG06HX21C with Sigma Space Partners.  Cost Plus Award Fee Contract No.NNG06HX21C was awarded to Sigma Space Partners on June 27, 2006, on a competitive basis.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the National Guard Bureau intends to increase the ceiling from $40,000,000 to $49,000,000 for the Professional and Administrative Support Services (PASS), Schedule V, General Trade, Transportation and Light Industrial Support Services IDIQ contract with TSI Corporation, Las Vegas NV under contract number W912JB-06-D-4016.  Due to the high demand of the services on this contract, capacity will soon be reached.  This increase is to cover within scope changes and to perform existing and planned tasks until the new procurement is awarded (anticipated for mid March 2010).  The new requirement is synopsized on FedBizOpps, solicitation W912JB-10-R-4001.  The original ordering period of the contract with options expires in March 2011 and will not be extended.  It is in the best interest of the government to use the incumbent contractor, TSI Corporation, for modifications to on-going task orders and to provide services for planned tasks.  Continuation and follow-on of current support by TSI Corporation will allow the Government to fulfill requirements for continued support for General Trade, Transportation and Light Industrial Support Services until a new contract can be awarded.  In order to maintain continuity of existing services, TSI Corporation is the only contractor capable of meeting the governments Professional and Administrative Support Services requirements, time and other factors considered.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /> <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and <br />Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis the services of Washington University, 4960 Children's Place, St. Louis, Missouri 63110 in support of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for eight months from date of award.</p>
<p>The (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, is a multicenter randomized trial that is evaluating the effectiveness of prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening modalities on disease-specific mortality.  The additional data collection requested will develop a PLCO resource that can facilitate the identification of the most relevant etiologic factors associated with prostate cancer recurrence and progression.</p>
<p>Current PLCO infrastructure is in place for long-term mortality follow-up.  However, clinical follow-up is limited to one-year post-diagnosis, which identifies the initial course of treatment used for men diagnosed with prostate cancer, including both surgical (providing pathological stage and grade) and non-surgical options.  The purpose of the current procurement is to extend the follow-up time beyond the first year post-diagnosis to capture all clinically relevant data related to prostate cancer recurrence and progression.  This information will supplement existing PLCO resources that have been collected by this Contractor (and 9 other screening centers) from 1993 to the present.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>1.	Send an introductory letter to all PLCO subjects identified with early stage prostate cancer at HFHS introducing the follow-up study.<br />2.	Administer telephone interviews with men enrolled in PLCO and diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer at Washington University.<br />3.	Abstract data from electronic medical records for those men who report a recurrence, progression, or additional treatment during the interview.<br />4.	Send hardcopies of interviews and abstracted medical record forms to Westat.<br />5.	Provide a summary report to NCI describing the data collection process and overall ascertainment results including estimates of the response rates and completeness of medical record ascertainment.</p>
<p>Washington University is one of 10 screening centers participating in the PLCO Trial.  Participants within PLCO are actively followed by the screening center coordinators on an annual basis with a short, self-administered survey intended to ascertain new cancer-related outcomes (incidence and mortality).</p>
<p>The Washington University screening center has served as a pilot center for other new studies conducted within PLCO, so the staff has unique experience and expertise in piloting new questionnaires and medical record abstraction forms.  Also, Dr. Andriole, the Principal Investigator at Washington University, is an urologist and the Chair of the PLCO prostate cancer subcommittee.  Therefore, he brings a unique and important clinical expertise specific to prostate cancer that will assist the National Cancer Institute during this formative pilot stage in the refinement of the data collection tools and procedures.  Finally, the sole source contract is necessary due to the already existing infrastructure that has been in place for more than a decade supporting the data collection efforts within PLCO.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Salient Characteristics:<br />1. Efficiency<br />The Storage Device must use both inline deduplication to prevent the storage of duplicate data blocks and compression to maximize disk utilization. <br />&bull;Inline deduplication must automatically recognize duplicate patterns in the backup stream in real time and only store unique blocks. Devices not capable of true inline deduplication or devices that require disk space to ingest and store non-deduplicated data will not be accepted. <br />&bull;Deduplication process must utilize a sub-file variable-length segment recognition and filtering process that works at block sizes as small as 4 kilobytes to maximize efficiency. Systems that use fixed blocks will not be accepted. <br />&bull;After data is deduplicated, the Storage Device must automatically compress the deduplicated data before writing to disk for additional storage savings. Storage devices not capable of data compression will not be accepted. <br />&bull;Deduplication must be performed across the entire Storage Device to maximize efficiency. Storage Devices that deduplicate only within a volume limits efficiency and will not be accepted. <br />&bull;All recoveries must be from data at rest in a deduplicated and compressed state</p>
<p>2. Assured Data Recovery<br />Automatic verification, integrity checking and system resiliency to ensure all data will be accurately restored when needed.<br />&bull;The Storage Device must perform an automatic verification at the time of backup to ensure that all data is protected on disk as it was written to support reliable accurate restores. <br />&bull;Capability to automatically notify the administrator in the event the verification process discovers a discrepancy. <br />&bull;Automatic integrity-checking and self-healing to include fault avoidance and containment, on-the-fly error detection and correction, and automatic file system recoverability. Process to continually verify that the data stored on the system can be accessed, re-assembled and presented in its original form. <br />&bull;Storage Device hardware must be resilient with hot-swappable components and must utilize RAID-6 to protect against data loss and service disruption associated with dual drive failure within same RAID group. <br />&bull;System must be capable of digitally shredding deleted data without disrupting valid data</p>
<p><br />3. Capacity and Performance <br />&bull;Storage Device requires minimum of 20 TB of capacity to retain at least 30 days of backups in data center footprint no larger than 3 rack units <br />&bull;System must be capable of completing ingestion/deduplication/compression of backup data at speeds greater than 1TB per hour <br />&bull;System must be able to complete full backup in fewer than 8 hours to result in all data protected on disk in a deduplicated and compressed state</p>
<p>4. Interoperability and Expandability<br />The Storage Device shall be a self-contained disk system (i.e. appliance) that is simultaneously configured as a Virtual Tape Library and a NAS system. <br />&bull;All backup/recovery administration shall be performed using the CommVault enterprise backup/recovery software <br />&bull;Deduplication, compression and verification process shall be automatic and work seamlessly with all client data <br />&bull;System must be capable of supporting future replication/DR requirements such that deduplicated data starts replicating when backup starts to achieve Recovery Point Objectives <br />&bull;System must be capable of supporting future nearline/archiving requirements via NAS interface and must be able to deduplicate all data regardless of interface or application <br />&bull;Architecture must be expandable and scaleable in both capacity and performance to at least 3 times the original size.</p>
<p>5. Replication<br />The Storage Device must be able to replicate deduplicated data over the Wide Area Network to like system at DR/COOP site to achieve daily off site data protection in bandwidth efficient manner.<br />&bull;System must be capable of preventing duplicate data blocks from being transmitted to DR/COOP system to maximize efficiency of available WAN bandwidth <br />&bull;Replication technology must be able to start replicating deduplicated data as soon as the backup starts. Technology that cannot start replicating until after backup/deduplication ends will not be accepted. <br />&bull;Replication must be automatic and take place in real time to result in copy of backup data protected at DR/COOP site after completion of backup job. Every backup job must be protected on disk in deduplicated state at both primary site and DR/COOP site every day to achieve RPO/RTO. Technology that requires replication scheduling or that cannot replicate deduplicated data during the backup window will not be accepted. <br />&bull;Restore performance on all backup jobs at DR/COOP site must be equal to the restore performance on all backup jobs at the primary site. <br />&bull;Replication TCP port must be configurable and bandwidth throttling capability must be built into the system.</p>
<p>6. Past Performance<br />&bull;Product must be at version 3.0 or later and must have been generally available in the market for at least four years <br />&bull;Product must have no fewer than 40 customers in the Department of Defense using the deduplication technology in production environments</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM-Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Program Manager, Special Operations Forces  Survival, Support and Equipment Systems (PM SOF-SSES) Natick, MA has a Request for Information with regards to an upcoming MICH helmet solicitation.  This upcoming solicitation is a follow on not a re-opening of  the MICH-W911QY09R0019 solicitation from June 2009 for a non-commercial non-developmental Modular Integrated Communication Helmet (MICH) Product Improved Helmet System.   The helmet system requirement will be IAW with a revised MICH SPEAR Helmet Performance Specification dated December 2009 (previous spec dated 28 Nov 08) and have two (2) categories of MICH Helmet shells; 1) MICH-BALLISTIC and 2) MICH-BUMP.  Both helmets will have to meet all the requirements in the revised MICH specification with the exception that the MICH-BUMP helmet will not have to meet any ballistic requirements.  More specifically, as stated in the revised MICH specification, both MICH helmets shall be utilized by the operator for the full spectrum of SOF mission requirements allowing operators to conduct primary or collateral functions.   From insertion by various platforms and operational techniques through complex actions on the objective, to eventual extraction by various platforms and/or techniques there is a constant need for modular ballistic protection and non-ballistic bump protection. The MICH helmet system will be used throughout the spectrum of Special Operations Forces (SOF) operational continuum, from Humanitarian Assistance and Peacekeeping, through Counter-Terrorism and Counterinsurgency, to low intensity conflict and full-scale war.  The environmental conditions will range from tropic to arctic and from arid desert to open ocean with weather conditions associated with these environments to include limited visibility. The MICH system helmets, the MICH-BALLISTIC and the MICH-BUMP shall provide a stable platform to accept the mounting of standard SOF Night Optical Devices, and other SOF mission essential equipment including, but not limited to, NBC equipment, communications devices, weapons, body armor and Load Carrying System.  Both systems can be worn separately or together depending on the offerors design approach.  The MICH-BALLISTIC is an improved MICH helmet that provides the SOF Operator with the current state of the art, or better ballistic and impact protection at a lighter weight and improved operational suitability.  The MICH-BUMP shall provide the SOF operator superior protection for head impacts from non-ballistic events.   It is anticipated that the MICH BUMP will be significantly lighter than the MICH- BALLISTIC and may offer increased impact performance.  All Helmet mounted mission equipment shall be easily integrated and with minimal effort be removed and installed between the MICH-BALLISTIC and MICH-BUMP and vice versa.  The following information is requested:<BR><BR>1)	If an RFP is released by the end of January 2010, does your company anticipate responding to this solicitation?  Is your company small or large business?  <BR>2)	A modified RFP selection process and slight technical specification changes are being considered.  The government is interested in getting your comments on these new requirements.  Three requirements changes include:<BR>a.	Not utilizing the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) specification in the initial proposal selection criteria.  The new selection process will require the proposers to submit test data only in accordance with the revised MICH Performance Specification dated December 2009.  Comments, concerns?<BR>b.	The ballistic testing requirements in the new MICH Performance Specification call for the introduction of a new clay head form used for ballistic deformation tests which were provided to industry back in June 2009.  Are there any issues with this new head form?  Have you conducted any testing on this new head form?  <BR>c.	The government is considering a change to the side-side and top-bottom compression resistance testing.  The test loading in the specification will remain unchanged (300 lbs side-side, 400 lbs top-bottom) but pass/fail criteria will now be based on a one time deflection measurement while the load is applied and then have the helmets recovery after the load is removed.   Each helmet will be tested once at all of the environmental conditions listed in the MICH specification dated December 2009.   The intent is to not over design the helmets while keeping them as light as possible but assure the wearers head does not get crushed during an accident or operational scenario.  Comments, concerns?<BR><BR>All interested contractors please respond to the RFI no later than 16 Dec 09.  Contact Nathan Jordan at nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil if you have any questions or need additional information including a copy of the new specification.<BR>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Plant Conservation Program, has a requirement for interns trained in plant conservation biology to be used to collect native seed on public land for the purpose of increasing the amount of and kinds of seed available for biodiversity restoration work.  The contractor through its interns will provide approximately 7,500 native seed collections from public lands managed by the BLM for the Seeds of Success project which is a part of the BLM Plant Conservation Program.  Work will include providing data about the collected native seed.  Contractor shall provide up to 60 interns trained in native plant identification, seed collection protocols, data collection methods, documentation, parameters of the BLM Seed of Success program, and safety.  Each intern will perform seed duties for a minimum of four consecutive months to a maximum of 18 months.  Each intern must possess a four-year college degree.  The BLM will pay a fully loaded labor rate (a firm fixed price per intern) for each intern to contractor who will be responsible for recruitment, training, supervision, and deliverables.  The BLM will reimburse any prior-approved travel expenses for interns to and from sites.  This contract shall have a performance period of approximately 24 months.  The estimated start date for the contract is February 1, 2010.  Potential sites for collection may be within Arizona, Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming, and Utah.
Funding for the contract will utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act).  Unique provisions required for implementing the Recovery Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements will be included in the contract.  Receipt of the contract by the successful contractor will be contingent upon that contractor meeting the requirements in Section 1512 of the Recovery Act. 
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), the Government considers the services specified as a sole source to the Chicago Horticultural Society doing business as the Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG), Glencoe, Illinois, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that entity on that basis.  CBG is considered the sole source for this contract based on the following factors:     1)  CBG has specialized knowledge of the Seeds of Success program and its protocols and requirements.  Since 2003, CBG scientists and seed collectors have harvested over 1,000 species of native seed for the program.  In support of this collection effort, CBG has conducted Seeds of Success training workshops for hundreds of interns and volunteers; 2)  CBG has six scientists with doctorate degrees who work on habitat restoration and seed issues, and who can support the intern training and seed work; 3) CBG coordinates a thriving intern program, developed jointly with the BLM.  This intern program has placed 401 interns in BLM offices since 2002.  Approximately 125 of those CBG interns have worked on seed collection for the BLM. 4) CBG has institutional resources in its 38,000-square-foot Plant Conservation Science Center, featuring a seed quarantine room, seed preparation room, seed laboratory, and a 250-square-foot seed vault  all of which support its seed collection efforts and intern program; 5) CBGs seed program and seed bank are unique in that they specialize in native species and the protection of biodiversity; 6) CBG offers a masters degree and a PHD program jointly with Northwestern University in the scientific specialties used by the Seeds for Success Program, giving CBG unique recruitment opportunities; and 7) CBG has seven years of past experience in placing interns in 11 states to perform Seeds for Success activities.
However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Concerns that think they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials that correspond to the required services.  Affirmative responses will be reviewed to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists; therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request and will not be considered.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.  Affirmative responses may be made no later than 5 p.m., Mountain Time, on December 21, 2009, to Cheryl Flanagan, Contracting Officer, by emailing to Cheryl_Flanagan@blm.gov (underscore mark between first and last names) or by FAX to the attention of Cheryl Flanagan at 303-236-9421.

<DESC>This is the first phase of the procurement for the construction and relocation of a VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) in Kona, Hawaii.  In the first phase, as outlined in this solicitation, we will prequalify vendors in accordance with the listed evaluation criteria.  The QVL will rank vendors according to their strengths and weaknesses as proposed in each of the applications.
In the second phase, after the qualified vendors list (QVL) is established, a second solicitation will be issued to all members of the QVL.  That solicitation will contain a finalized statement of work, specifications and drawings.  It will also include the corresponding Davis-Bacon Wage Determination and, if applicable, require a sub-contracting plan .  At that time, only a price and a cover letter will be requested.  Price will be considered in conjunction with the scores allotted to the firms in the first phase of the solicitation.  Price is of secondary concern to the Agency and technical factors are more important, therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer.  In other words, the Agency is seeking offers which provide the best combination of attributes and price in order to select the greatest value or "best buy" offer. 
For consideration purposes, a tiered evaluation of offers will be used in this source selection.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received.  Once offers are received the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified in this SIR.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until award can be made.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):
a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).c)	Very small business.d)	Small business.e)	Other-than small business
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation awarded Contract 08CS200167 to Resource Strategies Inc. for one (1) year with four (4) option years on July 30, 2008.  However, while the government advertized the base contract, the government inadvertently failed to synopsize the four (4) option years.  This synopsis will serve to satisfy that requirement.
The Bureau of Reclamation issued a Request for Proposals for a firm fixed-price contract for the purpose of acquiring digital terrain corrected satellite imagery of the irrigated areas of the Newlands Project at acceptable pixel resolution of 3 meters or smaller.  Imagery is required four times per year for five (5) years in order to adequately assess irrigation status. The irrigated area encompasses approximately 60,000 acres of irrigation and approximately 100,000 acres total.  The general area of interest is from the western edge of Fernley, Nevada to the eastern edge of the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge and from the southern edge of Carson Lake and Pasture to approximately 4 miles north of Tarzyn Road where it crosses the Carson River and represents approximately 270,000 acres.  The contractor will provide all necessary services to acquire the digital imagery per Reclamation specifications.  

This procurement was set-aside for Small Business concerns only. Solicitation 08SP200151 was posted on http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about 05/28/2008. The date for receipt of proposals was approximately 06/09/2008.  Questions concerning this synopsis should be directed to DeAnna Mannel by email at dmannel@usbr.gov.

<DESC>Key Dates<br />Release Date: December 9, 2009<br />Response Date:  January 15, 2010<br />Issued by<br />Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) (http://www.nichd.nih.gov) <br />Purpose<br />This is a time-sensitive Request for Information that will be used to assess the need to perform pediatric labeling studies of ketamine for short term procedures performed in the Emergency Department.<br />"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only." <br />Background<br />The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) legislation enacted in 2002 (renewed in 2007), directs the (NIH) in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of "off-patent" drugs for which pediatric studies are most urgently needed. <br />Ketamine has become one of the most favored drugs used by emergency physicians for sedation of children in the Emergency Department. Despite its extensive use, ketamine is not labeled in pediatrics by the Food and Drug Administration. Ketamine has been prioritized for study by NICHD under BPCA since February 2004.<br /> Recently, concerns have arisen about the safety of ketamine due to the appearance of proapoptopic effects in the developing central nervous system in young experimental animals.  Neuro-apoptosis have been demonstrated in rodents and non-human primates at doses several fold higher that those used in children. Additionally, in young experimental animals neuro-apoptotic lesions have been associated with long term behavioral deficits.<br />Information Requested<br />The NIH is especially interested in concrete and relevant suggestions to the following questions in order to determine the scientific and regulatory need to sponsor clinical drug studies on the pediatric use of ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Room. <br />Questions<br />1.	Are there sufficient data to assess the neurotoxicity of single exposure to ketamine?  To what extent is the dose(s) used in nonclinical studies relevant to the exposure levels used in ER departments to achieve sedation and analgesia for short-term procedures?
<p>2.	Are the data on the dosage of ketamine in experimental young animals applicable to children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Department?</p>
<p>3.    The vulnerability period for the development of neuroapoptosis lesions after ketamine exposure spans from the third trimester of pregnancy to approximately 3 years of age; however the drug is most commonly used in the ER in children 3 years and older. Could labeling studies be safely be performed in children between 3 and 12 years of age? <br />4.   Are data on the pharmacodynamics of ketamine in experimental animals applicable to human study designs? Conversely, are there issues in experimental studies that need to be considered in the design of pediatric studies?<br />5.  Considering the large inter-individual variability in the metabolism of ketamine, should studies be performed to analyze the effects of polymorphisms (CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and ontogeny (CYP2C9) of the ketamine-metabolizing enzymes in  pharmacokinetics and adverse events?<br />6.  If a two phased study ( i.e., pharmacokinetics and or pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study followed by an efficacy and safety clinical study) is requested,  which pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  measurements and efficacy and safety endpoints should be included?<br />7.  Considering that racemic ketamine is used in the United States, should PK studies include measurements of ketamine enatiometers?<br />8.  How should the study population of children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the ER    be defined?<br /> How to Submit a Response</p>
<p>Please provide your response to this Request for Information (RFI) to Lynn Salo at salol@mail.nih.gov no later than January 8, 2010.  Responses should be submitted as an e-mail attachment in PDF format. Please limit responses to fifteen (10) pages or less.

SECTION C/ STATEMENT OF WORK


C.1.	DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

A.	OBJECTIVE
	This statement of Work (SOW) describes the tasks assist the Agency in the continued development 	training, and maintenance of its Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) and Pandemic Flu Plan for the John M. Eisenberg Building, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  These plans are in accordance with Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD1), Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program Requirements and, Federal Executive Branch Mission Essential Function and Primary Mission Essential Function Identification and Submission Process (FCD2) dated February 2008.  The Pandemic Flu Plan is in accordance with the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, issued by President Bush November 2005 (hereafter FCD1, FCD2, & Pandemic Flu Plan shall be referred to as COOP).  All maintenance to the COOP must be developed in total compliance to established Department and Federal level COOP guidance.

B.	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED ITEMS

	At the request of the Contractor, the Government will provide any AHRQ and AHRQ/DHHS-related 	information/documents needed to complete the task.

C.	CONTRACTOR FURNISHED ITEMS

	The Contractor shall supply all materials, supplies, equipment and personnel needed to complete the 	tasks required under this contract.  The Contractor shall procure all non-DHHS related information/documents needed for this contract at no additional cost.

D.	BACKGROUND

	The DHHS Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) is in need of a continuance program 	to the current Continuity of Operation (COOP) Plan Maintenance Program to ensure that the AHRQ COOP is up to date at all times and that all employees and COOP Team 	members are adequately trained to perform COOP activities. A changing threat environment and recent events emphasize the need for COOP capabilities that will enable AHRQ to continue its essential functions across a broad spectrum of emergencies. COOP planning establishes operational procedures to sustain essential 	functions if normal operations are not feasible and guides the restoration of AHRQ to full 	operational status following an emergency. The AHRQ COOP will provide for attaining operational capability within 12 hours and sustaining operations for up to 30 days or longer as the result of a catastrophic event or a national security emergency affecting the Rockville, MD, metropolitan area.

	In light of the events of September 11, 2001, and the continuing range of possible threats, including terrorism, the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the eventuality of Pandemic Flu threats, AHRQ needs to continue to revise and improve its COOP Plan to ensure it can respond quickly to any 	natural or man-made disasters across a wide range of potential emergencies.

	Beyond the Federal Continuity Directives and Presidential Decision requirements, COOP planning is just “good business practice” that will assist AHRQ in safeguarding personnel, records, and facilities; planning for emergency acquisition of emergency resources; and ensuring the capability to perform at alternate work sites until normal operations can be resumed. Having an active and viable COOP Maintenance Program assures AHRQ is prepared and able to operate in the face of any “all-hazards” 	emergency incident, be it a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a disruption of vital services, or other crisis.



E.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

	The period of performance shall be 1 year, beginning with the date of contract award with four 1-year options.  

F.	SUMMARY OF TASKS 

	The tasks to be performed by the Contractor during each 12-month period are summarized as follows:
 
		Task 1-	Conduct one COOP Working Group Meeting per quarter.

	Task 2-	Revise AHRQ COOP Plan and Pandemic Flu Plan

(a)  Release and Use – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use – Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

The purpose of such consultation is to assure that:

(A) identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) the confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	the quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b)(1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1)(C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1)(C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	the Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. 

(d)  Copyright – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c)(1)(i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Government’s stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2.	 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.  






H.3.	508 COMPLIANCE, IF APPLICABLE  

This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site.  

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.  

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board’s Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board’s standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 

Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

Subcontracts

Award of any subcontract is subject to the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, following review of the supporting documentation.  Failure to obtain prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may result in disallowance of use of Federal funds to cover services under the subcontract.  The Contractor must include in any subcontract executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract the requirements of H.1 (Release and Use and Copyright of Data First Produced from Work Performed under this Contract), H.2 (Lack of Compliance with Requirements for Release or Use) and the Salary Rate Limitation Legislation Provision.  These requirements are to be included as stated and no clause may be included to diminish these requirements.  If approved, a copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.


Salary Rate Limitation Legislation Provision

Pursuant to the applicable HHS appropriations acts cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.  For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts. However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants. If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that— 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals— 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 

K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

(c)	The Contractor shall include this clause in every subcontract and purchase order that is subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this contract.

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

	  		(ii)	(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and -

      			(iv)	If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

    			(v)	Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.  Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.  If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, “Facsimile Proposals.”  Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative’s identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

	(e)	Restriction on disclosure and use of data.  Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall —

		(1)	Mark the title page with the following legend:

“This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed–in whole or in part–for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal.” If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of–or in connection with– the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and

		(2)	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

“Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.”

	(f)	Contract award.

		(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

		(3)	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

		(4)	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

		(5)	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

		(6)	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so.

		(7)	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

		(8)	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
						
		(9)	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.

		(10)	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

		(11)	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: 

			(i)	The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.

			(ii)	The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.

			(iii)	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection

(iv)	A summary of the rationale for award

(v)	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

(vi)	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offerors as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.7	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

	Introduction

The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  

 a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that a cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

b.        Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.  

c.        Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 4 separate parts. To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

I.		TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.8). Please mark as original or copy. 

II.	PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.9) 

III.	BUSINESS PROPOSAL:  See Business Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10).                                                   

                               
Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-  to the cognizant audit agency and the Government 
   Accountability Office (GAO) for auditing;
			-  to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-  to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-  to qualified experts, not within the definition of 
                                       Department employees for opinions as a part of
                                       the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.

	SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


Evaluation Factors for Award

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three (3) factors, and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The three factors are:  technical, cost, and past performance.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor for this requirement, past performance, is also important to the overall contract award decision.  Offerors who submit technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated on their past performance.  Following this evaluation, a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all.

All proposals will be reviewed in accordance with the governing regulations and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) policies and procedures.  The technical proposal and past performance information will be evaluated in terms of the offeror’s responses to each of the evaluation factors.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the likelihood of meeting the Government’s requirements.  The evaluation factors and assigned weight which will be used in the overall review of the offeror’s proposal are outlined on the next page.  The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to Evaluation Criteria A through E.  The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  

OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE:  Evaluation Criteria A through E, for a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a technical peer review committee, who will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.  Program staff and contracting staff will review and evaluate Past Performance Criteria for a total of 20 points.  The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria A through E and Past Performance are 120 points.

 EVALUATION CRITERIA

1.	Award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government, cost and the below factors considered.  Paramount consideration shall be given to technical quality rather than cost.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical quality between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost may become the determining factor in award selection.

BREAKDOWN OF PROPOSED ESTIMATED COST (PLUS FEE) AND LABOR HOURS

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE FORMAT

1.	Refer to Business Proposal Instructions, Section L of this solicitation. The Instructions contain the requirements for proper submission of cost/price data which must be adhered to.

2.	This sample format has been prepared as a universal guideline for all solicitations. It may require amending to meet the specific requirements of this solicitation.  For example, this solicitation may require the submission of cost/price data for three years listed on this form.  (See Section L, Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors, for the estimated duration of this project.)  At the beginning of the cost breakdown, state the proposed period of performance (actual dates) that proposed costs are based upon.   If this solicitation is phased, identify each phase in addition to each year with a total for each year, phase, and sub-element.

3.	This format must be used to submit the breakdown of all proposed estimated cost elements. Each cost element and sub-element for direct costs, indirect costs and fee, if applicable, should be listed. In addition, provide detailed calculations for all items. For example:

	a.	For all personnel, list the name, title, rate per hour and number of hours proposed. If a 	pool of personnel is proposed, list the composition of the pool and how the cost proposed was 	calculated. List the factor used for prorating Year One and the escalation rate applied between 	years.  Provide a copy of the most recent payroll register for ALL proposed employees.  If 	necessary, show proposed hourly rate calculations for each employee.  State salary increase 	policy, as well as proposed increase factor.  If it is company policy for employees to receive 	salary increases on their anniversary dates of hire, please indicate the anniversary date s of hire 	for each proposed employee.  Break down of proposed unloaded direct labor rates and 	proposed number of direct labor hours for each employee for each contract year is also 	required.

	Offeror's proposal should be stated in the same terms as will be used to account for and record 	direct labor under a contract (i.e. percentage of effort is used for most faculty and professional 	employees at educational institutions).  If percentages of effort are used, the basis to which 	such percentages are applied must also be submitted by the offeror.  The attached format 	should be revised to accommodate direct labor proposed as a percentage of effort.

	b.	For all materials, supplies, and other direct costs, list all unit prices, etc., to detail how 	the calculations were made.  Submit supporting documentation for each proposed unit cost.  	Examples of accepted forms of documentation include invoices, catalog pages, quotations, and 	general ledgers showing historical costs for comparable items, which must be broken down by 	contract year showing proposed total quantities per year and corresponding proposed unit 	costs for each item.

	c.	For all indirect costs, list the rates applied and the base the rate is applied to.  A copy of 	the most current rate agreement should be submitted.  If no rate agreement exists, detailed 	calculations of all proposed indirect rates should be shown, supported by audited or reviewed 	financial statements.

	d.	For all travel, list the specifics for each trip.

e.	For any subcontract proposed, submit a separate breakdown format.

f.	  Justification for the need of some cost elements may be listed as an attachment, i.e., special equipment, above average consultant fees, etc.  Detailed breakdown of each proposed direct cost element by contract year, (not by task only), showing proposed total quantities per year and corresponding proposed unit costs for each item.

g.	Indicate the proposed dates of performance for each contract year.

															
4.	If the Government has provided "uniform pricing assumptions" for this solicitation, the offeror must comply with and identify each item.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) APHIS/PPQ/PBWRF (Pink BollWorm Rearing Facility), in Phoenix, Arizona intends contract to procure 10,000 to 60,000lbs of AGAR per year . All Subject to Sample Approval. This will be a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery /Indefinite Quantity type Contract for the next 9 months with a possible additional of 2 years. All pricing to include any and all costs but not limited to: overhead, general and administrative costs, profit, and transportation.
<p>Base Period 01/01/2010 - 9/30/2010 <br />Period 1 10/01/2010 - 09/30/2011<br />Period 2 10/01/2011 - 09/30/2012</p>
<p>The PBWRF uses agar as a binding agent in the artificial insect diet prepared for rearing larvae of the pink bollworm. Contrary to most artificial insect diets containing agar, the pink bollworm diet is not left intact as poured, but is shredded into noodles approximately 5 mm wide and of varying thickness and length. Because of this special method of use, the agar acts more as a binding agent than it does a gelling agent as in other insect diets. As such, the requirements are more critical in terms of physical properties especially the strength of the gel (1.34% concentration) and the ability to retain moisture for a relatively long period of time. The agar supplied shall be the dried product of the water soluble extract of a species of Pterocladium, Gelidium or Gracilaria confervoides. <br />Excessive moisture loss from the diet results in two problems. If the loss comes from moisture-holding capability of the agar, the nutrients in the diet become too concentrated and if the loss comes from excessive syneresis, the resultant free moisture causes the death of neonate larvae by drowning. In the case of the pink bollworm, the artificial diet not only provides the larvae with essential nutrients for their development, but also provides their living space. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed above.<br />Delivery Location: (FOB Destination)<br />USDA/APHIS/PPQ/PBWRF<br />3645 East Chipman Road<br />Phoenix, AZ 85040</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing equipment at PPT sites.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):  CA/CST The purchase of NetIQ RNWL warranty support and hard drive disk retention for systems currently deployed at PPT sites.  The warranty support must be bought directly from NetApp as no other manufacturers or vendors provide NetApp branded warranty coverage for equipment.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.   The 41 USC 253 (c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as statutory authority.  A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.  Due to Cs investment and overall satisfaction with the NetIQ RNWL equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the NetIQ PPT. Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and this particular product.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a small business set aside.
<p>This solicitation number is RFQ1366282 and a solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37.</p>
<p>The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study requires a Perl-CGI programmer to write dynamic web-based applications for collecting, summarizing, and reporting medical, physiological, and psychological data. The services provided will be writing novel applications as well as upgrading and management of existing applications facilitating electronic collection, review, and distribution of clinical data for the HANDLS study. At present, there are 12 applications in need of maintenance, and 4 applications to be written.<br />Additional services include design, testing, and implementation of applications to enhance functionality of existing applications. Maintenance, support, and extension of all deliverables are expected. Existing applications have been developed over time by a number of different developers. Current platforms include: Perl CGI, HTML::Template, PHP, PHP Smarty, all running on Apache Web Server on CentOS 5 Linux Servers with mod_cgi, mod_php, and mod_perl.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program has embarked on a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community-dwelling residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. This study, Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS), requires expertise in database management, web design, the connection between web interfaces and data, and application life-time development techniques. This expertise must include knowledge and experience with usability as measured by the fewest clicks to accomplish a task with the fewest (or no) errors. In addition, this expertise must include experience with re-usable application design such that programs written for the present wave of data collection can be modified easily for data collection in subsequent waves. Moreover, the design of the program must accommodate several goals, including comprehensive data collection, ease of navigation, and the capacity for direct transfer to other tools for statistical analyses. In order to facilitate agile development and ease of use, all programs are web based applications. These programs are specifically designed for ease of use to act as replacements for paper patient charts.</p>
<p>In addition to modifying existing web applications, expertise is required to complete the development of web-based data collection tools to support the clinical research conducted by the HANDLS study. The web-tool provides the ability to collect the clinical data in the mobile research vehicles and subsequently to upload the data to servers located in the Gerontology Research Center (GRC). This integrated web-based system requires ongoing maintenance and enhancements, as well as tools for monitoring performance, particularly disconnections. Moreover, these applications must account for security and confidentiality of the information and data collected, clinical informatics and database design that can be supported with open-source tools, and web applications that meet current design standards and accessibility requirements, including Section 508 for accessibility by individuals with disabilities.<br />Period of performance is 12 months with the option for up to 2 additional one-year option periods. The anticipated fixed price level of effort is 1,980 hours per annum. <br />Quotations are to be sent electronically by the due date and time to Susan Nsangou at nsangous@mail.nih.gov. <br />Quotations will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) ability to provide the services according to the functions described 2) understanding of the data collection needs as it relates to the study and population of the study; and 3) past performance (3 references within the last 3 years) Price will be evaluated on a best value basis.</p>
<p>Quotations are to be submitted electronically to nsangous@mail.nih.gov by the due date and time.</p>
<p>Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, with its offer (or state that an active provision is on BPN/ORCA.) Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Condition Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>

<p>POSITION TITLE: Senior Health Advisor</p>
<p>MARKET VALUE: GS-15 salary range ($98,156 - $127,604).</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/West Bank and Gaza Mission offices, <br />Tel Aviv, Israel</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years with a possible extension</p>
<p>POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR: The Senior Health Advisor will work under the general supervision and policy guidance of the USAID/West Bank and Gaza Office Director for Health and Humanitarian Assistance (HHA).</p>
<p>SECURITY ACCESS: Secret Clearance</p>
<p>AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens</p>
<p>MARKET VALUE: The market value for this PSC is equivalent to a GS-15 level. The salary range for a GS-15 level is $98,156 - $127,604. In addition, the Mission has a Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA) and Danger Pay. The salary will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history, and educational background.</p>
<p><br />A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>1. MISSION PROGRAM<br />USAID/West Bank and Gaza is at the core of U.S. Government engagement in the Middle East. In an extraordinarily complex political, policy, legal, and security operating environment, the Mission is committed to work towards the achievement of the U.S. foreign policy objective for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Through assistance activities in five technical areas --- Democracy and Governance, Education and Youth, Water Resources and Infrastructure, Private Enterprise, and Health and Humanitarian Assistance --- USAID is working with key stakeholders within the Palestinian Authority (PA) to help build the institutions of a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel. In addition, the Mission maintains a robust engagement with the non-governmental and private sectors to support diversity and quality in social sector services (health, education) and effective civil society engagement.</p>
<p>2. OFFICE OF HEALTH AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (HHA)<br />The Office of Health and Humanitarian Assistance (HHA) manages a portfolio valued at approximately $155.35 million that supports projects in Palestinian health sector reform, maternal and neonatal care, nutrition, and food assistance. The $85.4 million Palestinian Health Sector Reform and Development Project (the "Flagship Project") is the centerpiece of the Mission's commitment to developing Palestinian health institutions to meet the priority public health needs of the population. This five-year contract was awarded in September 2008. In order to provide an integrated package of development assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) Ministry of Health (MoH), eligible non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and health education institutions, activities under the Flagship Project are framed in three components: (1) health sector reform and management, (2) clinical and community-based health, and (3) procurement of health and humanitarian assistance commodities. Capacity-building activities for the MoH are being implemented based on the results of a participatory needs assessment conducted in November/December 2008 which have been incorporated into a five-year PA Institutional Development Work plan (IDP). The IDP serves as the strategic framework for Flagship Project interventions and includes a broad range of health sector reform initiatives including developing a new national health insurance program, creating a more transparent and cost-effective MoH procurement system, introducing a health facility accreditation program, institutionalizing quality improvement for better clinical and community-based health care services, and implementing a new health information system for better data management and decision-making. Technical priorities include maternal and child health, chronic diseases, emergency care, rehabilitation services, injury prevention, and behavior change communication.</p>
<p>The Mission also provides direct assistance to the Holy Family Hospital of Bethlehem, a center of excellence for maternal and neonatal care in the West Bank. Since 2005, USAID has partnered with the Hospital to further enhance its capacities to deliver top quality, state-of-the-art services, especially for high-risk mothers and newborns. This assistance amounts to $5.55 million. Current support includes short and long term specialty training for doctors, nurses, and midwives, continuing education programs such as Scientific Days and the Visiting Professor Program, plus expansion of the Well Woman and Outreach Clinic program.</p>
<p>Through USAID's Global Health A2Z Micronutrient Program, the Mission is supporting the Ministry of Health's capacity to develop, disseminate, and monitor compliance with national standards for micronutrient fortification. Activities include capacity-building for the MoH's Central Public Health Laboratory to collect samples of fortified food products and conduct quality control analyses to ensure compliance with national standards. Activities are coordinated with UNICEF and the World Food Program to ensure complementarity of interventions to improve the quality of fortified foods provided to the Palestinian population and address widespread micronutrient deficiencies, especially among young children and women of reproductive age.</p>
<p>Finally, the HHA portfolio includes a $62.275 million grant to the World Food Program to provide assistance to over $365,000 food insecure non-refugee beneficiaries in the West Bank and Gaza. The Mission's cash donation is complemented by $19.116 million donation of in-kind commodities from USAID/Washington's Food for Peace (FFP) Program in FY09. The bi-monthly food baskets include essential items such as fortified wheat flour, vegetable oil, chick peas, sugar, and salt. Beneficiary selection and food distribution is managed by U.S. NGOs working in partnership with WFP.</p>

The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as “Flight Critical” and ACMS Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote.  Evidence of other certifications, such as a DOD Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer.   Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair".  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the reparables.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. Contractor is to provide FAA Certifications or DOD certifications with their proposal.  The USCG, ALC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The following questions were asked and the answers are contained herein.  There is NOT an extention regarding the closing of this RFP as a result of this new information.

1) In regards to geometry, does the radome need to be cylindrical as shown in the sketch or will a spherical radome be acceptable?
 
RESPONSE:  It does not matter if the radome is cylindrical or spherical as long as it meets all environmental characteristics (i.e. wind, weather, rain shedding, lighting etc), Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics and specifications listed in the RFP.
 
 
2) Total height when the "rod" antenna is deployed is 17.75'.  What is the height of the overall structure when that antenna is in the stowed position (i.e. to the top of the rotating dish in Figure 3-2 of the RFP)?
 
RESPONSE:  Figure 3-2 in the RFP does not depict a complete stowed position.  In a complete stowed position not only does the PAR antenna (rod) fold down but also the ASR antenna (rotating dish) folds down to a stowed position.  The height of a complete stowed SYSTEM is 9'.  The height from the ground to the top of the ASR Antenna in figure 3-2 of the RFP is 16'.  Recommend a margin be developed around the system as it rolls in/out of the Radome, for example 4-feet.
 
3) Is a door that is created by removing multiple panels acceptable, or does the door have to be one single piece or roll-up?
 
RESPONSE:  Any one (1) of these options are acceptable as long as the door enables expeditious roll in / roll out capability as stated in the RFP section 3.2.2 Site Installation.  We believe it would be more suitable to have a roll up door vice de-construction the radome panels, especially wrt tools, lost hardware, time, and weight. 
 
4) Does the radome have to be 30' in diameter at the base, or can it be slightly smaller at the mounting points of the base (i.e. just under 25' dia), such that the maximum diameter at any point of the radome is then never greater than 30'?
 
RESPONSE:  RFP Figure 3-3 shows that with a radome with a 30' base diameter provides 10.625' on each side of the High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  This was requested in order to allow both the ASR enclosure door to be open, the PAR enclosure door to be open, and still allow an instructor and several students to move freely around the HMMWV.  With a base diameter of 25', this will allow ONLY 8.125' of clearance on either side of the HMMWV.  The ~8-foot clearance will NOT adequate based on human factors, the "internal" dimension of the Radome must not shrink beyond 30-feet (i.e., NLT 30-feet) at the base to support the acceptable guidelines. 
 
5)  In addition to the already specified frequency bands of operation for each antenna could we please get details on: the sizes, polarizations, and aperture illumination tapers of each?

RESPONSE: 
 
PAR: 
           Power: 1000W peak
           Polarization: Circular
                Azimuth Antenna
                      Beam Width Horizontal: 30 degrees
                      Beam Width Vertical: 9 degrees
                Elevation Antenna
                      Beam Width Horizontal: 16 degrees
                      Beam Width Vertical: 9 degrees

ASR: (360 degree rotation)
          Power: 650W peak
          Polarization: Linear Horizontal
          Beam Width Horizontal: 3.2 degrees
          Beam Width Vertical: 30 degrees
          
SSR: (360 degree rotation)
         Power: 200W peak
         Polarization: Linear Vertical
         Beam Width Horizontal: 6.4 degrees
         Beam Width Vertical: 60 degrees

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC><strong>DRAFT SOLICITATION QUESTIONS and ANSWERS</strong>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 1:</strong> Reference Section L.4.3. There is a reference to a form called Attachment L1. This attachment is not included as part of the draft. L-1 is critical to offerors ability to begin the development of our Past Performance section and having the template in advance of the final RFP will allow offerors to take advantage of the time between the draft RFP and final proposal submission to build our Past Performance responses using the Government directed format. Has this document been developed by the Government? If so we would request that the Government release it as soon as possible. <br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) Attachment L-1 is currently being tailored for this solicitation and will be made available on FedBizOps for all interested offerors as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 2:</strong> Are second-tier subcontractors permitted, and, if so, how will the size status of said 2nd-tier subcontractors affect the attainment of socioeconomic subcontracting goals?<br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em> Second-tier subcontractors are certainly permitted on DTRA contracting opportunities, but for the purpose of the subject solicitation they will not count toward a prime offeror's subcontracting/socio-economic goal. Offerors must note that the stated DTRA subcontracting/socio-economic goals are tied to the prime offeror through its first-tier subcontractors.</p>

<DESC>The new Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) will consist of a new high power, high energy neutrino beam situated at Fermilab (near Chicago, Illinois), a near detector located on the Fermilab site (Batavia, Illinois) to calibrate the beam of neutrinos near the source, and a very large detector located 1,000 to 2,000 km from the source. The far detector is planned to have an active volume of 300,000 tons of water, and it will be situated 1.5 km underground to reduce the backgrouind from cosmic rays that strike the Earth's surface. The far detector for the LBNE will be part of the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) at the old Homesake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota. The Water Containment Vessels (WCV) will be located 4,850 feet below ground and will be instrumented each with a large number of Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) or other appropriate light sensors as the active devices used to record physics events.<br /><br />The technical points to be addressed by respondents are as follows: 1) Photon detection efficency 2) Single photon response 3) Spurious signals 4) Electrical connection 5) Long term electrical stability 6) Mechanical robustness 7) Ultra-pure water compatibility 8) Testing 9) Safety 10) Manufacturing and delivery.<br /><br />Firms must have five (5) or more years experience in the deign and production of Photodetectors in order to respond to this Request for Information (RFI).<br /><br />The example in the RFI is for ~67,000 PMTs per cavity and with three (3) cavities, the total quantity is approximately 201,000 PMTs.&nbsp; Again, this is only an example but not the exact number at this time.<br /><br />Please contact Robert F. Cibic at <a href="mailto:bcibic@fnal.gov">bcibic@fnal.gov</a> or (630) 840-3528 if your firm intends on responding to this RFI.

<DESC>Recovery Project Site Viewing, Anthony Lakes Highway Road 73 Reconstruction, 
Wallowa-Whitman NF

Draft Project Overview

The following project description will, most definitely, change between now and when the solicitation is advertised, but due to the season in which this solicitation will be advertised, this project is being announced so that potential offerors may visit the site and ensure conditions are seen before the snow covers the project area.  

There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will a Forest Service employee be available to accompany prospective bidders to the site. However, bidders are reminded that is is their responsiblity to determine for themselves the actual site conditions and only by physical inspection, on-the-ground viewing can offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions. Maps are available at the Whitman Ranger District office. Thank you.

The set aside has not been determined.

The Anthony Lakes Highway project is approximately 10 miles long, and is one of the higher standard paved roads on the Forest.  The project requires, but is not limited to construction staking, clearing and grubbing, slope rounding, excavation, slope scaling, drainage structures, culverts, geo-textile, riprap, aggregate, pit development, asphalt re-surfacing, hydro seeding and mulching, signs, and temporary traffic control.  In addition, there are utilities buried in the road that need to be protected.

The project is divided into four (4) segments.  Segment “A” (6.13 mi.) requires crack sealing, and a chip seal over the existing asphalt surface.  Segment “B” (2.55 mi.) requires pulverizing the existing asphalt, adding base aggregate and repaving with new hot mix asphalt.  Segment “C” (0.21 mi.) requires sub-excavating the road and replacing the road structure with geo-textile material, base and surface aggregate, and repaving with hot mix asphalt.  Segment “D” (0.60 mi.) also requires crack sealing and a chip seal.

There are four (4) design sections that will address cut slope stabilization.  These sections target cut slopes by either benching the existing slope or reconstructing the cut slope to a gentler ratio.  The remaining cut slope stabilization sections will be addressed by slope scaling.

Excavation from the design sections, slope scaling sections, and slope rounding will be utilized in the Anthony Lakes Ski Run parking lot expansion (Sta. 477+50), and the Anthony Snow Park parking lot expansion (Sta. 513+80).  Stump disposal, wood chip, and excavation waste area are located on Rd. 7300140 (Sta. 440+97).  Additional alternative excavation waste areas may be utilized at (Sta. 509+00), and Anthony Lakes Ski Run “bunny hill” re-contouring (Sta. 484+50) if needed.

To further stabilize the cut slopes, hydro seeding, and wood chip mulch will be placed on the cut slopes to provide erosion control.

The project may be reached starting from Baker City, Oregon by traveling NW on State Hwy. 30 approximately 9 miles to Haines, Oregon. Then travel West on County Road 1124 approximately 15 miles to the beginning of the Anthony Lakes Highway Reconstruction Project at Forest Boundary. 

Thank you

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:  1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php. 2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>Recovery - Compact, High PFR, Wavelength-Controlled, Micropulse MOPA Laser SystemBrassboard This synopsis is being provided for information purposes only.	NASA Goddard has selectedFibertek Inc for the Laser Systems Engineering Services (LSES) contract, NNG09CP09C. This is an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Cost-Plus Award Fee contract valued at$35 million. The period of performance is five years. The NAICS Code is 336419 and theSize Standard is 1,000 employees.  The value of Task Order #3 is $2,159,110. The period of performance is December 7, 2009to 31 October 2010.  NASA Goddard awarded Task Order #3 to contract NNG09CP09C, IAW the American Recovery andReinvestment Act of 2009, PL 111-5. Task order #3 is Compact, High PFR,Wavelength-Controlled, Micropulse MOPA Laser System Brassboard. The scope of task order #3 is the ICESat-2 Project is baselining a multiple ground-spot,micropulse laser measurement approach for ranging to collect data on the topography ofice sheets and the thickness characteristics of sea ice. As such, the Project requires alaser transmitter that is suited for such an application. This task is a follow-on toLSES Task 001 (Compact, High PRF (Pulse Repetition Frequency) Laser OscillatorBreadboard) and involves designing, building, demonstrating and delivering a complete,compact, high-repetition rate, wavelength-controlled micropulse Master Oscillator PowerAmplifier (MOPA) laser system brassboard.  In this context, a laser brassboard isessentially a packaged breadboard in which the optomechanical laser design has evolvedfrom the breadboard phase into a customized package.  A laser brassboard is anintermediate design between a true laser breadboard (that may include off-the-shelfoptomechanical parts) and a fully tested, customized TRL 6 laser prototype. The startingpoint for this work should be the oscillator development under LSES Task 001.  From this,the next steps are to incorporate wavelength control and amplification.  The targetperformance goals for the micropulse MOPA laser system brassboard developed in this taskare listed in the table below.	These correspond to the performance parameters describedin the ATLAS Laser Performance Specification that is currently in the approval processunder the ICESat-2/ATLAS Configuration Management (CM) system.	Most of the work isexpected to be performed at the contractor's facility.This document and any other related documents to this procurement will be available overthe Internet.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) -Iowa City, is soliciting and intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Architecture/Engineering (A/E) services, "A/E Relocate Surgical Operating Rooms" at the VAMC in Iowa City, IA.  NAICS Code 541310, size standard $4.5 million.  The A/E contract will include investigative services for structural feasibility and services for complete design including architectural, structural, mechanical, and electrical systems (with reviews); reproduction of design documents; construction period services; final inspections and as-built drawings.  The services of a third party Fire Protection Engineer will also be required.  This project will create a new Surgical Operating Suite at this medical center to replace an aging and outdated surgical operating suite, which is now in use.  The new Surgical Operating Suite would cover approximately 14,000 gross square feet and be constructed above the third floor of the existing clinical addition which was constructed in the 1980's (this will result in new construction, there is no existing space there currently).  It would also include the renovation of approximately 3,000 gross square feet of adjacent area.  These are estimates only and may be adjusted to provide more new construction and less renovation as program criteria are finalized.  Construction will require phasing to maintain access to occupied areas. The estimated construction cost range is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  Area of consideration: Firms must be within a 300 mile radius of the VAMC, 601 Highway 6 West, Iowa City, IA 52246.

<DESC>Key Dates<br />Release Date: December 9, 2009<br />Response Date:  January 15, 2010<br />Issued by<br />Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) (http://www.nichd.nih.gov) <br />Purpose<br />This is a time-sensitive Request for Information that will be used to assess the need to perform pediatric labeling studies of ketamine for short term procedures performed in the Emergency Department.<br />"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only." <br />Background<br />The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) legislation enacted in 2002 (renewed in 2007), directs the (NIH) in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of "off-patent" drugs for which pediatric studies are most urgently needed. <br />Ketamine has become one of the most favored drugs used by emergency physicians for sedation of children in the Emergency Department. Despite its extensive use, ketamine is not labeled in pediatrics by the Food and Drug Administration. Ketamine has been prioritized for study by NICHD under BPCA since February 2004.<br /> Recently, concerns have arisen about the safety of ketamine due to the appearance of proapoptopic effects in the developing central nervous system in young experimental animals.  Neuro-apoptosis have been demonstrated in rodents and non-human primates at doses several fold higher that those used in children. Additionally, in young experimental animals neuro-apoptotic lesions have been associated with long term behavioral deficits.<br />Information Requested<br />The NIH is especially interested in concrete and relevant suggestions to the following questions in order to determine the scientific and regulatory need to sponsor clinical drug studies on the pediatric use of ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Room. <br />Questions<br />1.	Are there sufficient data to assess the neurotoxicity of single exposure to ketamine?  To what extent is the dose(s) used in nonclinical studies relevant to the exposure levels used in ER departments to achieve sedation and analgesia for short-term procedures?
<p>2.	Are the data on the dosage of ketamine in experimental young animals applicable to children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Department?</p>
<p>3.    The vulnerability period for the development of neuroapoptosis lesions after ketamine exposure spans from the third trimester of pregnancy to approximately 3 years of age; however the drug is most commonly used in the ER in children 3 years and older. Could labeling studies be safely be performed in children between 3 and 12 years of age? <br />4.   Are data on the pharmacodynamics of ketamine in experimental animals applicable to human study designs? Conversely, are there issues in experimental studies that need to be considered in the design of pediatric studies?<br />5.  Considering the large inter-individual variability in the metabolism of ketamine, should studies be performed to analyze the effects of polymorphisms (CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and ontogeny (CYP2C9) of the ketamine-metabolizing enzymes in  pharmacokinetics and adverse events?<br />6.  If a two phased study ( i.e., pharmacokinetics and or pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study followed by an efficacy and safety clinical study) is requested,  which pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  measurements and efficacy and safety endpoints should be included?<br />7.  Considering that racemic ketamine is used in the United States, should PK studies include measurements of ketamine enatiometers?<br />8.  How should the study population of children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the ER    be defined?<br /> How to Submit a Response</p>
