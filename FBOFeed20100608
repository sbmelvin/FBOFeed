<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center- Washington on the behalf of the Research, Development and Engineering (RDECOM), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division proposes a non-competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract with Applied Research Associates (ARA), Inc. Albuquerque, NM for the purpose of providing improvements to their existing Advanced Demining Technology Prototype Systems, testing of these improvements and to develop two new prototypes.<BR><BR>The proposed effort will build upon the designs of the previously ARA developed prototypes and is expected to result in improvements in landmine and UXO probability of detection while reducing system false alarm rates.  Improvements to the robotic control systems and operator control stations for these prototype systems will be made under this effort with the overall goal of reducing cost and size while improving performance, reliability and operability of the systems.  Additional focus will be placed on improving the reliability and maintainability of the prototype systems to prepare for field operations in live minefield and UXO-contaminated sites overseas.  New system developments under this effort will include a smaller all-terrain robotic platform integrated with the dual-sensor detection system from the Nemesis prototype for off-road detection of landmines, and a minefield management software tool for planning, executing and recording data from minefield clearance tasks.  The proposed effort will also include logistical support for testing and evaluation of the Advanced Demining Technology Systems at Government test sites both within the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).<BR><BR>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal and does not constitute a solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Medtronic, Inc. 710 Medtroic Parkway NE, Minneapolis MN 55432-5604, as the only responsible source that can provide an ENT stereotactic navigation system for Naval Hospital Bremerton.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.

NH Bremerton has a requirement for an ENT stereotactic navigation system.  The system shall include a navigation system, ENT system software, and scanner interface.  The system shall include electromagnetic tracking for use in ENT cases (tracking up to 3 instruments at a time). The system shall have 1GB RAM and an 80 GB hard drive. The system shall allow tracking via navigation sinus shaver blades.  The system shall allow for the retainment of multiple physician preferences. The system shall be DICOM compatible.  The system shall work with standard size reusable instruments.  The voltage requirements are 120V, 60Hz, and single phase.

The Fusion ENT System manufactured by Medtronic is the only system that meets the minimum requirements of the government.  This system is the only ENT stereotactic navigation system that can provide electromagnetic tracking, which allows the physician to track the tip of the instrument (catheter) instead of just targeting the navigation spot of interest.  This technology also eliminates all line of site issues that can occur with typical optical (infra-red) navigation systems of the past due to interruptions in procedures.  Line of site (space between the camera and headframe on all optical systems) can cause significant challenges during critical points in the surgery because if anything gets in the line of site between the camera and headframe, the system will not work or not track.  These line of site issues can cause the surgery to be twice as long and can also result in incomplete information to the surgeons when they need it most, ultimately delaying care to the patient.  No other ENT stereotactic navigation system has electromagnetic tracking, which completely eliminates all line of site issues because it creates an invisible field around the patient so that as soon as the navigation tool enters that field the system is tracking with no interruption.  

This is also the only ENT navigation system on the market that can retain each surgeons software preferences to allow for an increased throughput in the operating environment.  Also this is the only system that allows the surgeon to ENT track via navigation sinus shaver blades, permitting for shorter surgery times and increased safety to the patient.  This technology allows for sinus changes to be made right away during the navigation procedure instead of coming back later to cut or shave an area in the sinus cavity.


Items being purchased in this acquisition:
ENT Navigation System (1)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Medtronic, Inc.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Courtney Piar at Courtney.piar@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Courtney Piar. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 15 June 2010. No phone calls accepted.

The Naval Sea Systems Command Advanced Development Office for Undersea Warfare (formerly Advanced Systems and Technology Office or ASTO) within the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) hereby solicits proposals for research interests in advanced undersea technologies in the areas of processing, organic and distributed sensors.  This BAA will be open for a period of one (1) year through 07 June 2011.  The Navy's primary objective for this BAA is the acquisition of basic and applied research for the development of capabilities in the following areas: Signal Processing Technologies in support of Submarine Combat Systems; Signal Processing Technologies in support of Surface Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems; and Undersea Sensor, Handling and Communication Technologies.  A two-phased (Phase I and Phase II) proposal selection process will be utilized under this BAA.  This approach will save the Navy and offerors considerable expense by not requiring development of full-scale proposals unless necessary and desired by the Navy.  Phase I will invite offerors to submit White Papers describing technical approach, experience, capabilities and past performance with a cost estimate in the selected technology improvement areas.  The selection of White Papers to continue through to Phase II of this process will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost estimates provided in the White Papers, in view of the availability of funds.  The complete BAA including preparation instructions, technical point of contact, and evaluation criteria are found in the attachment.

<DESC>The Corporation for National and Community Service, a wholly owned Government Corporation intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor to provide the administration of its child care benefits for AmeriCorps*VISTA and AmeriCorps*National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) programs. Each year some 6,000 members serve in AmeriCorps*VISTA and some 1,100 members serve in AmeriCorps*NCCC.  Each month approximately 190 members of VISTA qualify for this benefit.  Fewer than 5 members a year in NCCC qualify for this benefit.  The payment for child care is paid directly to the provider. The payment is determined by an analysis of the rates prevailing in the state in which the service is provided and by the maximum benefit available; the maximum for AmeriCorps*VISTA is $300 per month and the maximum for AmeriCorps*NCCC is $400 per month.  The individual states determine a prevailing rate by a survey in compliance with the Department of Health & Human Services Child Care & Development Fund Block Grant program.  Demonstrable experience with the Child Care & Development Fund Block Grant program is required to administer this program and this experience is subject to validation.  Only those organizations with demonstrated experience with the Child Care & Development Fund Block Grant program and experience with the administration of government programs need apply. It is estimated that the hard copy of the solicitation will be available on or before July 11, 2006.  All requests for a copy of the solicitation must be in writing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center intends to award noncompetitive purchase order to Conservation Canines, Center for Conservation Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, to perform scent surveys for a sampling study of the Pacific Pocket Mouse (PPM) on/near Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA.  The USGS is committed to designing a long-term monitoring program for the critically endangered Pacific Pocket Mouse.  Three handlers with dogs trained to differentiate PPM scat from that of other rodents will survey all PPM habitat for two weeks in June or early July.  The goal is to set up 40 tracking tube scent detection arrays for each 1-2 week period.  Tracking tubes will be used to evaluate the general effect of scent, although results should be relevant for live-traps as well.  The overall goal of this program is to track trends of the PPM populations over a fairly large spatial area on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.
Conservation Canines is uniquely qualified to conduct canine scent surveys for a sampling study of the Pacific Pocket Mouse (PPM).  PPM are the smallest animals to ever be tested using these methodologies. The Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington developed the scat detection dog program in 1997.  Having pioneered the development and application of many of the fecal-based hormone and genetic techniques widely used today, Conservation Canines realized the need for a sampling method that would increase sample acquisition over large remote areas, while reducing bias associated with unequal capture probabilities common with other sampling techniques.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), other responsible sources that believe they can meet the requirement described above may submit a capability statement no later than the closing date of this announcement, which will be considered by the USGS.  This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-41, effective 13 May 2010. 
For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer, Sasha Klingler, by email at sklingler@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, in support of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is currently seeking qualified sources that currently sell and/or use the hammermill process to deconstruct sheeted cotton linters, preferably processes that are currently a part of nitrocellulose (NC) production. The main ingredient in combustible cases and mortar enclosure tabs is NC and is currently made with baled cotton linters as the raw material. Domestic sources of baled cotton linters have switched to producing sheeted cotton linters for ease of transportation and logistics. As a result, domestic sources of baled cotton linters have ceased production, leaving sheeted cotton linters as the only available form of domestic cotton linters. With the inevitable disruption of baled cotton linter availability, high grade NC production will be in jeopardy, affecting charge and propellant production for many mission critical systems and putting the Warfighter in unnecessary risk.  In preparation for the NC production process, the cotton linters need to be deconstructed (i.e. broken apart into loose fibers).  The purpose of this deconstruction is to ensure that the NC product is free of agglomerates and is suitable for use in the production of combustible ordinance items. Baled cotton linters tend to be less dense and airy, which led to easier and more consistent deconstructions. Due to the compression of the material, deconstruction of sheeted cotton linters have consistently resulted in agglomerates, which has lead to decrease ballistic and safety performance. Several industries/companies use a hammer-mill system which may deconstruct sheeted cotton linters more effectively and uniformly, which will reduce internal defects and allows the production of combustible ordinance that meets ballistic and safety requirements. 
Any and/or all information submitted should reflect that your company currently sells and/or uses the hammermill process to deconstruct sheeted cotton linters, preferably as part of nitrocellulose production. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government, all information as provided will not be returned. Firms that either sell and/or use the hammermill process to deconstruct sheeted cotton linters should provide a summary of their companys capabilities including a description of their facilities, personnel and past experience to meet this requirement via email no later than 18 June 2010. TELEPHONE INQUIREIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email. 
The Point of Contact for this action is Jennifer Hughes, Contract Specialist, CCJM-CA, (973) 724-4856.Email your questions to Jennifer Hughes at jennifer.hughes14@us.army.mil.
This is a Sources Sought/Market Survey Announcement only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey. As a result of the findings from this announcement should the U.S. Government decide to solicit for this effort a formal solicitation notice will be published at a later date with more detailed technical requirements provided.

<DESC>This is an 8(a) and Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) sources and Small Business; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered an 8(a) and Small Business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
<p>Background</p>
<p>Section 4202 subsection (b) of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct an evaluation of the impacts of community-based prevention and wellness programs on Medicare beneficiaries. As set forth in the statute, the intent of this evaluation is to determine whether and how these programs 1) reduce beneficiary health risks, 2) improve health outcomes, 3) promote healthy behaviors, 4) improve disease management skills and practices, and 5) reduce the utilization of health services and the costs associated with them. The evaluation shall consist of an evidence review and an independent evaluation of existing evidence-based community prevention and wellness programs. Specifically, the evidence review will examine programs sponsored by the Administration on Aging (AoA) and possibly other outreach groups that are designed to address physical activity, nutrition, obesity, falls, chronic disease self-management, and mental health.</p>
<p>The potential programs to come under this provision are numerous. The AoA is currently sponsoring 13 different community based interventions programs in 47 states. The scope and maturity of the programs being implemented vary state to state and site to site. Some programs such as the Chronic Disease Self Management Program have a broad focus and are being widely implemented. Other programs, such those surrounding the management of depression, have a much more narrow focus and more limited implementation Data collection for these programs will also vary by program and site. In order to conduct an effective evaluation, it is important to understand the scope and intricacies of the implementation of the programs and what beneficiary level data could be feasibly collected and made available to evaluators in the context of the specific programs.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of programs and scope of some of the individual programs, CMS anticipates a two-phase evaluation approach. In the first phase, CMS will work with a contractor to 1) conduct an environmental scan of all of the potential programs to be evaluated under this provision, 2) to conduct an extensive and exhaustive review of the literature surrounding community-based wellness and prevention programs, including evidence of their effectiveness and factors surrounding their implementation, 3) to synthesize these findings into a final report to CMS, and 4) to help CMS plan key elements of the evaluation study that will be implemented in phase 2. In the second phase, CMS anticipates on awarding a separate contract to implement the evaluation study and report the results.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1) THE AWARDEE OF PHASE 1 WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PHASE 2.</p>
<p>2) MAJOR PORTION OF THE EFFORT WILL NEED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF THE PROJECT.<br />Purpose of Action</p>
<p>The purpose of this action is to implement the first phase of the evaluation as outlined above. <br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the period of performance will be 12 months in duration. However, some critical deliverables will be due within 6 months of the award in order to accommodate the start of the second phase of the evaluation. The target start date for the project will be October 2010. Work on the project needs to be completed by October 2011.<br />Response Requested</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is exploring sources, on behalf of the Social Science Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a Performance Measure Studies, Well-Being Analysis, Community Cluster Analysis and Social Indicators Study: Improving the Conduct of Social Impact Assessments (SIAS) in the Northeast Region.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Part one: There is a need to develop performance measures for fisheries. One part of this is creating qualitative and quantitative measures of social well-being and job satisfaction. The SIA Conceptual Model (Pollnac et al. 2006[2008]) uses well-being as the composite social indicator for showing positive or negative outcomes from policy and other events. One key aspect of well-being is job satisfaction (Pollnac and Ru&iacute;z-Stout 1977; Pollnac and Poggie 1988, 2006, 2008; Pollnac et al. 2001; Pollnac et al. 2006[2008]; Westwood 2008). An in-person survey of well-being, job satisfaction and sector participation of individual and former fishermen and vessel owners is already underway in New England, along with the collection of an associated subset of oral histories designed to assess fishing family, household and community well-being (re. Colburn and Clay 2009). This proposal intends to build upon the experience with the stated project to further streamline and fine tune the survey and associated oral histories and then implement them in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>Further, any performance measures developed must have industry buy-in if they are to be effectively used in analyzing and arguing for or against specific management measures (Hartley and Robertson 2006, Kaplan and McCay 2004). A project conducted by the Gulf of Maine Research institute through a CINAR grant has already assessed New England industry views of NEFSC's newly proposed social and economic performance measures. The addition of selected questions to the well-being survey will allow a parallel assessment of industry views in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>Part 2: In related background, at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) we have profiled 177 communities from Maine through North Carolina (Clay et al. 2008; Colburn et al. In prep.). As a foundation for the Northeast profiles, we created the Social Science Database (SSD). It combines several NMFS Northeast data sets, including landings and value, permit, and processing data, with US Census data. The SSD includes all communities that appeared in the NMFS databases for any year between 1997 and 2006. This encompassed 1,835 communities from which the 177 were chosen for profiling based on a set of seven indicators (Colburn et al. In prep.). Based on the full SSD, taxonomy of fishing communities was developed using multivariate analysis (Smith et al. In prep.). This reduced the original 1,835 individual communities to forty clusters of communities manifesting similar characteristics. In terms of SIA, this method makes it possible to narrow in on key characteristics of sub-sets of communities within clusters and winnow down the number of communities for which in-depth analysis is needed. This proposal calls for additional analyses to create sub-taxonomies of communities based on their relative dependence on specific species belonging to each Northeast Fishery Management Plan (FMP). This should further facilitate rapid yet scientifically defensible selection of subsets of communities for targeting in SIAs.</p>
<p>Part 3: Building further on the SSD, a project to develop quantitative social indicators of sustainability and resilience/vulnerability for coastal fishing communities is being jointly funded by the Northeast and Southeast Regions. These indicators will be constructed using secondary data. NOAA is concerned with "risks to sustainability" of fishing communities (Draft NOAA Catch Share Policy, retrieved at: http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/domes_fish/catchshare/docs/draft_noaa_cs_policy.pdf (accessed 23 March 2010), p. 6) and recent fall 2009 Northeast and National workshops on social and economic performance measures for catch shares have highlighted the area of resilience/vulnerability as critical. Mike Jepson (of the Southeast Regional Office) and Steve Jacobs have done a considerable amount of work on social indicators of this sort based on secondary data (Jacob et al. In prep.; Jacob and Jepson 2009; Jepson and Jacob 2007). Lisa Colburn of NEFSC has been working on issues of gentrification in coastal communities since 2004 (Colburn 2007a, 2007b) and in the summer of 2008 hired a Hollings student who began work on gentrification indices based on secondary data. This proposal is a cooperative effort with the Southeast Region that will enable more objective inter- and intra-regional analysis of social impacts.</p>
<p>Primary Objectives:<br />(a) The core of the in-person survey of well-being, job satisfaction and sector participation of individual and former fishermen and vessel owners for the Mid-Atlantic would remain identical to the current New England version, thus allowing it to be part of the time series that these two baseline efforts will begin. The Mid-Atlantic survey, as the New England one, will be accompanied by carefully associated oral histories to capture the fishing family, household and community aspects of well-being not covered in the survey of individual and former fishermen and vessel owners.</p>
<p>In addition, because this will be a streamlined version of the New England survey (which already asks some management and sector-specific questions), it will be possible to add some additional questions relative to key fishery performance measures as viewed by industry members - while still keeping the survey to approximately 30 minutes. This section of the survey would parallel an industry outreach effort on fishery performance measures that was completed in New England in April 2010 by the Gulf of Maine Research institute (GMRI) under a CINAR grant.</p>
<p>(b) An updated run will be conducted of the original overall cluster analysis of all Northeast Region communities in the latest version of the SSD. Following on from this separate runs will be conducted on sub-sets of communities that are associated with each of the current Northeast Region FMPs.</p>
<p>(c) A standardized set of social indicators to measure resilience/vulnerability, sustainability and other indicators (e.g., gentrification) in the Northeast will be developed that is complementary to such a dataset for the Southeast, and actual indicators will be created and analyzed.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is exploring sources, on behalf of the Fisheries Field Station of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a Tagging Unit and Elastomer Injection System.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Penobscot River population has been identified as requiring research comparing the survival of Salmon; from two different stocks. From 2000 to 2010, NOAA Fisheries personnel have marked over 2,000,000 Atlantic Salmon Smolts using this equipment and it is critical to maintain constant marking techniques during the eleventh year of this multi-year study. Obtaining accurate information of group marked fish is a critical research need, and the equipment outlined in this requisition has been used successfully by NMFS and USFWS researchers in the past to mark large numbers of Atlantic salmon.</p>
<p>Primary Objective:<br />To facilitate the marking of Atlantic Salmon Parr and Smolts for release in Maine's rivers; state-of-the- art marking techniques are needed. Numerous studies have been conducted with elastomer and coded wire tags that indicate good tag retention and very low tagging mortality rates.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />(a) Ability to mark/tag fish between 90-190 mm; (b) Ability to recover marks after 2 years at sea without sacrificing or injuring the fish, while maintaining tagging rates of at least 300 fish per hour; and (c) Compatible with existing NWMT equipment (detection lights, MKIV tagging units, air-driven elastomer injection systems and elastomer tokens) that is currently owned and used by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center.</p>
<p>The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>Potential Respondents shall describe how they would propose to successfully perform these services, assuming that all services provided by Respondent would be accomplished in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.</p>
<p>Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the cost estimates provided as a result of this request are "best" estimates only.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL on a sole source basis with L-3 Communications Corporation. The government intends to acquire the supplies under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to L-3 Communications Corporation for the PVI-600 multi-function displays.
<p>The PVI-600 multi-function display is a critical component of the safety systems portion of the avionics on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft. This acquisition is for additional units to be installed on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft and/or used as a spare for existing PVI-600 applications. AOC believes there to be no alternate FAA certified part available meeting their system interface requirements.</p>
<p>The initial selection of the PVI-600 for installation in the NOAA P-3 aircraft was performed in 2005, following an extensive industry search. Since then, the PVI-600 has been engineered into a certified aircraft design on the NOAA P-3 aircraft. Any unit other than the PVI-600 would require extensive re-engineering and recertification, and thus would not be cost effective.</p>
<p>This is a small purchase acquisition over $25,000.00. The delivery of the PVI-600 multi-function display is required within 30 calendar days from the date of award.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government. Responses can be faxed to Sharon Clisso at (816) 274-6816 or sent via email to Sharon.Clisso@noaa.gov. A determination by the government not to compete the acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>DOC, ERAD-Kansas City requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations and Certifications at http://ORCA.BPN.GOV.</p>

<DESC>The National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) in Norman, Oklahoma intends to negotiate with only one source, Lockheed Martin Corporation located in Moorestown, New Jersey for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) engineering, technical and computer support maintenance services for the SPY-1A phased array radar to include technical and computer program support services in troubleshooting, repairing, and testing of SPY-1A and related equipment system interfaces to facilitate NSSL operations and testing efforts; equipment maintenance; configuration management support, and training for SPY-1A equipment operation and casualty recovery. The NSSL and a consortium of ten organizations, including the FAA, Department of Navy, and the University of Oklahoma constructed the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT) in Norman, Oklahoma to adapt and develop the phased array radar for weather applications. For its part, the US Navy loaned a battle spare SPY-1A phased array radar to the NSSL. The SPY-1A technology was obtained for the NWRT because of the ability for rapid scans. It is anticipated that adapting this technology for weather purposes can increase warning times by as much as 70 percent. Using multiple beams and frequencies that are controlled electronically, the SPY-1A's phased array radar reduces the scan time of severe weather from six minutes for NEXRAD radar to only one minute. Per the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Navy and the FAA, NOAA is required to maintain the radar in good battle ready operating condition for the duration of the loan. In order to maintain the equipment in this battle ready state and meet the requirements of the MOA, maintenance services and replacement parts are required from Lockheed Martin. As the original SPY-1A equipment designer and manufacturer for the Navy, Lockheed Martin has extensive experience and background in the design/development, production and integration, operation and maintenance for the SPY-1A radar. They are also the only known manufacturer of the parts for the SPY-1A radar and the only one capable of providing the spare parts. The SPY-1A equipment and technology is proprietary only to Lockheed Martin, which was developed and engineered for the Navy. Due to the unique capability of Lockheed Martin to provide the needed services and supplies in support of the continued operation of the SPY-1A in NWRT, there is no other one responsible source other than Lockheed Martin. NSSL's agreement to maintain the system in battle readiness requires contract support services from Lockheed Martin. The proposed contract is for a one-year period. This notice represents the only official notice of a solicitation.

<DESC>Introduction
This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Use the Patient's Picture Innovation # 214.  
Background
The Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system, Computer Patient Record System (CPRS), is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Despite migration to a graphical interface over a decade ago, CPRS is largely a text-based record system.  VA desires to show the patients photo on every CPRS page, an innovation that would:
1.	Decrease the rate of errors associated with choosing the wrong patient's record 
2.	Be a visual reminder of the need to re-personalize our medical practice
3.	Embody the principle of patient-centered care as a core value of our organization
VA's VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  
Requirements
VA requires that the patient's photo be prominently displayed at the "center" of the CPRS face page whenever a new patient is selected.  Health care providers would have the option for the picture to fade away after 6 seconds, or remain on the page.  On subsequent CPRS screens the patient's photo would appear as a small (thumbnail) image on the menu bar.  
All patients accessing VHA services have their photo taken as a registration requirement, and most patients have been photographed or re-photographed within the past 4 years.  These photos reside in the VistA imaging application.  In this RFI we are seeking a middleware solution that would allow VistA client programs (CPRS or other programs) to exchange the photo via web services from the VistA imaging application.  The VistA imaging team has made some progress in this direction using the VIX solution.  In addition, there are two other locally developed solutions that are in use at two VA medical centers.  It is VA's intent to review these three alternative solutions (the already developed local solutions, the solution proposed by the VistA Imaging team, and the contract proposal) to select one for the development of a prototype that will meet VA enterprise wide deployment requirements.  It is this prototype that VA is researching for qualified contractors in response to the Request for Information.
Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.
1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.
2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Responses are requested no later than close of business on June 11, 2010 with an extended date of June 16, 2010, via email to  sarah.basilotto@va.gov and anne.vasconcelos@va.gov.

<DESC>Introduction

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Creating Custom Reports for Quality Control and Patient-Oriented Research in CPRS, Innovation # 226 VHA/OI&T II.  

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.   VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide.   The VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system, Computer Patient Record System (CPRS), Quality Control is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.

Currently, the VA's ability to conduct quality control and, or implement quality improvement on the  management and adequacy of common medical conditions requires generation of multiple patient lists with target diagnoses from VistA, and a separate review of each patient's CPRS file for manual extraction of relevant information.  This process is unnecessarily time consuming.  Additionally, the inappropriate use of medications such as, antimicrobials is costly and is linked with increased mortality.  Currently, monitoring (stewardship) the use of antimicrobials is hampered because of the lack of an automated detection process for the inappropriate use of medications.  CPRS has the potential to solve both of these problems: 

1.	Creating an associated Graphical User Interface (GUI) application running queries 

2.	Generating datasets with patient lists populated with all variables of interest

VA's VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements

VA is seeking a GUI program (prototype) to run queries that will identify 1) patients with a specified diagnosis, 2) patients receiving a specified therapy, and 3) generate customized patient reports that will include demographic, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data for each patient.  VA wants the opportunity in this prototype to create the ability to quickly conduct quality control and, or improvement investigations that will significantly improve patient outcomes and lead to a quick identification of quality deficiencies and implement corrective measures, such as:

a.	Automatic extraction of antimicrobial use and microbiologic data will for instance allow immediate identification of potential problems (bug/drug mismatches; dosing inadequacies; contra-indications).

b.	Allow targeted interventions: elimination of unnecessary isolation, antibiotherapy discontinuation and cost-saving

c.	Tracking of prevalence and spread of multidrug resistant organisms like MRSA  by identification and display of patients, hospital wards, time, providers, and other exposures noted in CPRS charts

VA desires the creation of GUI-based applications to perform the following functions on multiple patients:

"	Query VistA and create a customized list of patients with a specific diagnosis using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm

"	For each patient, retrieve from VistA the date and results of selected laboratory data, pharmacy data e.g., start and stop date of medications received, hospital ward location and duration of stay

"	Create Access or Excel spreadsheets with generated information

This will allow VA's health care providers a quick review of information such as:

"	Frequency of admissions and, or readmissions for a given condition

"	Ensure adequacy of patient management and compliance with guidelines, and whether this affects outcomes

"	Early detection, and localization of spread of drug resistant organisms 

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Responses are requested no later than close of business on June 16, 2010, via email to matthew.truex@va.gov and anne.vasconcelos@va.gov.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Mental Health Primary Care Integration - Behavioral Health Lab (253 -VHA/OI&T I.  

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic health record system, Computer Patient Record System (CPRS), Mental Health Primary Care Integration is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   

VA's goal for "evidence base" primary care management and preventative programs for depression, anxiety, pain and alcohol abuse recently led to a VA initiative that will reach out to a population-level to address common behavioral health needs in a primary care setting. These care management and preventative programs are being implemented in VAs nationally; however, without technological tools to effectively and efficiently provide this care to patients.

CPRS does not allow decision support at the point of care nor does it have practical patient tracking features.  The VA developed software, Behavioral Health Laboratory (BHL) is utilized at a myriad of VA medical centers to provide tracking and clinical support functions; however, its major limitation is that it currently does not interface with CPRS.
VA's VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.

Requirements

VA wants an interface between BHL and CPRS so that mental health assessment data is instantly available in the medical record and patients will not need to be registered separately in the software.  VA believes that the integration of BHL with CPRS will substantially improve the efficiency of the patient's care management staff and provide a direct benefit to VA health care providers and patients, such as: 

"	Mental health outcome data will be accessible to health care providers
"	Increase collaboration between the health care providers and care management staff for well-informed treatment planning
"	Mental health staff will work efficiently, reduce data entry errors, and improve patient's clinical outcomes in a primary care setting. 

Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information by June 11, 2010 with an extended date of June 16, 2010. 
1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.
2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

<DESC>Introduction
This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Veterans on Line Tracking of Mail Prescription Delivery System enhancement # 254.  
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The Veterans on Line Tracking of Mail Prescription Delivery is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, the VA sends the majority of outpatient prescription medications to the Veterans (patients) through the United States postal system.  In order for VA's patients to track the delivery of their mailed medications they must telephone their local VA Medical Center.  This results in an increase number of telephone calls to pharmacy staff and decreases patient satisfaction.  Provision of an on line tracking functionality will improve care quality, efficiency, patient access and satisfaction.
VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  
Requirements
VA intends to create an enhancement to the VA's web based portal, My HealtheVet, for patients to use when accessing their personal health information, ordering refills of medications, and communicating with VHA's health care providers.  
This functional prototype will display a link within the My HealtheVet portal to permit patient's to access tracking information for their pharmaceutical mail out package that is available from the VA's Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacies (CMOP).  CMOP will provide a web service that will pass to the My HealtheVet portal the patient's tracking information and will be displayed to the patient upon request.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for the production of a functional prototype adding a search function to additional areas of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). #259

Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The increase of search functions within additional areas of Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) innovation is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   

Currently, the VA provides search functions within the medical notes and laboratory's sections of the CPRS for text and data.  Many of the other sections in CPRS contain a large amount of data and do not have search functions available for the VA health care providers.  This causes extensive research and manual retrieval of data by the health care providers which is inefficient.  Additional search options/capabilities added by this innovation will provide clinicians the ability to obtain health care information that was previously unavailable or missed.  VA will experience workflow improvements and efficiencies and health care provider's access to patient history will advance. 

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements
The VHA will identify CPRS content areas for a functional prototype to be developed allowing keyword or key term search options for CPRS similar to those found in Microsoft Office applications or Adobe programs.  Keyword search areas under consideration are:

Laboratory
Progress Notes
Adverse Reactions 
Discharge Summary. 
Inpatient and Outpatient Pharmacy 
Dietetics 
Laboratory 
Problem List 
Consult/Request Tracking. 
Patient Record Flags. 
Diagnosis

Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for a Robust VA Search Engine, Innovation # 242 VHA/OI&T II.  
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The development of a Robust VA Search Engine is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, there is a vast array of documents, forms, bulletins and memoranda VA employees need to access to complete their tasks.  This information exists on the web, but it exists in many places, on national, program, network and local sites, and locating them is a tedious, time-consuming, and manual process.
A robust VA search engine would improve the efficiency of locating documents and information needed on a daily basis throughout the VA.  This would result in achieving the following goals:
1.	Reduce the time it takes for VA staff to locate reference material to perform their duties.
2.	Greatly increase productivity of VA administrative staff by reducing the amount for time used to locate forms and other materials by 75 percent or more.
3.	 Empower infrequent users (e.g., physicians), giving them immediate access to reference material and VA or other health organization administrative documents.
4.	Impact the broadest number of VA staff:  All VA staff needs to locate documents and information in the performance of their day-to-day operations and responsibilities.
5.	Addresses an unmet need:  Information is vital to VA staff and the creation of a single tool that permits search capabilities for VA's and other organization information sources will demonstrate efficiency and increase staff knowledge and satisfaction.
6.	Help meet an organizational requirement:  The Joint Commission Accreditation Health Organization Standards and other VA Directives and Handbooks searches are difficult to locate within VA's existing intranet functionality.
Requirements  
The project will implement a dynamic search tool that VA staff may use to easily and quickly access VA and or Standard Forms, reference material, regulatory and other information they require to complete their daily tasks efficiently and effectively.  The tool will appear as a link on most if not all Veterans Health Administration web pages and will access a powerful search engine; providing, VA employees a gateway to web pages across the Veterans Health Administration.  Included would be the ability to search within a particular healthcare system (intranet), the larger Veterans Integrated Service Network, and nationally within the Veterans Health Administration.  Solutions developed at one VA Medical Center will be easily accessible, adopted, or modified by other VA medical centers.  This will also create an additional benefit which is maximizing on VA employee's ideas.
The prototype includes hardware and software technology for the web-indexing, programming, and configuration required to safely set up and operate a multi-intranet search engine.  A search engine link shall be created for a limited number of intranet web pages within a VA Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN) which is a cluster of medical centers and clinics the deliver health care benefits within a specific geographic region, or a combination of two or more Veterans Integrated Services Networks.  
Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	2. Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for the innovation of an Online Radiology Protocoling Tool Integrated within CPRS/VistA, #292 VHA/OI&T.

Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  The Online Radiology Protocoling Tool Integrated within Clinical Patient Record System/Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (CPRS/VistA) is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation. 

Currently,   VA Radiologists review all clinician orders for advanced diagnostic imaging (Computerized Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Nuclear Medicine tests) and assign specific protocol instructions directing how each examination must be performed so that the clinical questions are answered.  This is standard practice and typically paper based.

VA Radiologists frequently do not receive sufficient information on exam requisitions to optimize the quality and safety of their protocol decisions.  Efforts to augment the clinical detail provided by the ordering provider can be cumbersome and negatively impact Radiologist productivity and department efficiency.

a)	Paper - based processes are inefficient.
b)	Lost paperwork
c)	Duplication of paperwork (and effort)
d)	Potential for vague documentation of responsibility

The development of this tool will accomplish the following:
a)	Improve Efficiency
1.	Alignment of multiple complementing but currently uncoordinated information sources will save Radiologist time, boosting productivity.
2.	Electronic environment will eliminate loss and/or duplication of paper protocol requests and facilitate departmental oversight of this process. 
3.	Current support personnel manually enter data onto paper protocol request forms.  Electronic system would automate this task, releasing support personnel to assume other duties. 
b)	Improve Care Quality
Optimized Radiologist protocol decisions will benefit medical appropriateness, diagnostic effectiveness, and patient safety.
c)	Document Responsibility
Clear tracking of decision making responsibility as well as communication (if any) that influenced decisions. 

VA's VistA system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements
The VA intends to improve the system by leveraging VHA information systems to maximize Radiologist advanced imaging protocoling effectiveness while preserving productivity.  Protocol decisions will occur within a tailored electronic environment displaying and coordinating functionality of all information and resources needed to make rapid, informed protocol decisions and actions.

Provide to Radiologists on one screen to:

o	Exam clinician's order 
o	Access to all pertinent textual data (allergies, medications, provider notes, imaging reports, ionizing radiation exposure history, etc.).  Initially presented data will be filtered for relevance. 
o	Access previous imaging exams (the actual image data)
o	Protocol action command space (to enter protocol decision)
o	Messaging portal to CPRS View Alert or Microsoft Outlook to streamline and catalog non-urgent communication with referring VA healthcare providers, when necessary. 

The solution would include creating an information Dashboard to support the utilization of a protocol action recorder either within or integrated alongside CPRS.  The Dashboard will collect from diverse applications and present clinical information in an efficient manner.   The protocol action recorder will integrate with current workflow procedures and processes.  The solution will create a functional prototype environment with test data only. In the test environment, the solution will access other applications, including the VA Computerized Record System and VistA Radiology via HL7 messaging (Health Level 7 - Message Standard for the health care information industry).  Other VA applications will be evaluated during requirements gathering.  Possible candidates include VistA Imaging, Laboratory, Clinical Flow Sheet, and Clinical Observations. 

Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	2. Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.
2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

<DESC>Introduction

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Parking Outpatient Prescription (Rx) to Prevent Waste.  #263

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The Parking Outpatient Rx to Prevent Waste is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, the VA's Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) currently has limitations in the prescription ordering and dispensing functions.  These limitations impact health care providers' medication ordering practices for recurring medications when the Veteran (patient) is seen regardless if the Veteran's prescription is not due for a refill.  This creates unnecessary dispensing of expensive medications, confusion with the Veteran since they have multiple prescriptions of the same medication and they are charged a fee (co-pay) for medicine they did not request.

The innovation is to develop a method for prescription prescribers to be able to "park" a prescription placing it in a "hold until requested" status.   This added functionality would improve quality of care, customer satisfaction, medication safety, efficiency, and decrease costs. 

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements

It is VA's intent for the health care provider to place a Veteran's prescription order in the VistA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and then choose whether the medication should be filled immediately (current functionality) or wait for the Veteran to request the medication (parking).  

The VA Pharmacy Department will prepare the prescription order electronically within the VistA Pharmacy Management System but will not actually fill and dispense the medication until the Veteran requests it.  

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 with an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.

<DESC>Introduction

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract to improve medication instruction for Veterans. #284

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The Illustrated Medication Instruction for Veterans is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently in the VA, approximately 50% of medications are not taken as prescribed which contributes to poor disease control, adverse health outcomes, excess health care utilization, and excess costs.  The current VA medication instruction leaflets are complex and not understood by the average Veteran (patient).  VA patients with low health literacy, impaired cognition, impaired vision, or complex medication regimens are at greater risk of misunderstanding instructions.  In addition transition of care, such as hospital discharge is another vulnerable time when the risk of medication mismanagement is high.

Through integration of the provision of illustrated medication instructions with VistA systems such as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and the Pharmacy Management System the VA may see improved quality of care and safety, efficiency in medication counseling and the medication reconciliation process, and transform the way Veterans are educated about their medication usage.

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements

VA intends to contract for the prototype development that will develop a functional prototype of a patient-centered medication list for VA patients that clearly describes detailed instructions for daily medication use.  The list will use large print, plain language, illustrations, and a simple "grid" like graphical screen or page layout to indicate how each medication should be taken, as well as its purpose.   

This patient-centered medication list will automatically generate the illustrated medication schedules and abstract medication information using images of specific pill type filled by the local pharmacy from the VistA Pharmacy Management System.  The prototype will utilize natural language processing technology to translate medication information and will be incorporated into the existing work flow during hospital discharge, medical reconciliation, medication ordering and dispensing.   This functionality could also be available for the VA patients through the patient portal, My HealtheVet.

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for a prototype that will create touch screen functionality for VA nurses when triaging patients (#294 VHA/OI&TI). 

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.   VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.

The "Touch Screen Nursing Triage of Patients" is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, the VA has a high volume nationally of patients who are walk-ins to the VA's Emergency Room and Urgent Care Clinic for unscheduled appointments.  Nurses triage these patients quickly and safely in order to initiate their treatment in a timely manner. Triaging entails taking vital signs and obtaining a patient history.  Presently, nurses document these findings in the VA's Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) progress note screen using keystrokes and mouse clicks.  This process is cumbersome, time-consuming, and not conducive to quickly triaging a high volume of patients.

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements

VA intends to contract for a prototype to develop an application for a touch screen device that interfaces with CPRS and allows nurses to triage patients more efficiently in the Emergency Room Department and Urgent Care Clinics.   The prototype application will allow the nurses to automatically import the vital signs into the triage note, allow nurses to document the history using the touch screen, instead of using keystrokes and mouse clicks, and permit medical orders to be generated based on the history obtained.

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Front Line Veteran Eligibility Staffing: Live & Phone.  #223

Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The Front Line Veteran Eligibility is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   The quality of care that determines Veterans' VA health care eligibility should be commensurate with the quality of care Veterans receive once they are in the VA Health Care system.  An estimated one in seven eligible veterans vested on one VA Medical Center Health Unit reported having been denied eligibility for VA health care by VA personnel or processes in recent years.  Veteran's access to VA Health Care is impeded by front line VA staff's lack of eligibility determination tools and available eligibility resources, complexity of VA health care eligibility categories, factors and qualifiers, and staff's lack of accountability for interactions with the Veterans who inquire about eligibility.  It is also impeded by the Veterans own lack of awareness and understanding of eligibility criteria.

The Front Line Veteran Eligibility Staffing:  Live and Phone project will develop and make available tools that will enable the VA to improve eligibility efficiencies that will result in fewer eligible Veterans being denied access to care, eliminate eligibility errors, and make staff more accountable.  The tools will increase staff access to comprehensive eligibility criteria and information, and will provide more eligible Veterans access to VA health care through improved processes and better informed front line staff.


Requirements

Develop a web-based user-friendly software program using decision-tree methodology to encompass 12 separate question or statement windows, each with one or more sub layers that specify eligibility criteria and "as needed" explanatory information links.  Require user authentication to provide for staff accountability for interactions with Veterans about eligibility questions.    

Establish a database to capture the data entered through the application.  Provide a suite of reports to allow oversight of programs.  

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information by June 11, 2010 with an extended date of June 16, 2010.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	 Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Doctor Pager Number's innovation, #246, VHA/OI&T.

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.   VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The Doctor Pager Numbers Innovation is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.  It is difficult to find the correct clinician's pager number, or the correct on-call clinical specialist's phone number for an inpatient at a VA Medical Center.  Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) currently records the patient's Primary Healthcare Provider's and the Attending Physician's contact information.  It does not identify or record the On-Call Hospitalist, the Intern, the Resident, the On-Call Resident, or the Case Manager.

There are also many other on-call healthcare providers and specialists that are contacted while a patient is in the hospital.  These practitioners are not identified in patient's electronic record, VA's CPRS.  Ancillary services such as the Laboratory, Pharmacy, Radiology, Travel and Nursing staff have a frequent and urgent need for these contact numbers.   VA believes having this contact information readily available can significantly improve the VA's health care delivery system and increase interventions when medically necessary.

This innovation will also support VA's National Center for Patient Safety current goal for "Improving Communication among Caregivers."  It will also improve patient care by decreasing the time it takes to contact healthcare providers with critical laboratory results or patient updates, or to ask the healthcare provider for authorization or clarification concerning medical treatment for the patient.  Finally, it will reduce VA medical center's staff frustration and stress.  

This change will greatly improve the efficiency of the staff, reduce staff time spent on researching the correct contact information or prevent paging the wrong healthcare provider.  This change will positively impact every VA medical center inpatient, staff, and the VA's healthcare delivery system.

VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  

Requirements

VA intends to contract for a solution to the current "PRIMARY CARE" tab/drop-down list in the VA's CPRS which would be renamed "ASSIGNED PROVIDERS," and expanded to include up-to-date contact information for all healthcare providers assigned to the patient, and include the assigned clinic reference number the VA case manager.  If the patient is an active inpatient, it will display their Intern and Resident, as appropriate. 

The contact numbers on the "ASSIGNED PROVIDERS" drop-down tab in CPRS will automatically update CPRS whenever the VA Medical Center administration staff (Ward Clerk) enters a Healthcare Provider change in VistA which is typically found in a clinician's medical orders.  There would be new fields in VistA, in which to enter the patient's Resident and Case Manager Names.  VA has a database of healthcare providers contact information which would simply need to be extended.  A new and second tab in CPRS will display a drop-down healthcare provider contact list with up-to-date contact information for all of the "ON-CALL PROVIDERS" (clinicians, nurses and ancillary services) for the particular hospital location (Ward) that the patient is assigned to.  This contact information shall be blank unless the patient was an active inpatient.

The contact information available from the "ON-CALL PROVIDERS" drop-down tab in CPRS will automatically update by pulling from a new common database in VistA.  VA Medical Center supervisory staff will be responsible to keep the database updated.  The fields to be updated for each Service are: 

1.	Date from/Time from, Date to/Time to, 

2.	Provider's Name, Phone Number/Pager Number, and Assigned Wards/Locations. 

A new, third tab in CPRS will display a drop-down list of frequently-needed "OTHER PHONE NUMBERS" at the VA facility where the patient is assigned, or where he/she is admitted. 

The contact numbers on the "OTHER PHONE NUMBERS" drop-down tab in CPRS will also pull from a new database in VistA which is updated by a VA Medical Center, Medical Administrative Services Supervisor.  

Submittal Information

It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information with an initial cutoff date of June 11, 2010 and an extended date of June 16, 2010 for submissions.

1.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.

2.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

3.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.

4.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Responses are requested no later than close of business on June 11, 2010 with an extended date of June 16, 2010, via email to matthew.truex@va.gov and anne.vasconcelos@va.gov.

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for the development of a functional prototype to increase functionality in the VA's Computerized Patient Record system (CPRS) Surgical Package, Innovation # 251 VHA/OI&T II.    

Background

Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  

The Integration of the VA's Surgery Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) package into the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) package is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype.  Currently, the Surgical Package creates a challenge for clinicians and other healthcare providers.    The current system consists of the Surgical Package, which includes VistA-based program (M-Technology) plus CPRS Elements (Graphical User Interface).  The CPRS elements include Perioperative Care Plan Components (Pre/Intra/Post/Time Out/Specimen).  The VistA elements include four discrete data entry sections, Operations, Operation Start Up, Surgical Staff, and Post Operative.  The CPRS Package also has a Blood Verification/Scanning, Radiology Consult Entry and Wristband Print capability.  The disadvantages of the VistA Surgery package that have been identified as challenging are:  Non-GUI format, Key Stroke/Free Text Data Entry, Roll and Scroll format, No capability for Prosthetic/Implant Consults data entry, and it is difficult to train new staff.  The process is cumbersome switching back and forth from CPRS to VistA for documentation and unreliable data transfer to CPRS for consultations.  The function "copy and paste" is used to transfer data into implant consultations.  


Requirements

VA intends to contract for a prototype to integrate the VistA Surgery Package into CPRS.  Nursing personnel will log into one program for all their documentation which will provide a simplification of data entry and eliminate unnecessary time.  Other prototype goals are:

"	Accurate prosthetic and or implant consultations

"	Better data tracking

"	Expedite replacement of implants

"	Reduce lost revenue for unaccounted implants

"	Decrease turnover time of replacement implants

VA believes the full integration of the Surgery Package into CPRS and the creation of the ability to enter the 4 basic elements of the Surgery Package (Operations/Operations Start Up/Surgical Staff/Post-Operative) via templates in CPRS would allow for the elimination of duplicate documentation.  VA would like to focus on redundant documentation, particularly implant/consult documentation.

<DESC>Description: The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Telemetry Systems Integration &amp; Support (TSIS) Program, Edwards AFB CA, intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Commercial contract for the refurbishment, upgrade, and enhancement of existing antenna systems on Edwards AFB and China Lake to Telemetry &amp; Communications Systems, Inc. This acquisition is restricted. <br /><br />The Telemetry Systems Integration &amp; Support (TSIS) program is an Improvement &amp; Modernization (I&amp;M) program initiated as a mid-life upgrade for the existing ground-based telemetry system used by 412 RANS. TSIS will upgrade all 412 RANS owned ground-based telemetry systems, which includes upgrading ten ground-based fixed telemetry sites, four trailer-mounted ground-based antennas, four ground-based mobile telemetry vans, and several additional antenna upgrades. In addition to 412 RANS owned ground-based telemetry systems, the TSIS scope includes the addition of C-band serial streaming telemetry (SST) receiving systems, SST transmitters on board AFFTC aircraft, and the modification of ground-based antennas belonging to the Test Pilot School. In addition to providing a mid-life upgrade to the AFFTC telemetry system, TSIS will enhance frequency spectrum usage by developing an AFFTC capability to operate serial streaming telemetry in C-band (4400-4940 MHz) as well as equipping the telemetry system with an iNET enabling capability. The iNET enabling capability will be limited to providing a communication channel in the telemetry antenna feed system and rotary joint to allow iNET command and control signals to pass.
<p>Requirement: The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract is $6.6M. The period of performance is expected to be five years after contract award. The requirement of the TSIS effort can be summarized as:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide midlife upgrade to existing telemetry systems.<br />&bull; Augment existing Edwards telemetry ground and airborne systems capabilities to operate in C-band (4400-4940 MHz, 5091-5150 MHz), as well as the previous capability for L-Band (1435-1525 MHz, 1755-1850 MHz), S-Band (2200-2290 MHz), and Upper-S-Band (2360-2395 MHz). <br />&bull; Provide iNET enabled communication channels, including command and control uplink capability.</p>
<p>Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. Anticipated award date is early October 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 2:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, 15 days from NOCA issuance. Responses should be submitted via: e-mail vanessa.shannon@edwards.af.mil or by fax, fax #: 661-277-0470 (please call and verify that I have received the fax).</p>

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Severstal Dearborn, Inc. for Pension Administration Services.
<p>During Fiscal year 2010, PBGC assumed trusteeship of the Rouge Steel Salaried Plans. Severstal is the plan administrator for the Rouge Steel Salaried pension plans, who administers the benefits of approximately 1353 participants. Severstal will continue to maintain and transfer information and data related to the plan benefits, plan provisions, and participant data for 12 months</p>
<p>The continued management of these benefits by Severstal is prudent until the benefit payments, documentation and historic knowledge of the Plans can be transitioned to the PBGC because of the size, complexity, inhered knowledge, and past practices of the Plans precludes its transition without interrupting benefit payments to participants, and increasing congressional oversight.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but a Notice of Intent. No RFP will be issued. Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later than 09:00 AM Eastern Time, June 11, 2010) by email to the Contracting Officer, Patrick McFarlane at mcfarlane.patrick@pbgc.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-161-6215<br />Name: Ruler, Wood, 12"<br />Description: 12" wood ruler, single brass edge, beveled, 1/16" gradations</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0894<br />Name: Yardstick, Wood<br />Description: Yardstick, wood, flush design, metal ends with hang up hole at end. Clear lacquer<br />finish, inches with 1/8" gradations</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be GSA/Federal Supply Service Office Support Center - Paper Products.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-161-6215<br />Similar Items: ACM 05221, ACM 05011, ACM 10375, UNV 59021, ACM 10702, LEO 77120</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0894<br />Similar Items: ACM 10425</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 22, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

     0  (b)  10 USC 2304(c)(2) or 41 USC 253(c)(2); FAR 6.302-2:  Unusual and 	compelling urgency.  When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of 	such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be 	seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources 	from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be 	provided for.  This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers 	from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.
     0  (a)  Services can only be provided from the original source as this is a follow-on 	requirement for the continued provision of highly specialized services. FAR 	6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii).
     0  (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to 	the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. FAR 	6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A).
     1  (c)  Services/Supplies are needed immediately to satisfy mission requirements and unacceptable delays will result when an award is made to any other source. FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (B).

Additional Information:	(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not 	provided on time?

<DESC>RE: VA Northampton Boiler Building Project Questions, Set #2

1. 	DWG M1001 and Section 23 09 11. Section 23 09 11 does not list a plant
master panel or balance of plant panel. That section describes a plant master
control loop. Is a plant master panel and balance of plant panel specified? If
so the control loops would logically be boiler plant master (Surge tank and DA
tank level and pump control, see Drawing MP-201) with the meters and
transmitters listed on Drawing MP-201. Please clarify. Response 1 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

2. 	Section 23 09 11, page 1, 1.3.B, Quality Assurance. Do the control

3. 	Section 23 09 11, page 4, 2.1.A.2: Plant master, parallel positioning with O2
trim, draft, 2 element feed water control loops are specified. Are these the
control loops? Response 3 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

4. 	Section 23 09 11, page 6, 2.1.B.18: This controller listed in this section is only
burner management technology and not combustion control system. Examples
of combustion control systems meeting the specification are Hays Cleveland
AC Stations and Preferred PCC III. Can these controllers be the "or
equivalent"? Response 4 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.

5. 	Section 23 09 11, page 5, 2.1.B describes multiple loop controllers while page
6, 2.1.D describes touch screen technologies. Which technology should be
provided for the combustion control loops? The latest technologies for recent
VA projects are touch screen types. Response 5 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
6.	Section 23 09 11, page 9, 2.1 .F specifies VFD control for the FD damper. Shall VFD control and new VFD's be included for each boiler? Response 6 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
7.	Section 23 09 11, page 10, 2.I.2 specifies software and hardware sufficient for the project. Typically that includes a laptop computer with software. Is that what is intended? Response 7 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
8.	Section 23 09 11, pages 10 to 14, 2.1.J.1 to 2.1.J.5 describes the plant master control loop and other loops for each boiler. Please confirm these loops are required. Response 8 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
9.	Section 23 09 11, page 14, 2.1.J.6. and DWG M1001 shows two element feed water control. Shall this control loop be supplied with the combustion control system? Are boiler feed water flow meters required? Response 9 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
10.	Section 23 09 11, page 15, 2.1 .J.7 requires economizer efficiency and boiler combustion efficiency computations. Are economizers being supplied for each boiler? If so temperature sensors will need to be supplied for this computation. Response 10 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
11.	Section 23 09 11 page 24, 2.3 and DWG M1001: Section 2.3 lists boiler panels
and burner management panels for each boiler. One of the control loops listed in the specification is a plant master loop. This loop and controllers are typically installed on a plant master panel. Shall as plant master panel be supplied. What other panels are required? Response 11 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
12.	Section 23 09 11, page 25, 2.4.A.B. Is Windows 7 acceptable? Response 12 - Please make your proposal based on the contract documents.
13.	Section 23 09 11, page 37, 2.4.C.18 to page 41, 2.4.D. This section should be
edited to delete any transmitter, meter, sensor and computation that are not required with this project.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Water, Office of Ground Water Drinking Water, Water Security Division (OW/OGWDW/WSD) requires a four (4) month extension on the existing active Contract EP-C-05-045 which will result in an additional 40,000 hours level of effort. The contract had originally been scheduled to expire as of July 31, 2010, but with the 4-month extension it will now expire as of November 30, 2010. Extenuating circumstances involving a GAO protest prior to award has impacted a timely award of the follow-on contract, necessitating this extension.<br /><br />The contract provides technical support services of a unique nature for the WSD mission needs, and also provides critical support services to other Offices of the EPA [Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Emergency Management (OEM) effort; National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) efforts, including Methods Development and Security Products Assessment and Review efforts]. Without having the 4-month extension for the contract expiration date, very high priority, high visibility requirements would be severely impacted, jeopardizing the progress toward carrying out homeland security directives. The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Contract EP-C-05-045 is posted as an Attachment for your information.<br /><br />The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, an increase to the level of effort for this contract. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and FAR 6.302.1 which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source. The basis for this determination is that only Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), the incumbent, can provide the continuity to complete the remaining complex technical work. The requirements are in sensitive stages of development, and abandoning the efforts at this point for lack of contractual coverage would not be a reasonable option. Likewise, the time required to solicit a new contractor and allow that contractor to get up to speed on the requirements in the middle of a project would not be cost effective or efficient. In addition, the contract includes specific capabilities for secret and/or sensitive work, which is not common on other Agency contracts already in place. Furthermore, the analysis type effort for various highly sensitive contaminants is also unique on this contract, and is able to support the type of method development that NHSRC is working toward.<br /><br />Sources wishing to be considered must submit documentation to the office identified above which establishes that (1) the company has the expertise to meet the contract technical requirements contained in the PWS identified above; (2) it has a Top Secret facility and safeguarding clearance; (3) it has the facilities, equipment, and personnel available; and (4) a mobilization plan demonstrating an ability to immediately step in and assume the duties under this contract without any delays, disruptions, or impact on the quality of the work effort.&nbsp; <strong>Documentation should be submitted by June 24, 2010.</strong> All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation including the above information which shall be considered by the agency. See notes 22 and 26.</p>

(DUNS 021623579).  This project consists of replacing roller chains at the Knightville Dam in Huntington, MA. The fabricated steel gates are approximately 70 years old and are operated by stationary wire rope hoists. Gate movement is facilitated by roller chains, which are mounted on the sides of the gates and covered by chain guards. One of these chains has fallen off gate 3, and two new chains are required for that gate. Rebuild the 5 remaining chains using existing rollers and links, and providing new pins designed to accommodate retaining ring fasteners. (Existing pins are riveted.) Note that only one gate may be worked on at a time; the other two gates must remain operational. The extra chain will be stored on site as spare.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number RFQ-006-43YK-10 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-40. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516. This procurement is unrestricted.
<p>USDA ARS has a requirement for an instrument to measure the flow properties or rheology of a liquid dispersion, suspension, or other semi-solid material. These measurements are important for degradation studies and the development of stable feed additives and formulations. The appropriate instrument should be a controlled stress instrument with the following capabilities:</p>
<p>General Specifications</p>
<p>Combined motor and transducer rheometer should incorporate a magnetic levitation thrust bearing, as compared to traditional air or mechanical bearings, to minimize residual friction for accurate torques controlled down to 0.003 microN*m.</p>
<p>The torque motor must be a non-contact drag-cup induction design with a non-contact induction temperature sensor. The sensor provides a direct measure of the temperature of the drag cup and insures absolute torque control unaffected by temperature change in the drag cup.</p>
<p>The rheometer must include both automatic temperature system and geometry recognition to minimize operator time and eliminate potential mistakes with configurations and test set-up. This would allow a user to quickly change between temperature devices, automatically recognize the system in use, and configure and set all relevant calibrations in the control software. All information specific to the geometry should be automatically configured into the software with appropriate parameters (type, dimension, material).</p>
<p>The maximum torque to inertia ratio of no less than 11,000 with the ratio defined by torque in microN*m divided by inertia in microN*m*s2. <br /><br />The inertia of the instrument drive motor must be specified and no bigger than 19microN*m*s2.</p>
<p>The response time of instrument in step strain must be specified and no longer than 30ms.</p>
<p>The response time of instrument in step velocity must be specified and no longer than 7ms.</p>
<p>The rheometer must be capable of running direct strain mode during oscillation.</p>
<p>The rheometer must be capable of demonstrating the ability to measure viscosity of less than 1 mPa*s at a maximum motor speed of 0.05 rad/s using geometry no larger than a 40 mm cone or parallel plate.</p>
<p>The rheometer must be able to characterize the entire spectrum of viscoelastic materials from extremely low viscosity fluids (less than 1 mPa*s) by changing the various configurations from concentric cylinder, to parallel plate, to cone and plate, to torsional clamping systems for solids.<br />All torque specifications must be in terms of instrument torque (torque applied by the motor), not sample torque. <br /><br />The instrument software must report both torque applied by the motor and torque actually applied to the sample.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have a torque range in both controlled stress and rate steady shear modes of 0.01 microNm to 200 milliNm.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have a torque resolution of no more than 0.1 nanoN.m at a torque of 0.1 microN.m.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have a torque range in both controlled stress and controlled strain oscillation mode (as opposed to just controlled strain mode) of 0.003 microNm to 200 milliNm.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have an angular velocity range in controlled stress mode of 0 to 300 rad/s.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have an angular velocity range in controlled rate mode of 1.4x10-9 to 300 rad/s.</p>
<p>The rheometer must have a frequency range of in oscillation mode of 1.2E-7 to 100 Hz (7.5E-7 to 628 rad/s).</p>
<p>The displacement resolution of the rheometer should be no more than 25 nrad.</p>
<p>The rheometer must be capable of operating in the following modes: <br />1) Oscillation Mode Tests: <br />i. Torque/Stress sweep (linear or log) at single frequency <br />ii. Frequency sweep (linear or log) at single torque<br />iii. Frequency sweep (linear or log) at single strain<br />iv. Strain/angular displacement sweep (linear or log) at single frequency<br />v. Temperature sweep at single frequency/torque<br />vi. Superimposed stress oscillation and steady shear<br />vii. Superimposed strain oscillation and steady shear<br />viii. Multiple simultaneous frequencies superimposed on above modes<br />2) Flow Mode Tests:<br />i. Controlled stress or torque sweeps.<br />ii. Controlled rate (1/s) or speed (rad/s) sweeps.<br />iii. Stress stepped flow.<br />iv. Equilibrium stress stepped flow (so material has time to respond to each level of stress).<br />v. Temperature sweeps at constant stress or rate.<br />vi. Squeeze flow and pull off.<br />3) Creep Mode Tests:<br />i. Constant stress creep and recovery.<br />ii. Automatic sensing of steady state during creep test.<br />4) Stress relaxation<br />5)The rheometer must be capable of running any of the available tests described above in one mixed procedure. In addition, while running the procedure, succeeding steps can be adapted or new steps added.</p>
<p>The rheometer must correct for residual bearing friction.</p>
<p>The rheometer must allow for motor and geometry inertia correction in both flow and oscillation mode, with the actual inertia measured by the instrument</p>
<p>The rheometer must automatically zero the gap.</p>
<p>The rheometer must provide for genuine normal force measurement from 0.005 to 50 N using a high sensitivity load cell.</p>
<p>The rheometer must allow for the gap to be closed in the following ways: Standard, user defined velocity; user defined exponential decay, and normal force. The speed of gap closure is continuously variable.</p>
<p>During temperature sweeps or ramps, the gap must automatically adjust for thermal expansion/contraction of the measurement plates by actual movement of the geometry.</p>
<p>During any test the normal force on the sample [compression or tension] can be kept within defined limits. In addition during temperature sweeps or ramps the gap must automatically adjust for thermal expansion/contraction of the measurement plates by actual movement of the geometry as long as the NF control limits are not violated. Software gap correction for parallel plates should be invoked if the limits have been reached.</p>
<p>The rheometer system must display the oscillation waveforms real-time and store the waveform for each data point onto disk. The waveform should be viewable in either a graphical or tabular form in the analysis package in order to provide an indication of the amount of noise, slip, or inertial correction for each point.</p>
<p>The instrument software must report raw phase (sample + instrument) in oscillation experiments so the amount of instrument inertia correction applied during the measurement can be quantified. The instrument must not "clamp" the phase angle to assumed theoretical values of between 0 and 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Rheometer must include a local keypad on the front of the rheometer that allows for the rheometer measuring head to be raised and lowered and for the gap to be zeroed as well as for the measurement to be started/stopped.</p>
<p>Rheometer must include an electronic bearing lock that is automatically released at the start of an experiment, not a hardware lock that must be manually removed before a test is started.</p>
<p>Main rheometer electronics and power supply must be housed in a separate unit to minimize the effects of vibration and heat.</p>
<p>Rheometer should have two radial bearings for axial rigidity.</p>
<p>Measuring System Specifications</p>
<p>Standard parallel plate and cone and plate measuring systems used with the Peltier plate must come in a variety of materials including aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium.</p>
<p>The torsional clamping fixtures must support rectangular shapes with a length up to 50 mm, thickness to 5 mm.</p>
<p>Concentric cylinder measuring systems available must include DIN, recessed, vaned, Grooved and double gap.</p>
<p>Du Nouy ring option must be available for interfacial rheology.</p>
<p>Software Specifications</p>
<p>Control and data analysis software must conform to industry standard Microsoft Windows operating system.<br /><br />The software must offer ability to automatically update both instrument software and firmware through the Internet using an update routine. The software must be able to automatically look for updates and inform user when available.</p>
<p>The software must include image capture and streaming video capability that can be interfaced with a camera through computer USB connection.</p>
<p>Ability to run rheometer and perform other tasks simultaneously such as data analysis, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Excel. Software must operate on same controller as thermal analysis modules.<br /><br />Ability to cut data graphs and tables to Clipboard and paste directly into third party Windows software such as Excel or Word.<br />The data analysis package must have the ability to run on any computer without the use of a hardware key. <br />System must include software that allows for development of custom "scripts" to automate running a specific experiment or series of experiments, and data analysis.</p>
<p>Ability to use the following models to predict material behavior:<br />a. Flow: Newtonian, Casson, Bingham, Herschel-Buckley, Power Law, Sisko, Cross, Williamson, Ellis, Carreau, Best fit Polynomial.<br />b. Creep: discrete retardation spectrum, Polynomial.<br />c. Oscillation: Discrete and continuous relaxation spectrum, Spriggs, Oldroyd, Polynomial, Time Temperature Superposition with WLF and Arrhenius models, and Coz-Merz<br />d. Stress relaxation: Discrete and continuous relaxation spectrum<br />e. User defined model</p>
<p>Software must have capability to calculate Mw using the equation Mw = K&#61544;o x where K and x are provided in a polymer library.</p>
<p>Software must be upgradeable to include transformation software to provide interconversion of master curves.</p>
<p>Time/Temp Superposition capability must be built into the software package and not a third party program.</p>
<p>All raw data or instrument parameters must be accessible.</p>

<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST AN FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><br />BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD:<br />(a) NAICS: 924110<br />(b) NR OF EMPLOYEES: <br />(c) Contract Type: FFP</p>
<p>Requirement: <br />To conduct physical, chemical, and or biological laboratory analyses of drinking water, and provide the results of each analysis to the State Regulatory Agency to comply with the requirements of the National Drinking Water Regulations and related State Regulations for Safe Drinking Water. The Period of Performance for this contract will be 1-Year with four options years available at the discretion of the 78th Medical Group, Robins AFB, GA.</p>
<p>* See attaced statement of work for specific requirementson testing and reporting.</p>
<p>This solicitation is identified as Sole Source Solicitation for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) Laboratory. The Georgia EPD laboratory is the State regulatory agency for State water testing and EPA Compliance Reporting. The GA EPD laboratory also employs the State Geologist who administers chemical monitoring waivers when required. Marketing Research has not identified any sources capable of meeting the State's requirement for testing and reporting. As such, Robins AFB requires continuity in this current service to eliminate the possibility of a Notice of Violation being issued against the base for late State reporting of water sample findings. Until such a time that a commercial laboratory can provide all the services that the EPD laboratory does, it is not in the best interest of the government to pursue such avenues. In an effort to remove or overcome such a barrier to competition in the future, the market will be searched periodically for companies that could meet all ofthe government's requirements. Where possible, the government will make future requirements suitable for fuIl and open competition.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<DESC>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous to the Government.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  The offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.   The Brand Name for the below items is Carl Zeiss. 

Evaluation Factors for Award: Low price, technically acceptable (meets the brand name only requirement).  Offerors shall price each CLIN.  This is an all or nothing requirement, therefore, vendor shall provide a price for each CLIN, otherwise your proposal will be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration (this includes manuals). Brand name only. No substitutions will be allowed. Brand name only is specified to ensure that sites receive standardized supplies and equipment.

v. Description of requirements for the items to be acquired. 

C.1 BACKGROUND
The Library of Congress has constructed a state-of-the-art off-site storage facility for collections at Ft. Meade, MD. The facility houses books, pamphlets and bound periodicals, as well as special format collections, including maps, prints, photographs, sheet music, manuscripts, microfilm and other formats. Collections stored at this facility are housed inside Ft. Meade containers for protection against light, dust and other factors that can damage the items.

Many of these collections are in very fragile and brittle condition and require additional protection prior to housing the items inside a Ft. Meade container, basically creating a container within a container. Some collections are already housed in poor quality/acidic containers, folders, sleeves or boxes, and prior to placing these in Ft. Meade containers and relocating them to Ft. Meade, these enclosures must be replaced with acid-free ones that are permanent and durable and help preserve the items. For some of the special format collections, customized acid-free containers are needed to best preserve the collections inside the Ft. Meade container according to its shape.

Preservation of these artifacts through proper housing is an urgent matter and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

C.2  SCOPE
This request is for a contractor to perform two projects:  1) to provide condition evaluation and rehousing for approximately 200,000 books and pamphlets; and 2) to place approximately 35,000 oversize books (folios) and bound serial volumes from the Librarys collections, many of which are in fragile and brittle condition into Ft. Meade containers.  Note: The skill and knowledge level for employees performing Project 1 is considered by the Government to be at a higher level than that for Project 2.  In preparing its proposal, the contractor will be expected to propose staff with the appropriate skill levels for each of these two projects.

Project 1: Rehousing and Preparing Finding-aids for Books and Pamphlets
The contractor will assemble boxes and place each volume in the best fitting box, from among pre-determined sizes. Contractor will sort volumes by condition, remove acidic enclosures and metal fasteners, house items inside acid-free envelopes, slings, folders and boxes, prepare envelopes and slings sets, prepare inventory of containers contents, search records in Library of Congress (LC) databases, label containers, duplicate labels on containers, check LC database for bibliographic information of books prepare finding-aid lists, cut supplies (such as foam, boards, paper) to fit inside boxes, and prepare additional supplies (such as polyester enclosures with double-sided tape) to house collections. Tasks also include compiling statistical data and providing written weekly reports of activity with photo documentation before, during and after completion of each phase.

It is imperative that this project be conducted by experienced professionals with experience both in handling fragile objects on a timely manner due to the condition and quantity of these volumes. Work will be carried out on-site in a secure location and contractors have to ensure that the necessary quality and quantity of work is performed. The project shall require careful handling and ability to evaluate the condition of individual items, and knowledge of preservation/preventive conservation and archival practices. It also requires knowledge in and proficiency in the use of Microsoft Office 2007, especially Word, Excel and Photoshop. Contractors will be directly supervised by CALMs Collections Officer.

Project 2:  Containerizing Folio Volumes
The contractor will assemble Ft. Meade containers and place each volume in the best fitting container, selecting from among pre-determined sizes.  In order to ensure that the item(s) in the container are as stationary as possible, contractor will use filler, supplied by the Library, to eliminate the gap between the item and the sides of the container.  The anticipated number of items to be completed under this contract is 35,000.  The collections to be containerized are located both on Capitol Hill and at the Librarys off-site storage facility, the Landover Center Annex, located approximately ten miles east of Capitol Hill in Landover, MD.

Source selection will be based on the best overall value to the Government.   I. TECHNICAL FACTORS All technical factors are of approximately equal importance.  1.

REQUIREMENTS: See Performance Work Statement (PWS), and Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Submit pricing in accordance with the directions of Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<BR>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<BR>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<BR>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<BR>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<BR>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<BR>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<BR>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<BR>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<BR>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<BR>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<BR>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<BR>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<BR>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<BR>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<BR>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<BR>determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<BR>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<BR>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<BR>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR>Quotes are due back to Matthew.Richard@us.af.mil  by Thursday 17 June 2010 at 12:00 PM PST.<BR>

BRAND NAME POSTING:FNMOC has an installed base of DDN equipment spanning multiple HPC clusters.  Maintenance on these systems is being procured from the manufacturer (Data Direct Networks) or an authorized reseller. This Justification is two-fold: (1) The equipment we have is that which must be covered (Brand Name): warranty support on similar, but not identical, equipment is not acceptable. 
(2) FNMOC is working to align all of its maintenance from the same company and with identical periods of performance for ease of management, tracking, oversight, and procurement.  This procurement is to align the maintenance of the S2A9900 on OPAL, Emerald and Ruby and the S2A9950 on Ruby. Having a single vendor providing storage and maintenance on all systems is a good management practice, reduces errors, and simplifies oversight; making it easier for FNMOC to meet its mission of 98.5% up-time and availability around-the-clock, 365 days a year.

The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.<BR><BR><BR>GOOD	The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no deficiencies and any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.<BR><BR>SATISFACTORY<BR>	The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of successfully meeting the requirements.<BR><BR>MARGINAL	The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <BR><BR>UNSATISFACTORY	The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions, weaknesses or deficiencies, and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>PRICE. (Factor 3) is not rated. Price and cost analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offerors proposed price. Price will be evaluated for realism, valued offered for the price, and extent, which it is fair and reasonable  in terms of the Government requirement. Only those quotes considered technical and past performance acceptable will be further evaluated for price. (End of 52.212-2 Addendum). <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>        <BR><BR> <BR>       <BR><BR>             <BR>     <BR><BR>    <BR>

<p>Additional costs for shipment to addresses other than those specified on the order will not be paid unless the ship to/delivery address has been changed by a modification to the order signed by a contracting officer.<br />INVOICING PROCEDURES:</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC INVOICING: Except as provided in paragraph (c) of DFARS Clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (Mar 2007), the Contractor shall submit payment requests through Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) utilizing the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) method. The COMBO method is designed to generate a notification to the receiver that an invoice has been submitted and requires a receiving report. Utilization of this feature is expected to minimize delays in the payment process.</p>
<p>Contractors shall register to use WAWF and ensure an electronic business point of contact (POC) is designated in the Central Contractor Registration site at http://www.ccr.gov within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract/order.</p>
<p>Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at the following addresses:</p>
<p>WAWF General Information and Registration - https://wawf.eb.mil <br />WAWF Training Database (great place to practice using WAWF) - https://wawftraining.eb.mil <br />WAWF On-line Training Course (great place to begin learning WAWF) - www.wawftraining.com <br />DFAS Electronic Commerce End Users Tool Box (register for classroom training and obtain user guides) <br />http://www.dfas.mil/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/ECToolBox.html</p>
<p>ALTERNATE METHOD: In the event WAWF is not available, invoices may also be submitted via fax to: <br />DFAS - Rome, FAX# 877-575-3332. This method is to be used by exception only.</p>
<p>TO ACCESS PAYMENT STATUS ELECTRONICALLY:<br />https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil//index.html</p>
<p>FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE VENDOR PAY INQUIRY SYSTEM:<br />http://www.dod.mil/dfas/contractorpay/vedorpayinquiresystemvpis.html</p>
<p>CUSTOMER SERVICE inquiries may be made to: 1-800-553-0527</p>
<p>DFAS: Questions concerning payments should be directed to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Office as designated in this contract. Please have your purchase order/contract number ready when calling about payments. You can also access payment and receipt information using the DFAS web site at http://www.dfas.mil/money/vendor. Your purchase order/contract number or invoice number will be required to inquire about the status of your payment.</p>
<p>Unique Identification</p>
<p>IUID of items is accomplished by marking each qualifying item with a permanent 2-dimensional data matrix. The data matrix is encoded with the data elements necessary to construct a Unique Item Identifier (UII) which is globally unique and unambiguous. The data elements required to form a UII include the manufacturer's identification (i.e. cage code) and the item's serial number. If the manufacturer serializes within part number, that data element will also be encoded.</p>
<p>Because the data matrix is machine-readable, IUID marking greatly reduces human error and improves the accuracy of inventory and acquisition records.</p>
<p>UIIs are stored in comprehensive IUID Registry, which allows easy access to information such as acquisition cost and life-cycle data. The IUID Registry is maintained by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS). Every IUID delivery includes the required data elements describing the end item and the "pedigree" of embedded items. This data is captured during the acceptance process via the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) application, or after acceptance via direct data submission. Items marked with IUIDs accelerate the receipt and acceptance process, allowing DoD to submit payment to its vendors in a timely fashion, thereby saving on late charges.</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br /><br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br /><br />The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the salient characteristics of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the salient characteristics is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).<br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 29 June 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 30 June 2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200138 in subject line.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>FAR 52.246-1 Contractor Inspection Requirements (Apr 1984)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for performing or having performed all inspections and tests necessary to substantiate that the supplies or services furnished under this contract conform to contract requirements, including any applicable technical requirements for specified manufacturers' parts. This clause takes precedence over any Government inspection and testing required in the contract's specifications, except for specialized inspections or tests specified to be performed solely by the Government.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p><br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI program in Kyrgyzstan will support the objectives of the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Country Office in Kyrgyzstan (USAID/ Kyrgyzstan), and the USAID Regional Mission to the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) of (1) economic growth, (2) investing in people through health care and education, and (3) governing democratically and justly by strengthening parliament and local governance as well as civil society and media. The goals of the OTI program in Kyrgyzstan are to promote stability, decrease the chances of unrest, and facilitate efforts to restore core government functions.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an OTI Deputy Country Representative that will support USAID/OTI's program in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

ATTACHMENT 1 ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10 PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY (OCTOBER 2006) (a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 . Note: Personal Services Contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs. (b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES." (c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision). (d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met: (1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad; (2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and (3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition. (e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs. (f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism. (g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider. (h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent. (i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s). </span></p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 3
CHANGES
All requirements for developing new abstracts when they do not exist have been removed from this statement of work and solicitation.  If an abstract does not exist the individual landowners will need to contract directly with a service provider to have an abstract developed.  The requirement to update existing abstracts remains within the scope of this solicitation and any resultant contract.  See the attached Statement of Work, Revision 3, which reflects these changes.  Additionally, this amendment removes line items 002, 009, and 016 Developing New Abstract from bid schedule listed in this notice.



RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS
Q.  With regards to the past performance and references do you only want contact information from specific files or is it ok to obtain letters of recommendations from lenders we do a large volume of business for and our title insurance underwriters?
A.  The past performance references can be from the specific files referenced in the prior experience factor or can be from other firms.  However, the past performance references should be from customers of yours that you have provided similar services to as you would be doing under any resultant contract from this solicitation.


Q. Am I correct in thinking that these past files can be from files that involved any type of an easement (i.e. driveway easement, wetland easement, conservation, utility easements)?
A.  Yes.  Any type of easement would be acceptable.


Q.  With regards to the wage determination you indicated that we should use the Administrative Assistant category.  If we have an employee who will be spending some of their time on this contract and their wage does not reflect this amount, can we have them keep track of the time spent on these transactions and compensate them by paying them the additional amount only for these hours? 
A.  Correct.  They only need to be compensated at the rates in the wage determination for time spent on work under any potential contract.  Also, please note that I issued an amendment to the notice on the www.fbo.gov website.  A portion of it deals with this issue and is as follows.

Service Contract Act Wage Determinations
Due to the fact that specific occupational code titles are not listed for real estate transaction professionals, the Administrative Support and Clerical Occupations codes such as 01020, 01051, 01052, 01111, 01112, or 01113 as the offeror deems appropriate. If an offeror does not believe that any of these titles are appropriate, they should request a conformance action as detailed on the last page of each wage determination. This includes providing proposed occupational title(s) and proposed rate(s) with their offer.


Q.  I noticed on the bottom of the wage determination that all occupations must receive the following benefits.  Health and Welfare $3.35 per hour.  I'm assuming that this is above and beyond the wage amount?  Is this also something that we can compensate additionally only for the time spent on this contract?  
A.  Yes.  This is above and beyond the wage determination rate and is only for those hours spent on work under any potential contract.  It can be paid in cash or in the form of health and welfare benefits.


Q.  How can the health and welfare benefit requirement be paid?   
A.    See the following link from the US Dept of Labor regarding discharging an obligation to pay fringe benefits.  
http://www.dol.gov/dol/allcfr/title_29/part_4/29CFR4.175.htm
See section V for additional information.
http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/web/SCA_FAQ.htm


Q.  What about a subcontractor that we hire?  If we order abstract services from another vendor do we have to make sure that they are paying their employees this amount?  Are we required to obtain Errors and Omissions information from them?  
A.  Service Contract Act requirements to apply to both contractors and subcontractors.  See the following link.  Recordkeeping requirements are also mentioned on the website.  Unlike the Davis-Bacon Act which applies to labor practices in construction contracts, agencies that award contracts under the Service Contract Act do not routinely require submission of payroll records.  However, the DOL may as part of any audits they chose to conduct.  In construction contracts offices such as ours are required to obtain and review payroll records routinely.
http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-sca.htm


Q.  Are we permitted to utilize 40 year searches instead of creating new abstracts for these transactions?
A.  Most landowners we contract with have abstracts and we have them updated by vendors if needed.  If an abstract is not present at all, which is rare, the landowner must contract directly with a service provider to have new one developed.   Regarding the time frame for records search all pertinent records should be searched when updating an abstract.  Applicable standards are listed in the notice and are found at http://www.justice.gov/enrd/2001_Title_Standards.html.  Paragraph 5b states: In general, certificates of title and title insurance policies based upon a search of all records affecting the title and unqualified as to the period of search are preferred and should be issued."  While paragraph 3b mentions a minimum number of years, it is recommended that the standard at 5b be applied and that "all records affecting the title and unqualified as to the period of search."  This could exceed the timeframes listed in 3b and serves to help protect all interested parties.


Q.  What additional documents will be required to be signed at closing?
A.  Typical documents required at closing are the WRP Deed (NRCS) and the RIM Easement (State of Minnesota) which we provide and any documents required to cure all encumbrances specified by the NRCS.  These are the same documents that will typically need to be recorded.





AMENDMENT 2
CHANGES
The Statement of Work is revised to specify the location where closings will take place (see page 3 of 5, bottom).
Closings will be held at the local NRCS Field Office closest to the location of the easement property which is generally located in each county.  Any exceptions to the location will be identified by the easement specialist.

Revise Proposed Contract Base Performance Period
Text is changed to beginning approximately July 1, 2010, or the date of contract award, whichever is latest, through June 30, 2011 (changed from September 30, 2010).  The two option periods of one year each remain unchanged.  This change also requires that clause 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, be changed.  The time period is paragraph (c) is changed to 6 months and 3 years.  The date at clause 52.216-18, Ordering, must also change from 9/30/2010 to 6/30/11.  Clause 452.211-75, Effective Period of Contract, must also be changed from 9/30/2010 to 6/30/11.  

Increase is Maximum Order Obligation
The number of projects listed at clause 52.216-19, Ordering Limitations, paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are changed from ten (10) to thirty (30).

CLARIFICATIONS
Service Contract Act Wage Determinations
Due to the fact that specific occupational code titles are not listed for real estate transaction professionals, the Administrative Support and Clerical Occupations codes such as 01020, 01051, 01052, 01111, 01112, or 01113 as the offeror deems appropriate.  If an offeror does not believe that any of these titles are appropriate, they should request a conformance action as detailed on the last page of each wage determination.  This includes providing proposed occupational title(s) and proposed rate(s) with their offer.

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: (i) technical capability of the item quoted to meet the Government requirement (ii) customer responsiveness and (iii) price.  Technical capability and customer responsiveness will both be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A quote that is considered technically unacceptable or a quoter that is determined to have inadequate customer responsiveness shall be ineligible for award.  Customer responsiveness will be assessed based on past dealings between the quoter and the customer; Naval Submarine Base Point Loma.  If the quoter has never dealt with this customer before they will be considered responsive for award purposes.  Alternate customers apart from Naval Submarine Base Point Loma will not be surveyed to make a customer responsiveness determination.  The lowest priced quote that is determined to be technically acceptable and submitted by a company with acceptable customer responsiveness shall be selected for award.  (b) Options (not applicable).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

Quoters shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. The price proposal shall state the unit cost and total price of the item required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant.  Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make a quoter ineligible for award.

The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3.  More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.

<ARCHDATE>07162010
<CONTACT>Jaclyn K Woods
<DESC>Amend #11. On S3, it mentions "field bend #4 rebars existing". Is this an action we have to perform or is this left from the original plans?
Informational from the original plans so the contractor knows what is there.
2. I was wondering if the engineering firm had calculated the reaction at the end of one of these girders (dead load only). It would be helpfulin determining what I would use to raise the end of the beam. Or, if they could provide the weight of the beam /foot or the flange and web thickness or cross sectional area, I could go from there.
BLM does not have historical design information of the bridge weight, nor specific sizes or weights of the beam, so it would be up to the Contractor to make their own estimation if needed. 
3. Would we be allowed to use a hammer drill to drill the 24 - 1" holes for the plate collar?
A hammer drill can be used for the concrete.  However, if excessive damage occurs to the concrete due to the hammer drill in the first hole or so, another means should be requested.
4. Warranty- The engineering firm has far more expertise  than myself but putting 24 - 1" holes into a failed concrete pier just scares me. My experience with small concrete patches such as this one tells me there could be a problem. I would expect the crack to return in less than a year even with the confinement collar. It is a difficult repair but I don't want to be held responsible if a crack returns within a year. Thisfailure - crack could have been caused by a cold joint, rapid dehydration from the sun in the west or improper curing, impact load or other and it will likely show up again.
This concrete has been there for a significant amount of time.  We expect that the crack has occurred due to shrinkage/expansion in the steel girder and is due to the lack of confinement steel.  By cutting the slip holes in the girder, we do not expect this to show up again unless the holes get filled and the girders can't slip in the future.

<DESC><p>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking potential sources with the ability to upgrade the E2-C Legacy Training System to include modification, delivery, installation, and support of training devices and associated training products. This will be the last modification contract for the E2-C Legacy Training System before the start of the Weapon System sunset period. The period of performance for this effort will be approximately seven years starting in FY-11.</p>
<p>The affected training devices consist of two E-2C Weapons System Trainers (WST) Devices 15F8H-4 &amp; 15F8H-5, located at Naval Base Norfolk, VA, and Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) Pt Mugu, CA, respectively, and one E-2C Simulated Maintenance Trainer (SMT) Device 11H177 located in Norfolk, VA. All of these devices are classified SECRET NO FOREIGN during operation.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this procurement is to provide Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA 205 / PMA 231 and training system customers Commander, Airborne Command Control and Logistics Wing (COMACCLOGWING) and the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training (CNATT) with modifications to these training products to include:</p>
<p>a. Weapons System Concurrency: Hardware and software upgrades to reach and sustain concurrency (through life of the contract) with the respective E-2C weapon system changes, including the incorporation of Operational Flight Program(s) (OFP) SCS 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0; HF Radio Upgrade; Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT); and other Aircraft ECPs.</p>
<p>b. Technical Refresh: Increase trainer operational availability and reduce operational and maintenance costs by providing hardware and software upgrades for device(s) technical refresh, for incorporating Training Equipment Change Requests (TECR), and for increasing system commonality within these and other E2 training devices / systems.</p>
<p>c. Training and Readiness (T&amp;R) Credit Enhancements: Increase capability to deliver T&amp;R credit through the training continuum by providing hardware and software upgrades to improve simulation fidelity for weapon sensor systems, communication systems, target dynamics performance, and instructor / operator capabilities.<br /><br />d. Information Assurance (IA): Increase operational security through integration of IA controls and deliver with an Authority to Operate (ATO) accreditation package.</p>
<p>This effort will require maintaining concurrency with E-2C Weapon System upgrades and modifications in development. An initial set of system data will be provided as Government Furnished. Then the contractor will be required to interface with multiple weapon system vendors to obtain the necessary system data to develop these modifications. Also in order to minimize impact to device availability for training, the contractor will be required to set up a System Integration Laboratory (SIL) for modification kit development and in-plant testing. The modification kit will then be delivered, integrated and tested on-site.</p>
<p>The WST devices provide tactical training and operations and employ three-seat trainee stations that replicate the Combat Information Center (CIC) of the aircraft; five instructor stations for set-up and operating the training scenarios; a pilot station for pilot control of navigation and scenario participation; trainer inputs/outputs (I/O), uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system, and Trainer Monitoring and Recording system.</p>
<p>The SMT device provides maintenance and troubleshooting training for technicians and replicates the aircraft's cockpit, CIC and system components located in the Forward Equipment Compartment (FEC), and aft equipment compartment (AEC). The SMT has one IOS station for instructor control and to initiate malfunctions and faults.</p>
<p>The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Diane D. Conarroe, via email at diane.conarroe@navy.mil or by telephone at (407) 380-4032.</p>
<p><br />CAPABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE</p>
<p>1. Given the type of work and the scope of the effort and considering that <br />contract award is scheduled for August 2011 with a period of performance of 7 years, is your company interested in competing for this work as the prime contractor or performing as a subcontractor?</p>
<p>2. Describe your experience with obtaining system data from multiple weapons system vendors to achieve training system concurrency.

<DESC>Q1: I was looking at Addenda K, Page 78 Para. a (2), and the small business size standard is listed as $25M but the FBO solicitation indicates a size standard of $7M. Is this being set aside to small businesses at $25M or below or $7M or below.<br />A1: Section K of the solicitation is incorrect adn will be corrected. The NAICS for this requirement is 488190 with a size standard of $7M.

In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder NNJ10JD03T was issued under Contract NNJ09JE44C, the Aircraft Maintenance andModification Program (AMMP) Contract, to procure services in support of Phase 2 of aproject for NASA's high altitude research aircraft, the WB-57.	Phase 2 services to beprovided under NNJ10JD03T:  leading edge hardware procurement and manufacturing; andengineering design for miscellaneous aileron parts, associated wing hardware, and anaileron assembly fixture.  NASA/JSC has the only two WB-57s flying in the world.  Thisaircraft is a 40+ year old, highly modified aircraft used for upper atmospheric samplingand remote sensing.  Servicing, repairing, and operating these aircraft present dauntingchallenges.  The AMMP contract was awarded on a non-competitive basis because only CSChas the management, engineering, and maintenance organizations capable of working withcritical payload, maintenance, and logistical idiosyncrasies of these aircraft.  Formanufacture/refurbishment of the ailerons, only CSC has the unique engineering knowledgeof this aircraft required to review existing drawings, develop wing contours, solidmodeling, and making detail drawings for the manufacture/refurbishment of the ailerons onthe required schedule.	This Task Order was issued under a cost-type arrangement inaccordance with the contract.  A cost-type arrangement is appropriate due touncertainties involved in contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimatedwith sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.  In addition, acost-type contract was selected to provide the contractor the greatest incentive forefficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  TheAMMP Contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate theGovernment's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Recovery Act in the mostprudent business manner, within the time constraints imposed, the existing AMMP Contractis the most appropriate contract vehicle for the work required.

<DESC>RECOVERY This action will be partially funded by the American Reinvestment andRecovery Act (ARRA) and is the result of a competitive selection under the NASAHeadquarters released NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled "Research Opportunitiesin Aeronautics (ROA) 2009," NNH09ZEA001N.  The contract will support the FundamentalAeronautics Program strategy of developing systems level multidisciplinary capabilitiesfor supersonic civilian and military applications.  The Supersonics Project is abroad-based effort designed to develop knowledge, capabilities and technologies thatsupport vehicles that fly in the supersonic speed regime with a focus on eliminating theefficiency, environmental and performance barriers to practical supersonic cruisevehicles.  Specifically, the Contractor shall design and execute an experiment to gather datarelating the annoyance of community residents to sonic boom exposure consisting ofmultiple low-boom events generated by existing aircraft.  The Contractor shall acquiredata to enable a thorough evaluation of the survey methods used, data acquired, andanalysis methods employed.  The effectiveness of the test methodology for communityresponse testing shall be demonstrated.  A major focus of the Project is eliminating the efficiency, environmental and performancebarriers to practical supersonic air transportation. One of the projects initial researchconcentrations is the development and validation of sonic boom reduction technologies andrelated vehicle design and analysis processes that could reduce sonic boom noise tolevels that allow supersonic flight over land while maintaining adequate efficiency ofoperation. This award is consistent with NASA's continuing investment in high-risk, cutting-edgetechnologies and is responsive to congressional direction to conduct research ontechnologies that will enable commercial aircraft to fly over land at supersonic speeds.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER CONTRACT NO. AG-3A75-C-09-0022.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Task Order No. AG-7482-D-10-0003 to URS Corporation, under Contract No. AG-3A75-C-09-0022.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design:  
	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)
 "MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF GOVERNMENT OWNED DA VINCI ROBOTIC SURGICAL SYSTEM"


1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as requested by the VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHS), will enter into a service contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Sole source contractor shall provide maintenance and repair of Government owned Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System to the VALBHS under the terms and conditions of a service contract.

3. Description of Requirement: VASDHS is requesting a sole source service contract from Intuitive Surgical Inc. The period of performance is July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011 with the Government's option to exercise four (4) additional option years.  The estimated for cost for five years is $725,000.
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1 (c) (1). 

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System was purchased on March 30, 2009 with a one year warranty from Intuitive Surgical and procured through Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and Far Part 13.5, Test Program. Intuitive Surgical Inc. is the manufacturer of the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System and is able to provide software upgrades, and maintenance and repair of the equipment.  This equipment cannot be properly maintained without access to the company's proprietary software and licensed information which cannot be acquired through any third party source. This Government owned equipment costs $1.2 million and is vital to the surgeries. Additionally, if this contract is not procured, and if one of the robotic arms breaks, it could cost the Government $45,000 to replace it. Furthermore, any mistake in maintenance and repair of the equipment would have a negative impact on the health and welfare of the veteran patient and could lead to death. 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See item Number 5 above.  A notice will be transmitted to the GPE (FedBizOpps) from April 12, 2010 through April 23, 2010. This procurement has been solicited for the VA San Diego, Albuquerque and Tucson in September of 2009 and there were no responses.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost should be fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past prices paid for similar services. VA San Diego, Albuquerque and Tucson are currently procuring the same maintenance and repair service contract for the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System with the same price for a base plus four option years.  There is no fluctuation in prices as this is the flat maintenance and repair rate.  

8. Results of Market Survey: Market research information was also obtained through the GSA website.  Intuitive Surgical is not on the Federal Supply Schedule and is currently in the process of

obtaining a contract through the National Acquisition Center. See Item Number 5 above. 

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Item Number 6 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that expressed in writing an interest in the service.  See Item Number 6.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The anticipated life of the Government Equipment is estimated to be twenty (20) years. The Government plans to maintain this equipment for the next twenty years to maximize usage of the system. In order to overcome barriers to competition, the Government shall research other surgical equipment before the procurement of a new system. Since the software is proprietary, overcoming the barriers for competition cannot be realized at this time.

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  Puget Sound Seattle VA  Medical Center

2.  Description of Action:  This justification for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a Philips Medical Engineer to come on-site to troubleshoot and fix the currently inoperable Angio X-ray system.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This requirement is for Biomedical repair service for the Angio X-ray System used in Radiology for invasive diagnosis. The vendor will send a repair technician to troubleshoot, and repair the inoperable equipment. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will 
 		Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, 
		or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(C)(ii)(A) and (B) The parts needed for troubleshooting are OEM parts and only these parts will fit on this equipment. These parts are specifically designed for the Versions of Subsystems and Model of the Angio System owned by the VAMC.  The parts needed are only available from Philips Medical. The vendor will only utilize the parts needed for the repair and invoice only for what is used.  IAW FAR 6.302-2(a)(2)(b)(2) delay in the award of this requirement will delay treatment of Veterans requiring Angio X-Rays.  This delay could result in serious injury to the Government and its ability to service its Veterans.

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2) the proposed contract action is urgent and compelling.  The requesting service contacted two different vendors, DITEC and RSTI before but they have to fly here from Cleveland and buy the parts from the original MFG. Hines Illinois which is a VAMC Service center do not stock these parts and there is no known secondary source.  

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 34,200.54.  This is an estimate and the actual cost can be less than this amount. IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) Pricing is determined fair and reasonable based on evaluation of several repairs done for the VISN by this vendor, historical pricing is consistent with the quoted rates of the vendors quote.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  Repair of the Angio X-ray system requires OEM  parts designed to fit in the Philips V5000 Angio System. FSS sources were sought via VA Advantage which produced no results.
                                               
9.  Other Considerations: Quoted price represents three components which are not all expected to be utilized.  Actual invoices shall reflect what is actually installed which is expected to result in a significantly lower overall price. 

10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  VA PUGET SOUND HEALTH CARE SYSTEM/SEATTLE DIVISON, 1660 South Columbian Way, Seattle WA 98108 

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the  procurement, fabrication, alteration, exchange of appliances and moving of existing kitchen and dining room fixtures in the new American Lake Nursing Home (CLC) .

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Alteration of new equipment in the Nursing Home Kitchen/Dining Area and moving existing equipment from building 3 and set-up in the Nursing Home Kitchen.  This work is a follow on to work awarded in support of the CLC.  

4.	Statutory Authority:  
(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will 
Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(C)(ii) The supplies and services provided by the vendor are a logical follow on to previously awarded contract for the development of the CLC Kitchen.  IAW FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(C)(ii)(A) and (B) competing this action would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Market research of previous acquisitions associated with the CLC indicate other vendors are not willing to provide adequate credit and exchange terms to the Government for the kitchen equipment associated with this procurement.  The requirement must be completed by 15 June 2010, it has been determined that competing these requirements would result in an unacceptable delay in completion.     
?

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Market research based on previous competed acquisitions in support of the CLC Kitchen have indicated there is not sufficient competition available willing to offer credits and exchange equal to the offeror in order to complete renovations, modifications and changes needed for the CLC kitchen project. 

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $42,981.00.  Price is determined fair and reasonable IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) based on previous acquisitions made recently where the vendor has exchanged kitchen equipment offering a credit for equipment already purchased to be used on current acquisitions, competition has proven that other vendors have not been willing to make the same concessions for the Governments business.  13.106-3(a)(2)(vii) prices offered by the vendor include relocation of previously installed counter tops, fixtures and equipment which were satisfactorily installed but require relocation due to changing requirements at no cost to the Government.  It is the determination of the Contracting Officer that the prices listed on this acquisition are fair and reasonable and represent the best value to the Government.


8.	Market Survey (FAR 10): Recent purchases for similar work have indicated the current vendor is the only local vendor willing to offer credit and exchange of equipment.  Market Research indicates there is not a reasonable expectation to find another vendor willing to perform this requirement offering terms favorable to the Government.  Because of the tight time constrains, the Kitchen/Dining facilities are to open 6/14/10.  According to Market Research, this company is the only vendor in our area who can meet our schedule.  The use of another vendor not familiar with this equipment would delay the opening.


9.	Other Considerations:  IAW FAR 6.303-2(9)(ii) it is estimated the costs to the Government would be increased by $10,000-$15,000 if concessions were not offered by the vendor.

10.	 Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No other vendors expressed interest in writing.

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Subsequent acquisitions shall be conducted full and open in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
?

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
