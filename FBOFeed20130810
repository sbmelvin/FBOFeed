<CONTACT>Kristopher J. Ramsey, Phone 2027673782, Email Kristopher.Ramsey@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC><p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) anticipates negotiation of a competitive level-of-effort contract for technical services for research and development (R&amp;D) in the physical, engineering, and life sciences. The Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) Branch aims to make both immediate and long-range contributions to the advancement of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) programs. These R&amp;D programs apply state-of-the-art techniques and system concepts to optimally achieve program objectives. These development efforts encompass all related phases of engineering including applied research of emerging techniques and components, conceptual design and analysis, detailed hardware/software design, modeling and simulation, and prototype development.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide personnel to perform research for the ESM Branch in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; RF Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) Hardware Integration<br />&bull; Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Software Development<br />&bull; Electronic Support (ES) Software Development<br />&bull; Software Subsystem and System Testing<br />&bull; Configuration Management and Control</p>
<p>In the performance of some of the tasks contract personnel may occasionally travel to support system installation, maintenance, or testing aboard Navy platforms.</p>
<p>All Contractor personnel shall possess a favorably completed DoD investigation and a final DoD granted Top Secret security clearance with eligibility of SCI access at time of proposal submission.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for the acquisition up to three years of technical services. The performance work statement will be available as part of the solicitation. Any resultant contract is anticipated to be a cost plus fixed fee contract.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be procured in a competitive negotiated environment using formal source selection procedures set forth in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be 100% set-aside for small businesses in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2, Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources.</p>
<p>The NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided.</p>
<p>Be advised that failure to register in the SAM database makes an offeror ineligible for award of DoD contracts. Information regarding this registration may be obtained by accessing the website https://www.sam.gov. Notification of any changes to the solicitation (amendments) shall be made only on the FebBizOps website. Therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the internet sites daily for any posted changes to the solicitation plans and specifications.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a single award to offeror that represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Instructions and evaluations factors will be provided in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which&nbsp;shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The Material Measurement Laboratory's Multiplexed Biomolecular Science Group at NIST conducts research in all aspects of measurement science, technology development, and standards for measurements where biological state is related to the contemporaneous levels of many biomolecules; establishes methods for asserting traceability, assessing measurement uncertainty, and validating measurements for multiplexed measurands; establishes approaches for measurement assurance of multiplexed and multivariate measurands, including standards and methods development; participates and leads relevant standards organizations and international bodies to develop and promulgate standards for and approaches to multiplexed and multivariate measurement assurance; develops multiplexed metrology for all facets of biochemical science, including clinical, pharmaceutical, biological and biomedical research, forensic, and homeland security applications.</p>
<p>The Multiplexed Biomolecular Science Group requires DNA from four genomes from the Personal Genome Project (PGP) for the prospective NIST Reference Materials (RMs) "Human DNA for Whole-genome Variant Assessment." The Genome in a Bottle Consortium determined by consensus that this particular DNA (GM24143/GM24149/GM24385/GM24631) is needed for the prospective RM since these are the only available cell lines that are part of father-mother-child families using the comprehensive informed consent from the Personal Genome Project. This consent will allow for broad commercial application and distribution of the prospective RM.</p>
<p>Coriell Institute for Medical Research is the only vendor capable of providing the required DNA from the GM24143/GM24149/GM24385/GM24631 cell lines in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Coriell Institute for Medical Research is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>

Additional requirements will be addressed when implemented.</p>

In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.
