<RESPDATE>082508
<CONTACT>James D. Sprandel, Phone 202-521-4071, Email sprandelj@mcc.gov
<DESC>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created by the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 and funded under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004.  The MCC was created in February 2004 and employs approximately 300 staff members.  The MCC mission is to work internationally with some of the poorest countries in the world.  

To work effectively with the recipient countries, MCC outsources administrative operations that are not essential to meeting its mission.  Therefore, in keeping with its mandate and federal guidelines encouraging shared service centers, MCC receives financial management services from a federal center of excellence.  
 
The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) for the Millennium Challenge Corporation.  

MCC is seeking to improve the operations of its current financial management system by expanding the scope of its associated modules and improving the efficiency of the system.  This will improve the effectiveness of its financial management operations and respond to Office of Management Budget (OMB) concerns.  More specifically, the purpose of an enhanced financial management system is to address MCCs challenge to:  

1.	Improve the overall quality of financial management support for its operations,
2.	Manage MCC costs effectively by incorporating cost accounting into its financial management system, 
3.	Become compliant with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-127 Revised, Financial Management Systems by ensuring full interoperability of the applications supporting its business operations, and
4.	Ensure that MCC has the reports it needs to enable better business management.

The MCC intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) MCC-08-RFP-0121 for the hosting and implementation of a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) fully Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and daily accounting operations support.  MCC has determined that the IFMS will require the following services:

1.	Financial Management System Support and Operations
	    (Integration Services and Software Licenses,
	     Hosting Services, and
	     Helpdesk Operations) and 

2.	Accounting Operations
	     (Financial Statement Preparation and Reporting, 
	     General Accounting, and
	     Financial Transaction and Payment Processing).  

To fully support MCC operations, the IFMS functions and modules should include, at a minimum:

1.	General Ledger Management and Financial Reporting, 
2.	Ad hoc Reporting and Data Analysis Tool,
3.	Accounts Payable and Payment Management,
4.	Accounts Receivable,
5.	Fixed Asset Management,
6.	Budgetary Control, Budget Formulation,
7.	Cost and Projects Accounting, 
8.	Travel Accounting and Cost Management,
9.	Credit Card/Purchase Card Management, and 
10.	Automated Procurement Writing System.  

The selected provider must be capable of delivering a federally compliant solution at a competitive cost.  The IFMS acquisition will include the procurement of all necessary materials and services to implement, operate, manage, and maintain the desired federally compliant financial management system environment.  Data migration from the current service provider to the new financial management system environment as well as training of MCC personnel on the new financial system environment will be a part of this acquisition.

In accordance with the guidance provided by OMB for the Financial Management Lines of Business, MCC will utilize Federal or commercial shared service centers or non-governmental qualified providers for financial system hosting services and transaction processing.

This acquisition will be competed using full and open competitive procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, to the offeror whos negotiated proposal represents the best value to the Government.  MCC intends to award a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract utilizing a two-year base period with 4 two-year option periods.  The solicitation is open to all U.S. businesses and U.S. governmental entities.
 
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611  Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.
 
MCC anticipates posting the solicitation on the FEDBIZOPPS website on July 15, 2008.  The anticipated proposal receipt date is August 25, 2008.

Background information on the Study is available on the NCS website www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov. The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on child health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors that could influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The broad range of outcomes includes obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Studys goal is to better understand the role of how exposure and genetic factors affect or are associated with childrens health, disease and development.  The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in U.S. beginning with early pregnancy or before and following the child for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age.

Additional samples to be stored in the Repository will consist of prepared ampuled specimens and environmental samples, such as digestates and extracts, residual biological specimens and environmental samples.  These specimens and samples are considered precious national resources such that their handling, security, and storage must be subject to the most stringent requirements to preserve their identity, quality and integrity.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks: (1) receive, secure, catalog, and store all NCS specimens, samples and records submitted by NCS study centers or analytical laboratories; (2) maintain specimens, samples, and records in appropriate secure storage facilities that will retain their identity, integrity and quality, even in the event of a natural or man-made disaster; (3) prepare, aliquot, and package biological specimens and environmental samples for subsequent analysis; (4) provide shipping materials, shipping services, and technical assistance to ship specimens and samples to laboratories for analysis; (5) develop and maintain a quality assurance program for all Repository operations including personnel management and specimen and sample receipt, shipment, and storage according to all Federal, State, and local regulations, and (6) develop and maintain an automated electronic tracking system to receive, inventory, process, and track specimens and samples that is compatible with the NCS Information Management System.  

To serve as a Repository for the Study, interested offerors must have:

i.  Extensive experience managing large biological and environmental sample repositories.
ii. Experience in receiving, processing, storing, and archiving biological specimens (such         as blood, urine, hair, nails, buccal cells, breast milk, meconium, cord blood, umbilical cords, and tissues such as placenta) under biosafety level 2 (BSL 2) conditions.  
iii. Experience in receiving, processing, storing, and archiving environmental samples such as  soil samples, air sampling filters, water, bulk household dust, prepared samples (ampulated    extracts) and special samples (such as floor mats, food).

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

**** CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is 100% set-aside for 8(a) eligible firms in Region IV, including GA, AL, FL, MS, NC, SC, KY and TN ONLY.  The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of two Multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts. Contract limits and contract size will be determined at the time of selection. Typically, each contract will consist of a base ordering period and four option periods, each period not to exceed one year, for a total of five years maximum. An option may be exercised before the expiration of the base contract period (or option period) if the contract amount has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. The total amount of each contract over the five-year ordering period may not exceed $5,000,000. Task Orders to be executed under this contract will be primarily for projects with a value no greater than $5 million. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the performance risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Award will be made to the firm(s) determined to be most highly qualified. The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based upon the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC contracts, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, (3) Proximity of the firm to the project site and familiarity with design criteria/codes and construction methods used at the locality (4) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The NAICS is 541330; size standard $4.5 million. Work will predominately consist of providing value engineering services by following the Value Engineering methodology expressed by the Society American Value Engineers using simple Value Engineering Study Reports.  This primarily consists of utilizing the five-step value engineering job plan consisting of the Information Phase, the Speculative Phase, the Analysis Phase, the Development Phase and the Presentation Phase. These concepts will be applied to facilities in any phase of the design process.   Other work may include preparation of reports, studies, project planning, design criteria, preparation of drawings and specifications, cost estimates, and other general A-E services for multi-disciplined new construction and renovation projects for military and other government agencies. This work can consists of the design of new vertical construction on facilities commonly found at military installations (barracks, dining facilities, offices, training facilities, equipment maintenance facilities, labs, etc.) as well as some smaller horizontal construction projects (airfields, roads, ranges, etc.). The firm may be required to provide construction phase and other services that may include preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, shop drawing review, and commissioning/start-up/fit-up design support. All design CADD files must be delivered in the (*dgn) format. All design must comply with the Savannah District Design Manual and individual Installation Design Guide. 
****SELECTION CRITERIA: Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: *Significantly More Important* means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. *More Important* means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. *Equal* means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. For this solicitation, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence and Past Performance are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Key Personnel, Work Management and Volume of DoD Contract Awards. Key Personnel, Work Management and Volume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally. Each criterion should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK in lieu of other offices/employees for firms in multiple locations. For firms that have offices in multiple locations, evidence of meeting the criteria should be presented for the office and/or employee that would actually be performing the work in response to this announcement. It is recognized that for firms with multiple locations, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. If more than one office is represented, the Selection Board will consider under the Work Management Plan the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects.

<DESC><p><span style="color: #000000;">The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues this sources sought notice to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>capable of providing serological analysis along with secure, controlled access, office and laboratory space for approximately 10-15 people. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I. Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory was created in 1932 and is one of the largest and most comprehensive crime laboratories in the world. The Laboratory gained initial accreditation through the legacy program of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board in 1998. In 2008 the FBI Laboratory satisfied the ISO 17025 requirements within the international accreditation program of that same organization. The FBI Laboratory provides forensic and technical services to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies at no expense to these agencies. Analyses of physical evidence ranging from blood and other biological materials to explosives, drugs, and firearms are conducted by the Laboratory. In addition, the FBI manages the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a software system designed by the FBI which enables local, state, and federal crime laboratories to exchange and compare DNA profiles electronically, thereby linking crimes to each other and convicted offenders. The DNA Analysis Unit I (DNAAUI) of the Laboratory provides serological and nuclear DNA testing services to all Federal agencies, United States Attorneys, military tribunals, duly constituted state, county, and municipal law enforcement agencies in the United States, territories of the United States or other countries in conjunction with criminal and counterterrorism investigative matters. Since 2001, the primary mission of the FBI Laboratory and correspondingly the DNA Analysis Unit I (DNAAUI) has been to provide analytical testing services to support counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism and FBI investigations. Recognizing the FBI Laboratory's primary focus for the prevention of terrorism activities, timely processing of criminal investigation submissions from state and local law enforcement agencies, such as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for the District of Columbia, have become increasingly difficult to achieve. Additionally, the MPD has identified to the FBI Laboratory the existence of a backlog of non-suspect cases for which submission to the FBI Laboratory has not yet occurred. Such a volume of non-suspect cases, in addition to existing MPD casework which falls outside of the FBI Laboratory's mission, exceeds the current DNAAUI work force resources. Therefore, the DNAAUI is seeking to select a contract laboratory to perform serological, STR and Y STR DNA analysis on a guaranteed minimum of 200 cases with an option to increase the total number of cases to a maximum of 3,000. Since 2003, the FBI has been assisting the MPD in the development of forensic laboratory testing capabilities for the disciplines of trace evidence and serology/DNA testing capabilities within the FBI Laboratory. To expand operational capacities for both the MPD and FBI programs, further space will be necessary. To accommodate such program expansions, in concert with the outsourcing services described previously, the selected contract laboratory must also be able to provide on-site laboratory and office space for MPD laboratory personnel as detailed below.</p>

INTRODUCTION.  The Marine Corps is seeking qualified sources for a number of types of unattended ground sensor technologies for counter-sniper and counter-projectile operations.  This capability is required to support persistent operations within an asymmetric environment.    Sensors should be easy to emplace/operate and capable of long periods of unattended operation.  Since individual sensors will typically not be manned, probability of false detection should be low.  Sensors may be co-located with a sensor monitoring station, either ground or tower mounted, or they may be installed up to five kilometers from the monitoring station.  For either case, sensor alerts and data (as required) are transmitted back to the monitoring station.  For situational awareness purposes, the emphasis is on minimizing the time from alarm at the sensor to alarm reception at the monitoring station.  Operational considerations make cabling between sensors and the monitoring station impractical for this application.  As a minimum, sensors should incorporate a wireless path for data transmission between sensor and the central monitoring location.  Sensors are required in both rural and urban deployments.  Assume a desert environment.  Repeaters are allowable.  Sensors may be deployed at night as well as during daylight hours.  The emphasis is on minimizing the installation and setup time for individual sensors.  Mature sensors and system architectures (Technology Readiness Level 7 or higher) are desired.   Sensor systems that support standard non-proprietary data and Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces are desired as the selected sensor(s) will probably be incorporated into already existing sensor systems with different sensor types.  REQUIREMENTS.  Sniper Detection.  The Marine Corps is interested in procurement of technologies to detect and localize enemy gunfire, including passive Infrared (IR) flash detection technologies and passive acoustic detection technologies.    Sensor shall detect and localize rifle fire within a 360 degree arc at ranges up to 500 meters from the sensor.  Sensors shall operate a minimum of 5 days unattended. The power source selected for the sensor shall be compliant with applicable MIL STD requirements for that power type.  Installers shall be able to (a) mount the sensor to a tower and (b) mount the sensor on the ground.  Sensor mounting shall be accomplished by one man without strain in accordance with MIL-STD-1472.  The sensor shall be capable of transmitting alerts and sensor data (as required to localize the gunfire location) up to five kilometers from the sensor site via wireless communications.  Artillery, Rocket and Mortar Detection.  The Marine Corps is interested in Passive Acoustic technology to support detection and localization of artillery, rocket and mortar firing locations.  Minimum mission duration, power source and mounting requirements are the same as those provided above for sniper detection technologies.  Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.  Individual Sensors may be deployed stand-alone or in close proximity to other Sensors/ sensor systems.  The Sensor System RF architecture employed shall allow for multiple sensors/sensor systems to operate in close proximity to each other while minimizing RF interference between the systems.  The vendor shall indicate in his response the frequency band the equipment operates in.  Supportability Requirements.  The system shall provide a means for field installers to verify operation of the individual sensor/cluster locally, within close proximity to the installed sensor.  The installer will be able to perform a quick health/welfare check of the installed sensor/cluster as well as locally receive any alerts generated by the sensor/cluster.  The device the operator uses for local access to the sensors should be small, lightweight, ruggedized and commercially available.  As technology advances, the Marine Corps may wish to incorporate new sensor types into the baseline Sensor Suite.  To facilitate addition of new sensors, the sensor/system architecture shall be non-proprietary.  At a minimum, this means use of only non-proprietary interfaces.  The objective capability shall be non-proprietary interfaces, components, and software.  Sensor data display.  The Sensor System shall come with a software application that allows the operator to collect, analyze, and display the sensor data using an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).  Vendors response should indicate whether raw sensor data or detection reports are sent via the wireless interface and, if detection reports, the message format used.  DESIRABLE FEATURES.  Any sensor within a sensor suite shall be able to determine its geo-location automatically and transmit this data back to monitoring station.  This alleviates the need for the installer to manually record sensor positions.  RESPONSES SOUGHT.  The Government encourages vendors with any or all of the technologies listed above to respond to this INFORMATION REQUEST.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees.  Interested sources should submit the following information: (1) A system architecture drawing showing the components that make up the sensor system, to include not only the sensors but power sources, local control/monitor devices and radio equipment required to send alerts to the remote monitoring station; (2) A list of equipment, with model numbers, to meet the requirements specified above.  The list should note any equipment that is not off-the-shelf, i.e., equipment that must be developed to satisfy this requirement.  The vendor should list the overall Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed equipment and backup information to support selection of that level; (3) A description of the technology used and specifications for each of the proposed sensors.  Specifications would include ranges supported, Probability of Detection, Probability of False Alarm, accuracy of the localization methods utilized and conditions under which these specifications were calculated/measured.  Vendor is encouraged to address algorithms used to improve detection/discrimination/false alarm rate parameters in their response and any filtering used to decrease noise environment in which sensors operate.  Filtering of background noise becomes an important capability when operating the Sensor System in an urban environment; (4) Provide Size, Weight and Power figures for individual units making up the sensor system.  Include details on the proposed power source.  Include any available data on Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean time between Failure (MTBF) on individual system units.  Any data on system Availability and whether data is derived or actual.  Provide environmental specifications on the proposed system components; (5) Rough order of magnitude costs for the offered equipment set.  Provide separate pricing for discrete sensor units or sensor clusters, repeaters, and any base station units required.  Include cost of ancillary equipment such as power sources.  Vendor should provide the cost break quantities where increases in purchased quantity decreases the unit cost of the systems.  Provide a top level schedule showing time from contract award to equipment delivery; (6) Provide quantity of production level units already sold and, if releasable, end user of the equipment; (7) Security.  Vendors response should address any Communications Security and/or Transmission Security features of the proposed system.  Vendors response should address any capabilities built into the sensor to monitoring station data link (as well as the individual sensor interface) to minimize RF jamming; (8) Electromagnetic Compatibility.  Vendors response should indicate how proposed system addresses multiple sensor systems operating in close proximity; and (9) Vendors submission should list any proprietary system components, interfaces and software.  Vendor should also list any data interfaces/standards that their proposed system incorporates that would make this system easier to interface to already existing sensor systems.  Additionally, the response shall identify the respondents business size and any socio-economic programs that may apply.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  All interested parties shall forward the specified documentation that articulates their capabilities to satisfy the requirements contained herein along with a company overview.

STATEMENT OF WORK
U. S. General Services Administration 
Office of Inspector General (GSA OIG), Office of Audits (JA)


BACKGROUND

The OIG (GSA) works to improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of GSA programs and to ensure the integrity of its operations.  The Office of Audits mission is to add value and provide timely, cost effective, professional, and useful products and services to its clients and stakeholders.  Its ultimate goal is to help improve GSA while simultaneously protecting the integrity of its operations.  The Office of Audits works with GSA management and staff, the Congress and its committees, Office of Management and Budget, Presidents Council on Integrity and Efficiency, and others on issues pertinent to GSA and Government-wide to carry out its legislative mandates.  JA auditors perform reviews of GSA programs and operations to identify and address the challenges that face GSA.  Teams, normally consisting of three to five members, perform its major audits.  During these team reviews & performance meetings, story conferencing is used to establish the teams expectations for the forthcoming audit phase and ensure that team members clearly understand individual assignments, milestones, and performance requirements.  These meetings usually involve all team members, are facilitated by a trained facilitator, and are conducted in an open forum environment.  Each review normally includes two story conferences that last for approximately three days each.  The survey assessment phase of the story conferencing establishes the audit objectives and scope, and develops the field-testing methodology.  The subsequent conferencing is a fact-finding process used to quickly gather readily available information without detailed scope verification of supporting information.  The end-of-fieldwork/report writing phase confirms that accomplished fieldwork is sufficient to respond to the audit objectives and, then, formulates the strategy for preparing the audit report which contains descriptions of the work performed, presents any audit findings, and includes recommendations for corrective actions.
JA is continuously exploring ways to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations.  Audit report development and writing continues to be a challenge for the JA staff.  The Office of Audits aims to improve the overall quality of OIGs audit reports and staff report-writing skills, and reduce the frustration frequently associated with audit report writing by providing JA staff with training that includes a user-friendly, how-to approach to expedite the report-writing process.


MAJOR TASKS

The Office of Audits has a need to provide a report development course to its auditors.  This course needs to include discussion of auditing by objective, obtaining necessary audit evidence, holding story conferences to discuss audit findings and structuring the report, and developing a report outline/initial draft in a team environment.  This course is intended to be provided to auditors at all grade levels.  OIG is interested in the possibility of incorporating in-house report writing experts to teach some of the detailed parts of the course.  The purpose of this course is to help our auditors draft reports of high quality within a short timeframe.

The report development course should provide a practical overview of effective and streamlined findings and report development, and report writing skills and strategies, including story conferencing.  This course should be interactive, involve teams of both contract and internal auditors with various skill levels (e.g. from beginners to very experienced).  At the conclusion of the course, the participants should understand and easily implement techniques to facilitate development of effective audit findings, conclusions, and recommendations in audit reports as well as construct reports in a convincing, well organized, and easy-to-understand manner utilizing a team approach.

Hence, the major tasks are as follows:

Task I.	Design and develop a report development curriculum, including story conferencing techniques, to effectively and efficiently develop audit findings, conclusions, and recommendations in audit reports.

Task II. Design and develop a course manual and associated learning aids to instruct auditors in the above curriculum.

Task III. Conduct and present the training course and materials.


Special Skill Required:  desired curriculum- developer/instructor should have prior experience working with Federal Government (Office of Inspectors General experience preferred), understand the OIG mission and have a working knowledge of auditing principles, concepts, terminology, and requirements and standards, including Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards, and be skilled and trained in dealing with diverse audiences (e.g. race, gender; various age groups & personalities, etc.).


DELIVERABLES

1.	An approved report development curriculum to incorporate the skills, techniques, and strategies for development of audit findings, conclusions, and recommendations in audit reports that communicate the above in a convincing, well-organized, and easy-to-understand manner.

2.	An approved course manual and learning aids that incorporate the curriculum and highlights the skills, techniques, and strategies being taught.

3.	Printing and delivery of the course manual and learning aids for each participant for each course.

4.	Present and deliver the approved course(s) and materials.

5.	The first class presented will be a pilot-demo to solicit OIGs feedback & approval.  Gov, will provide prompt response on the overall curriculum & associated course material.  If Gov determines it necessary, this curriculum and relevant materials may be modified.


DATA RIGHT

Gov reserves the ownership for all instrument, data, text-material and AV-aids (learning-aids) generated in the performance of this contract.  The vendor shall not assert, distribute, establish or authorize others to assert or establish any claim to copyright subsisting in any data produced in the performance of this contract without prior written permission of the OIGs Contracting Officer.

VENDOR SELECTIONS 
Interested vendors must reply to the following questions (answers are limited to 15 pages in maximum, in Times New Roman, Font 11):

3.	How does your firms training approach practically communicate and emphasize to participants the requirements and benefits of employing a structured audit process, with established audit milestones, to facilitate major decision points (e.g. setting audit objectives, developing an audit plan, verifying fieldwork, agreeing on the report message)?

4.	Please explain how your firms course would combine concepts of report development and writing from audit objectives, use of story conferencing, and developing/presenting audit findings that could each be their own multi-day course, into one 3-day course?

Tech Approach
5.	How would your firms curriculum teach not just best practices but moreover a methodology for the organization to implement and auditors to follow, and be able to refer to as they go through the report development and writing process?

6.	What source material would your firm rely on for examples for the course, approximately how many examples/exercises do you propose, and what would these exercises/examples be used for?

7.	How does your firms report development and writing approach support teamwork goals while promoting full participation from individual auditors on the team?

8.	How does your firms report development and writing approach build confidence in new auditors while providing assurance to supervisors that audit reports meet all expectations for quality?

9.	How does your firm propose to possibly use key OIG managers as instructors to provide additional guidance, and what parts of the course would you have them teach and why? 

10.	Please explain how your firms report development and writing curriculum is superior to others and instills knowledge and best practices that will remain with the students long after the course is completed to improve their report writing?

The following factors will be considered in evaluating vendors responses:

-	Quality characteristics for the proposed curriculum (such as effectiveness, clarity, user-friendliness, etc. which will enable OIG to implement and its auditors to follow).

-	Quality characteristics for source material (such as examples of excellence, success stories or  lessons learned, and how relevant these are to the formulated learning goals)

-	Proposed approach used to successfully combine the concepts of report development and writing from audit objectives, use of story conferencing, and developing audit findings and drafting the report outline/draft in a team environment within one 3-day course.

-	Vendors overall report development approach.

-	Vendors experience in report development training and former OIG clients (past performance).

-	Vendors overall approach for teaching participants.

-	The potential of the course to build confidence in new auditors and provide assurance to supervisors that audit reports meet expectations.

-	How the vendor and course is superior to that of its competitors.





The OIG plans to select the most qualified 3-4 vendors and request them to submit further Technical & Price proposals.  The final Award determination will be based on an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and price considered.  OIG's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program objectives at a realistic and reasonable price.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Discipline, Denver, CO is conducting on-going research on the range of climatic variability that has occurred in North America over the past several tens-of-thousands of years.  Specifically, numerical analogue techniques are being employed to quantitatively compare assemblages of plant macrofossils with modern plant assemblages to estimate past climatic conditions.  Over the past several years the USGS has worked to establish, map, and verify the relations among the present-day distributions of woody plant species and climatic and/or bioclimatic parameters.  These data will now form the basis for reconstruction of past climatic conditions and changes.
Based on the information at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from the University of Colorado, Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), 1800 Grant St Ste 7, Denver, CO 80203-1186, and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC><BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Anti-Embolism Stockings. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ will supplement the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is August 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Anti-Embolism Stockings, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $59,079.23.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  Anti-Embolism Stocking Thigh (thigh circumference: 23-27 inches and 29 -31 inches long), $6,716.70;  Anti-Embolism Stocking Thigh (thigh circumference: 23-27 inches and 31-34 inches long), $5,970.04;  Anti-Embolism Stocking Thigh (thigh circumference:19-24 inches and 29 -31 inches long $5,603.78,  Anti-Embolism Stockings (calf circumference 14  15 1/2 inches and 18 inches) $4,420.00; Anti-Embolism Stockings Thigh (thigh circumference:  25 -30 inches and 29  31 inches long) $2,616.91; Anti-Embolism Stocking Knee (calf circumference 12  15 inches  and 15  17 inches long) $2,457.25; Anti-Embolism Stocking Thigh (thigh circumference:  16  20 and 29  31 inches long) $2,416.41; Anti-Embolism Stocking Knee (calf circumference 14 -17 inches and 16 -18 inches long) $2,408.25; Anti-Embolism Stocking Knee (calf circumference 16  19 and 16  18 inches long) $1,293.43.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in the Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 18 July 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>The point of contact for this solicitation is Ms. Sarah Allen.  Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Ms. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil.  (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED).  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Ms. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  The TPRB includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); 5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); 6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA; and 7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Anti-Embolism Stockings products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>2.  Anti-Embolism Stockings in the following sizes; small, medium, large and extra-large and in short, regular, and long lengths.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>3.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Anti-Embolism Stockings product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>4.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>6.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  <BR>7.  Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied.  Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.  Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submittals.  Provide literature on the training.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Due to the length of the standardization process CPT members and facilities may be adjusted/changed due to military mission requirements (TDYs Deployments, PCS, etc.) when necessary.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be sent/delivered to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM CST, on the twenty-first calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately six (6) calendar days.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR>1.  The Measuring device and size chart are easy to use.<BR>a. This feature is required to produce proper fit, comfort, and efficacy. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be evaluated using the measuring device and size chart provided by the vendor.<BR>2.  The sewn edges are smooth and non-irritating to the skin.<BR>a. To avoid damaging the skin and causing discomfort.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be evaluated and observed for fit and comfort <BR>3.  Easy to don (maneuver).<BR>a. Saves time and avoid delay in providing patient care.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Each evaluating member will evaluate this clinical feature and will respond by filling out evaluation sheets based on their expertise utilizing the Likert scale.<BR>4.  Available in various sizes.<BR>a. Promotes safe standard of care and accommodates diverse patient populations.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Each evaluating member will evaluate the various sizes that meet the needs of their facility and respond by filling out evaluation sheets based on their expertise utilizing the Likert scale.<BR>5.  Single unit packaging.<BR>a. Saves time and avoid delay in providing patient care.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Each evaluating member will evaluate the clinical features and will respond by filling out evaluation sheets based on their expertise utilizing the Likert scale. <BR>6.  Size and type is easily identified by color code.<BR>a. Provides staff the ability to easily select correct product after measuring.  Saves time.    <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Each evaluating member will evaluate the clinical features and will respond by filling out evaluation sheets based on their expertise utilizing the Likert scale<BR>7.  Patient Safety - Literature supports the toes are accessible for examination.<BR>a. Visual accessibility to toes is required to show the product is not restricting patient circulation.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>c. Each evaluating member will evaluate the clinical features and will respond by filling out evaluation sheets based on their expertise  utilizing the Likert scale.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  5) The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB votes for the best-value of the clinically preferred products. The DSL reviews the basis for the selection and approves the selection.<BR>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS
<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Oxford Instruments America, Inc., of Concord, Maine, for the purchase of a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator that will meet the demands of the Laser Radiometry Project here at NIST, the NIST. This refrigerator will serve as the cooling vessel for the next generation cryogenic radiometer. Oxford Instruments America, Inc. is the only vendor that offers a refrigerator system that employs a "pulse tube" cooler that obviates the need for liquid helium. These characteristics meet our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NIST requirement for a Vericold Dilution Refrigerator that can allow a single vacuum chamber and direct optical access to the mixing chamber, which is not the case in traditional dilution refrigerators. Oxford is the only vendor that sells a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator (VeriCold Dilution Refrigerator DR400-10) that meets the following specifications: cooling power of greater than 400uW at 100mK and a base temperature of 10mK or less.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 11 calendar days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative's (DeVenCI) Critical Information Technology Sector will conduct a workshop on Information Sharing on September 10, 2008 in Arlington, VA. The workshop will provide selected innovative companies who do not normally conduct business with the Department of Defense with an opportunity to make short presentations to DoD representatives about their technologies and products. DeVenCI is looking for companies who have potential solutions in the following areas:

  a. Flexible and secure data sharing
  b. Data services customization (service oriented architectures)
  c. Efficient transitions to broad-band internet (removing obstacles to data sharing)
  d. Next generation portal services and applications
  e. Smarter networks to enable more collaboration

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before July 18, 2008. Selected companies will be responsible for travel and all other expenses associated with their participation in this workshop.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all bids, including bids under which a Bidder would take unfair advantage of the Government or other Bidders, to waive any technical defects in bids, and unless otherwise specified by the Government or by the Bidder, to accept any one item or group of items in the bid, as may be in the best interest of the Government.  Unless the Invitation otherwise provides, a bid covering any listed item must be submitted on the basis of the unit specified for that item and must cover the total number of units designated for that time.

     (a) In the event the Bidder inserts a total price on the item but fails to insert a unit price, the Government will determine the unit price by dividing the total price by the quantity of the item set out in the Invitation.

                      5
Period of time originally allowed arose out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Purchaser, such determination shall be reduced to writing, and a reasonable extension of time for removal shall be allowed.  Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and sever weather.  If the Purchaser is permitted to remove the property after the expiration of the time originally allowed for removal or any additional time allowed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to this clause, the Government, without limiting any other rights which it may have, may require the Purchaser to pay a reasonable storage charge.  The Purchaser shall reimburse the Government for any damage to Government property caused during the removal operations by the Purchaser or his/her authorized representative.

9.  DEFAULT.

     If, after the award, the Purchaser breaches the contract by failure to make payment within the time allowed by the contract as required by Condition No. 6, or by failure to remove the property as required by Condition No. 8, then the Government may send the purchaser a 15-day written notice of default (calculated from date of mailing), and upon Purchasers failure to cure such default within that period (or such further period as the Contracting Officer may allow) the Purchaser shall lose all right, title, and interest which he/she might otherwise have acquired in and as such property as to which a default has occurred.  The Purchaser agrees that in the event he/she fails to pay for the property or remove the same within the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20 percent of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default has occurred, or (b) $25, or purchase price of such item(s) if the purchase price is less than $25: Provided, That in the event of multiple awards of items under a single Invitation for Bids, the amount to be charged, if the minimum charge provided for in (b) above is applicable, shall be determined by the total purchase price reflected in the award documents Provided further, That the maximum sum which may be recovered by the Government as damages for failure of the Purchaser to pay for and remove the property shall be the formula amount.  The Government shall specifically apprise the Purchaser, either in its original notice of default (or in separate subsequent written notice), that upon the expiration of the periods prescribed for curing the default, the formula amount will be retained (or collected) by the Government as liquidated damages.  However, if the property was sold on a per lot basis and the Purchaser removes a portion of the lot but fails to remove the balance, no portion of the purchase price will be refunded.  If the Purchaser otherwise fails in the performance of his/her obligations, the Government may exercise such rights and may pursue such remedies as are provided by law or under the contract.



Section 9 is revised.  See page 19, 
	10.  SETOFF OF REFUNDS.

11.  INTEREST.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, unless paid within 30 calendar days from the date of first written demand, all amounts that become payable by the Purchaser to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest at the rate which has been established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), from the date of the first written demand until paid.

12.  ADJUSTMENT FOR VARIATION IN QUANTITY OR WEIGHT.

Unless otherwise provided in the Invitation, when property is sold by a unit other than weight, the Government reserves the right to vary the quantity tendered or delivered to the Purchaser by 10 percent; when the property is sold by weight, the Government reserves the right to vary the weight tendered or delivered to the Purchaser by 25 percent.  The purchase price will be adjusted upward or downward in accordance with the unit price and on the basis of the quantity or weight actually delivered.  Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Invitation, no adjustment for such variation will be made where property is sold on a price for the lot basis.

13.  WEIGHING, SWITCHING, AND SPOTTING.

     Where weighing is necessary to determine the exact purchase price, the Purchaser shall arrange for and pay all expenses of weighing the property (unless Government scales are available on the premises).

When removal is by truck, weighing shall be under the supervision of the Government and at its option on:  (a) Government scales, (b) certified scales, or (c) other scales acceptable to both parties.  When removal is by rail, weighing shall be on railroad track scales, or by other means acceptable to the railroad for freight purposes.

14.  RISK OF LOSS.

     Unless otherwise provided in the Invitation, the Government will be responsible for the care and protection of the property subsequent to it being available for inspection occurring during such removal.  Any loss, damage, or destruction occurring during such period will be adjusted by the Contracting Officer to the extent it was not caused directly or indirectly by the Purchaser, its agents, or employees.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the adjustment may consist of rescission.  With respect to losses only, in the event the property is offered for sale by the lot, no adjustment will be authorized under this provision unless the Government is notified of the loss prior to removal from the installation of any portion of the lot with respect to which the loss is claimed.

The contractor shall indicate on the SCRAP DELIVERY ORDER, the contractors name, contract number, item number, truck number, date, and to pickup location(s).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number GDQ082012 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) with an open date of June 27, 2008 and close date of July 9, 2008.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 05-25.  This is a total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside under NAICS 238210 and a size standard of $13.0M.STATEMENT OF WORK - ALBUQUERQUE DISTRICT OFFICE (ADO) Cable PlantWithin the ADO, the network switches, DSU/CSU (Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit), and demarcation points exist in the computer room. From the computer room, all network connections are routed through the ceiling and distributed to face plates throughout the building. All wiring initiates from a patch panel in the computer room and is routed up through the ceiling. The cabling then fans out to various parts of the building terminating in the work areas with color coded (orange) modular jacks within a face plate. There are insufficient network drops, resulting in numerous hubs being placed throughout the office to add more network connectivity. The cable plant infrastructure upgrade will provide the ADO with sufficient drops for a managed network.Work Requirements: The ADO Network infrastructure must be flexibility to accommodate future network drops into office work areas. As personnel move, the network connections need to be easily available to IT staff to provide network connectivity. Computer Room Wiring - A new wall rack mount and patch panels need to be purchased and placed on an existing back board. The new rack will house (4) new 48 port patch panels, a Cisco Catalyst 4507R switch and a DSU/CSU.  The patch panels will be T568B-terminated (Figure 1, Proposed Rack Configuration available upon request). Work Area Wiring - Work areas will vary from one to four network drops in each surface mount box encased in a protective raceway. Each surface mount box will be placed in a convenient location for IT personnel to access. The raceways will be spaced strategically in each work area. All raceways shall match the color of the interior of each office. There are instances where drops will run down power poles.  All new cables shall have the same numbering scheme and be labeled the same at each end. All cable runs shall have enough slack to move the wiring 3 feet in either direction.

<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">This shall be a firm Fixed Price contract with a fixed hourly rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The term of the base contract performance period shall begin from the effective date of the award (EDOA) through up to 12 months from the EDOA with four (4) one-year optional performance periods. The length of the contract shall not exceed 60 months. The exercise of any option period is subject to the availability of funds at the time of the exercise of the option. The contractor shall commence full performance of services under the resultant contract within 30 calendar days from the effective date of award of the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The contractor shall provide non-personal services in accordance with FAR Subpart 37.4 - Nonpersonal Health Care Services. Award of this contract will result in a contractual arrangement only and shall not be construed as a personnel appointment with PSA. Payments to the contractor shall be based on the provision of the requirements stated in the Statement of Work (SOW). The contractor will not be subject to direct Government supervision, except for security related matters, but contractor performance shall be closely monitored for quality assurance. The contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance as specified in the solicitation/contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Security Requirements for Contractor Personnel:</strong> All Contractor personnel utilized under this contract shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any PSA/CSOSA facility. The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Background Investigations:</strong> The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work under the contract until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the PSA/CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor. Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a PSA/CSOSA facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below. The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Office of Procurement. The following forms will be provided and must be completed: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form<br />(2) FD 258, "FBI Fingerprint Card"<br />(3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions<br />(4) Contractor's Preliminary Background Check Form<br /><br />It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract. To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. PSA/CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation. If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with PSA/CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">PSA reserves the right to determine suitability of any contractor or contractor employee to work on this contract prior to the employee gaining access to any PSA facility or system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Contractor's Responsibility:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation, unless the Office of Security grants approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position. At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR. Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Government's Responsibility:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant. The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual's presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">All potential offerors are advised that this solicitation includes the clause FAR 52.212-4 (Oct 2003) for Commercial Items, which at paragraph (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR), requires all contractors doing business with the Federal Government after September 30, 2003, to be registered in the CCR database.

<DESC>                              Proposal for Contracting Services  27 June 2008


            LABORATORY STEM HEATING EXPERIMENT AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT

                                                           Synopsis

The Delaware Laboratory of the US Forest Service (Project NRS-02) seeks a contractor to perform laboratory experiments and database management for two projects, the Stem Heating Experiment and the Common Garden Fuels Experiment.  Individuals meeting the minimum requirements set forth herein are invited to submit firm fixed-price proposals to perform the tasks set forth in the Scope of Work using methods as described.  The work must begin by the end of August 2008.  All required work will be completed by 12/31/2009.  Proposals will be evaluated 50% for the firm fixed-price and 50% based upon the non-price evaluation criteria identified below, and listed in descending order of importance.  The government intends to make award to the contractor whose offer is in the best interest of the government in light of both the price and non-price criteria.

Minimum Qualifications

The contractor must posses, at minimum:  Masters Degree in the natural sciences (e.g., Biological Sciences, Forest Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Botany), demonstrated ability to conduct independent experimental research, experience with scientific instrumentation, and experience with designing databases.  Evidence of independent experimental research will include past research experience and related publication record.  A minimum of 3 years experience (including time spent obtaining degree) will be considered as a minimum standard.

Non-Price Evaluation Criteria    

1. Experience working with tree species characteristic of the eastern US.

2. Past performance on similar research projects within the last 3 years (contractor will   provide contact information for past employers to allow recommendations to be obtained).

3. Geographic location:  contractor must live within commuting distance of the Forestry Sciences Laboratory (359 Main Road, Delaware, Ohio 43015) where the laboratory work will be conducted.

4.Personal vehicle required for field work in southeastern Ohio (mileage reimbursed at standard rates).

5.Previous experience with the US Forest Service a plus relative to the contractors ability to conduct the work efficiently.

Scope-of-Work

General objectives:
1.Conduct a series of laboratory trials (the Stem Heating Experiment) that would characterize stem surface heat budgets, stem heating, and tissue necrosis for a range of common eastern tree species over several seasons.  

2.Manage Excel databases for the Stem Heating Experiment and a second field experiment involving forest fire fuel bed development in the Ohio Hills (the Common Garden Fuels Experiment).

Specific objectives:  
1.Stem Heating Experiment

a.Experimental material (trees in the field in southeast Ohio) will be marked for later collection in the first growing season of the experiment (by the end of August 2008).  This work should take approximately one week and will involve cooperation with Vinton Furnace Experimental Forest staff.  Other samples will be obtained by cooperation with research colleagues throughout the east.

b. Each experimental replicate would likely be conducted over three consecutive days.  Stem collection would be carried out on the first day, heating experiments on the second, and tissue necrosis measurements on the third.  Stem heating experiments would be completed over the course of one year or less.  Seasons for sampling would include summer, fall, winter, and spring (preferably early and late spring).  The number of species to be included in the project (target:  N=10), the number of stem heating levels (minimum:  low and high heat flux), and the number of replicate measurements per species and season (minimum N=3) would be determined during initial trial runs.  

c. Contractor will be involved in all aspects of the experiments including setting up and conducting the experiments, collecting, managing, and analyzing the data, summarizing results, helping with manuscript preparation, and other duties as assigned.

d. A minimum expectation for time commitment for this Stem Heating Experiment would be 108 days.  Thus, an efficient work plan and experimental design will be required.  
 
2. Common Garden Experiment

a. Raw data from 18 weather stations downloaded on a monthly basis will be quality checked and placed in a common dataset using Excel.  Contractor will design the dataset to allow comparison among weather stations on a seasonal basis.  Data summaries will be conducted quarterly in order to assure that the data are of adequate quality.

b. A minimum expectation for time commitment for the Common Garden Experiment would be 20 days.

Interested firms meeting the Minimum Qualifications should submit their firm and individual resumes together with a firm fixed-price proposal for the work to the Conctracting Office Addressno later than 4:00 pm local time on Wednesday, July 16, 2008. The Government intends to make award of a single contract to the firm whose proposal most successfully iaddresses the requirements outlined in this solicitation, price and non-price criteria considered

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration is seeking an independent, high quality program evaluation of the Maritime Security Program (MSP) that provides an assessment of the program's impact on the American marine transportation industry and that industry's ability to support U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) sealift requirements.  The results should be generalizable and reproducible.
The Maritime Administration's primary focus is to promote an American marine transportation industry broadly defined to meet the needs of today and tomorrow.  Additionally, the Agency must balance this perspective with a wider range of today's transportation challenges such as congestion, the need for improved intermodal connectivity, improved safety and reduced environmental impact.  The Maritime Administration's priorities reflect the need to improve the U.S. marine transportation system by addressing these systemic challenges. 
  In order to ensure that an active U.S. flag fleet of militarily useful ocean going ships and the crews to operate them will continue to serve both the economic and national security objectives of the U.S., the Maritime Administration administers the MSP.  The operators of U.S. flag MSP vessels receive financial support to partially offset the higher operating cost of keeping these vessels under U.S. flag in exchange for a commitment to provide intermodal sealift capacity to D.O.D in times of national emergency or war.
 The MSP is a crucial part of the Maritime Administration's national security efforts as it helps to assure the availability of the U.S.-flag oceangoing fleet and thousands of skilled mariner jobs that support the commerce and national security of the United States.  The program was initiated in 1996 and was reauthorized in 2005.  The program is currently authorized through 2015.  
 The Maritime Security Program is a crucial part of the Maritime Administration's national security efforts as it helps to assure the availability of the U.S.-flag oceangoing fleet and thousands of skilled mariner jobs that support the commerce and national security of the United States.  The program was initiated in 1996 and was reauthorized in 2005.  The program is currently authorized through 2015.    The Maritime Administration desires a high quality program evaluation of the Maritime Security Program in order to assess the program's effectiveness in achieving the desired results and to provide information that may contribute to program improvement.  This impact assessment must be of sufficient scope [matched to the program's size and complexity] and quality in order to assure that the evaluation accurately demonstrates the program's impact and effectiveness in achieving its desired results.  Since the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prefers that program evaluations be conducted by independent, non-biased parties with no conflict of interest, the Maritime Administration has determined that the evaluation will be conducted by a highly competent third party.
 According to OMB, impact evaluations are the most rigorous form of program evaluation, but also are the type that is most likely to yield meaningful results.  Impact assessments use empirical data to compare measurable program outcomes.  It is possible to evaluate the results that would be expected in the absence of the program.  Both quantitative and qualitative analysis may be used in this evaluation.  However, judgmental approaches alone will not be sufficient for purposes of this evaluation. 
***General description of services to be provided
 The vendor shall provide a high quality program impact evaluation of the MSP effectiveness and to provide information that may contribute to program improvement.  The evaluation must be of sufficient scope [matched to the program's size and complexity] and quality in order to assure that the evaluation accurately demonstrates the program's impact and effectiveness in achieving its desired results.  Impact evaluations are the most rigorous form of program evaluation, but also are the type that is most likely to yield meaningful results.  Impact assessments use empirical data to compare measurable program outcomes with similar subjects that are not affected by the program.  It is possible to evaluate the results that would be expected in the absence of the program, or through the use of alternative programs.  This is accomplished by isolating the effects that are directly attributable to the program and external factors (e.g., political, regulatory, and economic situations) that may limit or enhance the effects of program activities.  
 The preferred type of evaluation is the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).  Some other commonly used methodologies are: Direct Controlled Trials, Quasi-Experimental Studies, and Non-Experimental Analysis (Direct or Indirect).  Both quantitative and qualitative analysis may be used in this evaluation.  However, judgmental approaches will not be sufficient for purposes of this evaluation unless combined with one or more of the above methodologies.  	 The results of this research shall include:
1.  An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in complying with the regulations set forth in 46 CFR Part 296 as well as achieving the Maritime Administration's national  security strategic objective and desired outcome for: "Sufficient surge and sustainment sealift (both commercial and government-owned) and shipyard capacity is available to support DOD deployment requirements."2.  An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in achieving the Department of Transportation's Security, Preparedness and Response strategic goal and desired  outcomes for "Preparedness for emergencies affecting the transportation sector; and effective response to emergencies affecting the transportation sector" and the performance measure "Percentage of DOD-required shipping capacity (both commercial and government-owned) complete with crews available within mobilization timelines."    3.  An assessment of the program design.  Is it free of major flaws that would limit the      program's effectiveness or efficiency?  4. Identification of any areas that the program may need to improve in order to better    achieve the three objectives outlined above.

<DESC><p>The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative was established with the goal of creating technologies, data, reagents and reference materials, analysis systems and infrastructure as a basis for advancing discovery research and clinical applications.  More information about the initiative can be found at http://proteomics.cancer.gov.  As part of the CPTC, a series of renewable and highly characterized affinity binding reagents will be generated and made available to the research community.  Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP's) will be made available along with characterization data through a web portal.  This will ensure that experiments can be both repeated and compared among researchers.</p>
<p>The specific objective of this scope of work is to generate antibodies from antigens already generated under the CPTC. There are forty-two antigens (see list below) that will be used in the generation and screening for new monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>Once a set of antibodies are generated and screened by the contractor for each antigen, the antibodies will be sent to SAIC-F and undergo further screening and characterization including but not limited to Western Blot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), immuno capture and mass spectrometry, and immuno histochemistry (IHC).  The data from all phases of the characterization, i.e. from contractor and other entities selected by NCI will be made public through the associated web portal.  The final antibodies and associated hybridoma cells will be made available to the scientific community through a distributor or repository selected by the NCI.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted via email by 5:00 PM, Friday, July 11, 2008. Please send to Matt DeSantis at desantisma@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with BIOBASE Corporation, 100 Cummings Center, Suite 420B, Beverly, Massachusetts 01915, to acquire a renewal of CITs subscriptions to the following BIOBASE software products and support:  (1) Proteome BioKnowledge Library (BKL) which includes the PROTEOME, TRANSFAC, and TRANSPATH databases; (2) ExPlain Analysis System; and (3) software maintenance and professional training for these BIOBASE propriety software products.  The period of performance shall consist of a Base Period of 12 months with four (4) successive 12-month Option Periods.  Since August 2002, NIH has subscribed to these web-based databases that are used by NIH researches to access yeast genomic and protein information.  These databases serve as resources to provide data regarding mammalian-specific protein-protein interaction data.  The Proteome BioKnowledge Library consists of six database volumes of biological information about proteins.  Each volume focuses on a different organism important in pharmaceutical research.  Proteome scientists manually collect and curate the information in each volume that represents thousands of independent research results.  The database currently contains information about more than 60,000 scientific references on more than 80,000 proteins, including data on protein classification and function.  Subscribers to the database can quickly access available information about proteins of interest and use its search capabilities to reveal biological connections that would otherwise be buried in the scientific literature.  Each volume of the database is updated weekly.  Volumes continually expand as new content is published.  NIH researchers use this tool to analyze current publications regarding yeast, and to validate the results of their research.  The information in the BIOBASE Proteome Database includes predicted properties of the Open Reading Frames (that are not available from any other database source) and scientific literature concerning the gene and its product.  BIOBASEs ExPlain software product is a gene expression analysis platform that promotes biological interpretation of large-scale data, such as gene expression, proteomics and ChiP  chip data.  ExPlain provides the unique ability to generate hypotheses regarding the upstream cause(s) leading to observed gene expression changes.  In particular, ExPlain can identify potential therapeutic targets that are not necessarily part of a differentially expressed gene set.  The methods used by ExPlain go above and beyond traditional signal transduction and gene regulatory network data expressions by considering the molecular mechanism(s) that could have caused the experimentally observed changes in gene expression.  CIT has determined that BIOBASEs Proteome BKL and ExPlain Analysis System, including software maintenance and training support, are the only commercially available software applications that can meet all of the requirements stated above.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide software products that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes.  The contractor shall comply with all other applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:   http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within five (5) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM Synopsis No. 08-154jc shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Joan Coulter at jc224a@nih.gov.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT:
SCOPE:
The Contractor shall provide a trawl vessel with the equipment identified elsewhere in this document; captain and crew; fuel; food and berthing accommodations equal to that of the crew for up to two NOAA Fisheries gear specialists; and all other material necessary to complete the work identified below.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:
Skimmer trawl vessels boats shall be outfitted with a single trawl on both the port and starboard sides of the vessel. Comparative testing of these trawls shall be conducted by sewing the experimental TED into one trawl and leaving the other naked (control).  To prevent side and/or trawl bias, the TED shall be switched every other night from one side to the other.  Latitude, longitude, depth, and boat speed shall be recorded at the start and finish of each successful tow. A tow is defined as successful if the gear works properly and the trawl is hauled in perfect condition.  Tows with TED blockages shall be defined as successful tows since blockage is part of normal fishing conditions that may effect catch retention with a TED installed.  Total catch and shrimp weight for the port and starboard nets shall be recorded.  A select basket of catch from each side shall be examined for further analysis. A standard basket used by commercial fishermen weighs approximately 32 kg when full of catch.  Weights and counts shall be collected for brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus), white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus), and pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum) from the sample basket. The rest of the sub-sample shall be separated into categories and weighed (i.e. other finfish, non-shrimp crustaceans, other non-crustacean invertebrates, and debris). 

In addition to sampling the catch, NOAA Fisheries staff may install camera equipment at various locations throughout the trawl to documents gear performance and fish behavior.  This will require crew assistance and designated work areas on the vessel.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE AND SCHEDULING:
The Contractor shall provide the 8 charter days between July 15, 2008 and October 31, 2008.  

The Contractor shall notify NOAA Fisheries staff regarding availability based on target catch availability and weather.  Once notified, NOAA Fisheries gear specialists will travel to the vessel and meet with the captain to go over gear testing protocols, load equipment, document vessel and trawl parameters and install a prototype TED into one trawl.  When weather permits, the Contractor shall depart for the fishing grounds.  Once the vessel arrives on the fishing grounds, the captain shall begin towing under a 55 minute tow time limit and shall continue around the clock until a 12 hour fishing day is complete and return to port after each work day if feasible.  A minimum of four (4) successful tows must be completed during each contract day.  A successful tow is defined as a trouble-free tow with a minimum total catch of 32 kg per net   Catches for each trawl must remain separate until sampling is complete.  A NOAA fisheries staff member will notify the captain when sampling is completed and will sample each tow and record fishery-specific data on target and non-target species from each trawl.  The Contractor and NOAA Fisheries staff shall continue to conduct trips during this time period until all contract days are completed.

VESSEL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  Skimmer trawl fishing vessel 55 ft in length or larger capable of towing two skimmer trawls that are less than 20 feet wide.

2.  Vessel engine power sufficient to tow two skimmer trawls that are 20 feet wide or greater a minimum of 2.5 kts

The Government will perform a two-step evaluation. In step one, the initial evaluation will ensure that the sample is in compliance with the stated requirements (e.g., made in the USA, location of the embroidery, correct color of the shirt). Any sample not meeting the stated requirements will be found technically unacceptable. Samples meeting step one will then be tested for quality. Quality testing is defined as a durability test. Testing will take three days and will consist of each shirt being worn for one day, then washed, worn a second time for one day, washed, worn a third time for one day, and finally washed a third time. Wash and wear evaluation will be on the lack of shrinkage, minimal fading, the look of the embroidery, the look of the imprint (for each white shirt) and the samples overall durability after three wearing and three washings. Quality ratings will be provided as Excellent, Very Good, Satisfactory (Acceptable), Poor (Unacceptable).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Quality of each item as demonstrated by the sample; (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.

The Government will perform a two-step evaluation.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.
Question:
There seems to be a conflict of words in your RFQ. A shirt can not be 100% polyester and 100% cotton at the same time?

Answer:
The following is provided to clarify.
Current Solicitation states incorrectly:
Fabric: shall be either 100% polyester with x-eede moisture control and anti-microbial technology, weight: 7.25 oz. per square yd. Must feature a 100% smooth cotton fabric that is very soft to the touch, will not shrink, wrinkle or fade and easily accepts embroidery or imprinting. An equivalent fabric or design is acceptable.

Solicitation is amended to read:
Fabric: shall be EITHER 100% polyester with x-eede moisture control and anti-microbial technology, weight: 7.25 oz. per square yd. OR the polo shirt must feature a 100% smooth cotton fabric that is very soft to the touch, will not shrink, wrinkle or fade and easily accepts embroidery or imprinting, OR an equivalent fabric or design is acceptable.

Question:
Is delivery in bulk or will individuals be ordering as needed against an open contract?
Answer:
This requirement is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. It is anticipated that the first order on this contract will be for the entire minimum for each shirt for the base period; after that, orders will be made as needed.

Could you please get me the size of the badge for digitizing?

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.
Question: For a number of the overlays, USSS states the dimension of the overlay and then: (picture target is actually 10.5 inch x 12 inch, need 5.5 inch at top to hang the target). Why does USSS need those extra inches at the top? Why only at the top?
Answer: USSS appreciates your question; the rquirement is as stated. If the offeror must take exception to the requirement, please identify that within your proposal.

Question: Is the delivery address of awarded contract the same address the samples are to be sent?
Answer: The address in the Solicitation is for mailing samples only. For calculating your quote, upon award, delivery will be to zip code 20708. As a reminder, the sample is to be shipped to (do not deviate from this exact address): 
Communications Center (RTC-Langan) 
245 Murray Drive, SW
Bldg T-5
Washington, DC 20223
 
Question: For the samples, since artwork is not available until award, what should be used?
Answer: USSS is providing pictures and sample targets. From the Solicitation:
  A word document containing pictures of each target (but not the backer) and JPEG files of each target will be provided upon email request; please provide your company name, point of contact and specify: pictures. 
  A full size sample target and a piece of the backer will be provided upon email request; please provide your company name, point of contact and postal mailing address and specify which target(s) and/or backer
 
Question: Line item 0001 has specific packing requirements, are there requirements for remaining items?
Answer: All of the targets should be boxed and shipped in flat boxes. Line item # 3 says boxed 100 per case, boxed flat. 100 is the minimum but they can be boxed up to 500 a box. USSS requires that each shipment be on one standard-sized pallet only, not multiple combined pallets. If two pallets are necessary, they cannot be combined.

Question: What can you tell me about probable shipping times and quantities so that I can come up with reasonable shipping costs?
Answer: USSS anticipates placing a Delivery Order for the minimum of each item within 30 days of award of the IDIQ. Should USSS exercise the option, then USSS will place a Delivery Order for the minimum of each item for that option year.

The resultant award will be a firm fixed price construction contract. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the low offeror if the offer is judged to provide the overall best value to the Government. All eligible and responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An offer guarantee will be required when requested by the Contracting Officer.

Telephone requests for information will not be allowed and all technical questions regarding the solicitation must be emailed to ryan.battad@us.af.mil with a courtesy copy to kerry.callahan@andrews.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) long-term contract with QIAGEN Corporation for their HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables to support their Hybrid Capture 2 (Hc2) and Rapid Capture System (RCS), through the use of DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  Currently, QIAGEN Corporations testing systems reside at many of the MTFs on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  QIAGENs HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables provide the only FDA approved option for the MTFs to perform HPV testing.  QIAGENs test kits are specifically configured to support QIAGENs testing systems employed at many of the MTFs.  No other manufacturer or distributor sells or has access to these products manufactured by QIAGEN.  Only QIAGEN has the capability of providing the required items. 
 
During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using QIAGEN Corporations Chlamydia (CT) and Gonorrhea (GC) test kits which operate under the same testing systems as the HPV test kits and will be procured under this solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  QIAGEN will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog for each system-Hc2 and RCS and an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog for each system on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP ECAT system.  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Acknowledgment and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgments, send 855-Order Acknowledgments and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are two communication strategies available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and the American Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI standard for direct EDI.  QIAGEN Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.  

The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $4.9 million.  Solicitation SPM2DE08R0052 is expected to become available July 8, 2008 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board website at www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil .

<RESPDATE>072108
<ARCHDATE>01312009
<CONTACT>Peggy Smith, PCO:  Peggy.L.Smith1@usmc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following clarifications regarding subject BAA:
Q1:  	The 1st page of the BAA states a Proposal due date of 21 July 2008 yet page 5 states a date of 30 June 2008. Which is the correct date?A1:  	The correct date is 21 July 2008. 
Q2:  	Are classified inputs acceptable? We believe we have a relevant technology for Objective C but believe that our approach should have a minimum DoD classification protection. Is your office allowed to receive classified inputs and what submittal directions should be followed?A2:	Classified inputs are acceptable.  They can be provided to the following SIPRNET address 
keenanjp@mccdc.usmc.smil.mil
or sent by registered mail to  
Joint Non-Lethal Weapons DirectorateAttn:  Security Officer3097 Range RoadMCB QuanticoQuantico, VA 22134-5100	
Q3:	From past history is there a typical first phase funding level that would be appropriate for us to develop a BAA submission against and how does that carry forward into follow-on phases? Are there a "typical" number of Phase 1 awards against these types of BAA's?A3:	There really is no typical first phase funding level associated with JNLWP BAA awards.  Past Phase 1 awards have ranged from $300K to $1.5M; however, with only $1.7M available for all FY09 awards under this BAA, your phase 1 proposal should take this limit into consideration.  As for typical number of awards from the JNLWP BAAs, last year's BAA resulted in 12 separate awards totaling $8.9M.  With substantially less funding available to award this cycle, the number of anticipated awards will accordingly be less. 
Q4:	Page 3 cites a "Joint NLW Effects Capability Based Assessment"; how can we acquire that document? A4:	The "Joint NLW Effects Capability Based Assessment" is a For Official Use Only Document, and is not available to the general public.  The capability gaps pertinent to this BAA have already been culled from the assessment and are provided in paragraphs A through H.
Q5:	Two demonstrations are required during the Phase 1 effort - are these normally held at contractor's facilities or at Gov't facilities (e.g., field demonstrations)?A5:	The two demonstrations required during the Phase 1 effort can be held either at the contractor's facility or at a government facility.  Any anticipated funding associated with demonstrating at a government facility should be included as part of your proposal.
 Q6:	Under the Research Description paragraph it states that the Phase 2 effort may be optional. Should we firmly bid Phase 2 effort as an option?A6:	It is highly recommended that you provide a firm bid for the Phase 2 effort.  Any awards will be made against the proposal in total, as proposed. If there are no options and you receive an award, you would need to re-purpose in subsequent years.
