<DESC>Supreme&nbsp;Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the provision of body armor, clothing, and&nbsp;CBRN equipment for deploying civilians.

<p>The bidding procedure will be sealed, one envelope. It is SHAPE's intent to organize at its facilities a Vendors Day before initiating the bidding procedure in order to seek industry input on best practices, market availability, and current standards on protective equipment. The Vendors Day is planned for mid-July 2012; there is, however, no mandatory requirement to participate.</p>
<p>The reference for the&nbsp;IFIB is ACO-SH-12-10 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference.</p>
<p>Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 01 January 2013 - 31 December 2013 with four one-year options.</p>
<p>The classification of the IFIB will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Firms to request that&nbsp;the Department of Commerce issue&nbsp;a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit a completed one-time NATO ICB application): 20 June 2012</p>
<p>Please note that under the stipulations of Bi-SC procurement Directive 60-70, the contracting entity will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list until the bid closing date.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about June 8, 2012.  It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR 2.101.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>his procurement will be set aside for small business in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, Section 12.203 and Part 15. A one year firm fixed price contract, with four one-year options, is planned.  Once the solicitation is released, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description:<br />The Personnel Development Program (PDP) is aimed at increasing the supply of effective personnel in the field of special education. This program awards competitive grants to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) to support scholars receiving training to provide special education and related services to children and youth with disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPRA and IDEA and the related promulgated regulations, i.e., the "Additional Requirements" section of the Personnel Preparation To Improve Services and Results for Children With Disabilities--Combined and Leadership Priorities for Personnel Preparation notice published in the Federal Register on March 25, 2005 (2005 SO Regulations) and the Federal Register 34 CFR Part 304 Vol. 71 No. 107 June 5, 2006, the Service Obligations Under Special Education-Personnel Development to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities (2006 SO Regulations), place requirements on the PDP that require data collection for two main purposes. First, GPRA requires the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) to report performance measure outcome data on PDP grants awarded to IHEs. Second, the Department is required to track the service obligations of scholars/obligees who receive funding from a PDP grant to ensure that they work in the field of special education or related services for a specified period of time or repay part or all of the funding received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three data sets that will be consolidated under this acquisition are: (1) The Scholar Data Report (SDR) which collects most of the PDP performance measure data; (2) the Service Obligation Tracking System (SOTS) which tracks the eligible employment of scholars who have received funding from most of the PDP training grants awarded by OSEP; and (3) the Consortium data from grants awarded by OSEP to prepare educators with expertise in the education of students with sensory impairments. For further information about these entities, visit: https://oseppdpprs.ed.gov for SDR, http://www.serviceobligation.org for NCSO, and http://www.salus.edu/nclvi/fellows.htm and http://www.salus.edu/nlcsd/ for the Consortium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Performance Work Statement includes an option to extend the existing SOTS to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's Office of Indian Education (OIE) for use with its Indian Education Professional Development (IEPD) Discretionary Grant Program.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.

(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <BR> <BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<SUBJECT>The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Regional Vendor Model

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) seeks a vendor to service the Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) participating in a Regional Vendor Pilot (hereafter referred to as the Pilot or RVP), conducted as part of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). Specifically, the vendor would be required to accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs; and deliver those foods to those organizations, in good condition, according to a negotiated schedule, and cost effectively. <br /><br />Background</p>
<p>FNS' mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br />Current FDPIR Operational Environment</p>
<p>Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model.</p>
<p>The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.</p>
<p>Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated. <br /><br />Background and Goal of FDPIR Regional Vendor Pilot<br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.</p>
<p>To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.</p>
<p>The Groupings Thirty-one (31) Tribes and/or ITOs expressed interest in participatin. Based on the geographic proximity of those Tribes/ITOs to each other, FNS has identified the following five probable Groupings:</p>
<p>&bull; Midwest Grouping (Grouping #1) is composed of ITOs in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Approximately 5.1 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Southwest Grouping (Grouping #2) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 6.7 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Oklahoma Grouping (Grouping #3) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma. Approximately 4.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 7 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; New Mexico/Arizona Grouping (Grouping #4) is composed of New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 1.8 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The multi-food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 10 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Northwest Grouping (Grouping #5) is composed of ITOs in California, Oregon and Washington. Approximately 3.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 8 different locations. <br /><br />Only one of the Groupings will be selected to participate in the Pilot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Herbicide Applications: Contractor shall furnish all materials, herbicides, equipment, labor, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to safely apply herbicides using aerial spraying apparatus (Helicopter) in accordance with the contract specifications, terms, conditions specified on the herbicide label(s), and State of Montana regulations. This includes fuel, fuel truck, and driver; water for mixing; and any other supplies necessary unless the contract states they will be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be performed by the Contractor include: a) review of treatment plan and specific prescription; b) acquisition of herbicides; c) mobilization; d) application or treatment of the target species with an approved herbicide; e) mix and clean-up of herbicides; f) documentation including a Quality Control Plan (includes safety and spill plans); g) Contractor Quality Inspection Records, h) completing Daily Herbicide Application Record (enclosed in this package), and (i) provide the government a map displaying GPS lines of what was sprayed on each swath.</p>
<p>C.2 Description of Work</p>
<p>The areas scheduled for aerial herbicide treatment on the Helena and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests consist of both linear features (such as roads) and polygons (such as rangelands, big game winter ranges, burned areas and general forest areas) on all three ranger districts of the Helena National Forest (Townsend, Helena, and Lincoln) and all seven ranger districts of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest( Pintler, Butte, Jefferson, Madison, Dillon, Wisdom, Wise River). The topography varies from open rolling hills to steep, high elevation mountain sides. Overstory canopy varies and there may be areas with too dense of forest canopy to aerially spray within the polygons to be treated. All the roads and polygons may have live streams running in or adjacent to them. Closed timber overstory areas and live water are not to be sprayed. Sensitive areas, such as, plants and/or water will have 300 foot buffers around these sensitive sites. The Helena National Forest will establish drift transects around sensitive areas to monitor the application to determine if these 300 foot buffers can be reduced to 100 foot buffers.</p>
<p>Mix and loading sites will be identified and discussed with the Contractor prior to treatment date and will be accessible by road. The Contractor will receive authorization to drive mix and support vehicles behind gated forest roads as needed. The Contractor may be asked to time treatment to avoid conflicts with other users in particular treatment areas (e.g. periods of high public recreation), or to stop treatment if people are found to have somehow entered the treatment area during treatment. Based on experience, such treatment stoppage is anticipated to be the exception and not the rule, but can happen.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall apply the herbicides at as low an elevation as possible subject to vegetation, terrain and safety considerations. Herbicide amounts per acre shall be applied in a water / herbicide mixture at rate of 2 gallons per acre unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Make, model, and type of aircraft offered. If multiple aircraft are offered, a separate price schedule can be provided for each type of aircraft.&bull; Copies of any Forest Service issued aircraft and pilot cards for equipment and operator that will perform work under this contract.&bull; Type of air-to-ground communication equipment.&bull; Aerial Spray Navigation System offered, include capabilities of the equipment.&bull; Other accessories or application methods that are available and may be used for this contract. The Government is particularly interested in practices or equipment to minimize drift.&bull; Copy of Montana Pesticide Applicators License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A Complete Solicitation Package Will Be Available By June 8, 2012.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for continued services to support the NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA). The SEMAA project is designed to increase the participation and retention of historically underserved and underrepresented K-12 youth in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The required services include NASA SEMAA Office (NSO) operation, Monitoring of NASA SEMAA sites and sessions, NASA SEMAA site activity coordination, Aerospace Education Lab (AEL) installation, monitoring, and storage, and creating, producing, and distributing SEMAA evaluation and reports. SEMAA currently operates at 15 sites located in 14 states across the nation. The current SEMAA contract was set to expire on January 21, 2012; a six (6) month extension was exercised under the authority of FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, extending the period of performance to July 23, 2012, due to GRC educational program restructuring. NASA/GRC is currently reviewing its education portfolio. As a result of this, the SEMAA project is currently being restructured; and it has yet to be determined which aspects of the project will remain. It has been determined that until a final decision is rendered regarding the future of each project, day to day operations are to continue. NASA Glenn Research Center recently received instruction for the continuity of the SEMAA operations and enhancements; which is very promising that the program will remain. However, it is necessary for SEMAA to continue beyond the contract end date of July 23, 2012, as final determinations are made. It is the intent of the Government to incorporate the SEMAA program into the Glenn Educational Support Services(ES2) Procurement. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the services from Paragon TEC, Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Paragon TEC, Inc. represents the only responsible source because of its unique combination of qualifications and experience, its understanding of NASA educational goals and objectives, and for being the only source with the wealth of essential experience and combined capabilities to complete the effort within the required period of performance. The company has served as the National SEMAA Office (NSO); and has had oversight of the SEMAA sites with overall responsibility for the day-to-day operations. This requirement will be awarded via a modification to contract NNC07CB33C with Paragon TEC pursuant to the FAR 1.403 entitled, Individual Deviations.	Authority is being requested to deviate from FAR 17.204(e) which limits the term of service contracts to five (5) years including the basic contract and all options. The extended contract period of performance shall not exceed eight months and will be extended by a four-month base extension period with four one-month options. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 PM local time on June 1, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a full and open competition basis.

<SUBJECT>Vessel Charter for Swordfish and Highly Migratory Species Research Cruise
<SOLNBR>AB133F-12-RP-0106
<CONTACT>Mimi Antonio Hetzel, Contract Specialist, Phone 206-526-6032, Fax 206-527-0711, Email Mimi.A.Hetzel@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) is planning a research cruise in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off of the coast of California for highly migratory species including swordfish and albacore during the fall of 2012. The overall goals of the survey are: 1) to conduct longline fishing for swordfish deep during the day to document catch depth, deploy electronic tags to characterize essential habitat and collect biological samples to examine feeding habits and the potential for stock heterogeneity of swordfish entering the U.S. west coast fisheries; 2) to conduct trolling for albacore for the deployment of archival tags and to collect biological samples to examine age and maturity, feeding habits, and the potential for stock heterogeneity of North Pacific albacore entering the U.S. west coast fisheries; 3) to collect oceanographic data to examine environmental effects on the distribution and catch rates swordfish, albacore and any other fish caught; and 4) tag and release healthy Highly Migratory Species (HMS) other than swordfish including sharks and opah caught during longline operations and collect biological samples from mortalities. These objectives will help SWFSC researchers address some of the goals prioritized by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC), the Swordfish Leatherback Use of Temperate Habitat (SLUTH) Initiative and the SWFSC/Albacore Industry Cooperative Research program and provide a better understanding of the California Current ecosystem.
<p>Swordfish longlining: <br />Commercial swordfish fisheries are the second most important fisheries for HMS off the U.S. West Coast. To achieve the objectives listed above, swordfish will be targeted deep during the day at depths of 200 m or greater. Two types of electronic tags will be used: (1) Pop-up satellite tags log data while on the fish and then after a programmed period of time, the tags release, float to the surface and download their data to satellite. These tags need not be recovered to obtain the data. (2) Archival tags do need to be recovered but typically provide much longer and more detailed records than satellite tags providing better information on large-scale movements and behaviors. The information on swordfish behaviors and essential habitat will improve efforts to differentiate swordfish and leatherback turtle habitat which could be used to help fishers target swordfish while avoiding endangered turtles. Biological sampling and electronic tagging data will help to resolve questions of stock structure. The designated sampling area is thought to be one of mixing between swordfish originating from Hawaii and Mexico. Combining data on large-scale movements with studies using isotopes from muscle tissue and otoliths micro-chemistry will improve our understanding of local population dynamics and stock structure. In addition, samples will be used to examine feeding habits, maturity, age and growth, and their ability to tolerate hypoxia, which will provide insight into potential limits to vertical movements.</p>
<p>Albacore trolling:<br />The U.S. North Pacific albacore surface fishery is one of the few remaining open access fisheries for HMS on the West Coast. The North Pacific-wide stock is managed domestically as well as by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). There remain uncertainties about both the age and growth model of albacore and stock structure assumptions used in assessments. These uncertainties can influence biomass and fishing mortality estimates and consequently stock assessments. The SWFSC has been actively studying albacore in cooperation with both the west coast recreational and commercial fleets; however, access to whole fish for tagging and biological sampling is limited to areas targeted by these fleets. Albacore will be targeted throughout the sampling area using several different fishing methods including rod and reel, handline, and troll, supplemented by chumming with live bait. Subsamples of fish will be provided for use by other scientists of the ISC Albacore working group (ALBWG) as identified under the ALBWG research priorities as well as within the SWFSC for age and growth, feeding habits, otolith microchemistry, and genetics studies.</p>
<p>Tagging and sampling of non-target species: <br />While swordfish and albacore are the targets of this research, there are numerous other HMS that will likely be encountered during fishing operations. The SWFSC has ongoing research projects on opah, sharks and other tunas. Sharks and opah caught in good condition will be tagged with satellite tags or conventional spaghetti tags to document stock structure and essential habitat. For tagging it is necessary to bring sharks onto the deck using a large cradle attached to a winch. Opah can be tagged over the side with a long tagging pole. All fish not in condition for release will be taken for biological samples in support of ongoing biological studies.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES:<br />1) Target albacore and swordfish off CA for biological and oceanographic studies.<br />2) Tag and release healthy albacore with archival tags.<br />3) Tag and release healthy swordfish with satellite and archival tags. <br />4) Collect biological samples from up to 30 albacore, opportunistically from swordfish and other fish caught including otoliths, fin spines, scales, gonads, muscle, heart, reproductive tissue, stomach contents, and whole specimens. <br />5) Conduct oceanographic measurements in the fishing areas using CTD deployments and by monitoring acoustic backscatter.<br />6) Document all animals captured and determine species, sex and size distribution by area. <br />7) Tag and release healthy sharks and opah caught during longline fishing operations with conventional and satellite tags for studies of migration and essential habitat.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />Duration: Ten (10) consecutive days minimum to complete operational work. In addition, up to ten (10) optional consecutive days may be contracted pending available funds. The first survey will start approximately September 17; start date will be finalized at time of award. In addition, two option years of ten (10) consecutive days are contemplated, each with up to ten (10) additional optional charter days.</p>

Is your system capable to use existing forms, form migration purposes (what formats)?<br />9. Does your system accommodate blind and visually impaired users? Explain. <br />10. Does your system use any wizards? Explain. <br />11. Does your system allow for a method to pre-populate a form with personal or business data? <br />12. Does your system have a mobile applications capability? Explain how it works. <br />13. How does your system adhere to standards? Is it dependent upon proprietary transmission formats? Explain. <br />14. Is your system capable of migrating forms to a cloud based service (any e-format or paper)?<br />15. Explain your hosting capabilities.</p>
<p>4.0 Format for Response<br />Please limit your response to the questions to no more than one page for each question. The total number of pages should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not exceed 15 pages</span></strong>.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE:<br /><br />
<p>The General Services Administration, Region 2, Public Buildings Service, is seeking to modernize eight elevators (two freight and six passenger elevators) at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House located at One Bowling Green, New York, NY 10004. &nbsp;These elevators are experiencing more frequent failures of the control and drive systems and have required more intensive equipment servicing. &nbsp;In addition, there have been an increasing number of entrapments and passenger complaints regarding these elevators. &nbsp;The modernization of these elevators will improve the safety, reliability, performance, and ride quality for the building's tenants and visitors. &nbsp;Another goal of this modernization effort is to improve the elevator system's energy efficiency.</p>
<p><br />The Government will utilize two-phase design-build selection procedures in accordance with FAR 36.3 for this acquisition. &nbsp;The offerors selected to participate in Phase 2 of the acquisition will be requested to provide a design concept for the modernization, and to the maximum extent practicable, incorporate non-proprietary equipment and controls. &nbsp;This will ensure that when the Government subsequently contracts for elevator maintenance services for the modernized elevators, there will be adequate competition.</p>

<DESC>The proposed acquisition is a total small business set-aside. Offers from other than small business concerns will not be considered. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 541690 with a Small Business Size Standard of $14 million dollars in average annual receipts as determined by 13 CFR 121.104.<br><br>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is issuing a solicitation W912EF-12-R-0013 for commercial Advisory and Assistance Service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.6 for Applied Biostatistical Services for the Northwestern Region's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program. <br><br>The Northwestern Region's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP) conducts scientific investigations to aid in the recovery of listed endangered salmon and other species.  This is accomplished through improving fish passage conditions in the Columbia and Snake Rivers to maximize the survival of juveniles and the return of spawning adults.  The AFEP requires the services of a qualified bio-statistician to provide applied bio-statistical expertise for various research projects under the AFEP, the Corps' comprehensive research program encompassing all the Walla Walla and Portland District's anadromous fish research efforts.  Professional services of biometrician(s)/statistician(s) with demonstrated experience in reviewing anadromous fish research and hydropower operations are necessary to provide an objective and independent review of statistical objectives and parameters of similar research projects.<br><br>     The objectives of the review requirements are to provide statistical review (hereafter referred to as review) of preliminary and final research proposals and draft reports submitted under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Northwestern Region's AFEP.  The statistical review shall evaluate technical merit, applicability, and make recommendations to improve statistical design and analysis.  In addition, the biometrician(s)/statistician(s) will be expected to attend some Corps in-house and AFEP meetings to discuss results, reviews, and to provide comments and suggestions on experimental design during the development and implementation of research studies and assist in the interpretation of results.

Pre-Solicitation (Request for Architect - Engineer Qualifications)
VA101-12-R-0099, Seismic Retrofit/Renovation, VA Portland Medical Center, Oregon

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firm (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of newly constructed and renovated hospitals, large outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, health care and biomedical research, and similarly complex healthcare projects.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firm must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and surveying, seismic design for new and existing buildings.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators. All members should have experience in the planning and design of new hospitals (incorporating the Planetree Patient-Centered Care model), large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, medical research facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects.

Scope:
This project proposes seismic retrofits on the Portland VAMC's two main campus buildings (Building 100 and Building 101).  Building 100 is 680,392 gross square feet (GSF) and Building 101 is 129,692 GSF.  The proposed renovations will mitigate deterioration and failure of the buildings' tile faade and bring them up to current seismic code.  During the seismic retrofit, all in-patient, outpatient, ancillary, administrative and research services housed in Buildings 100 and 101 will be impacted.  To provide essential swing space while the seismic retrofits of the main hospital buildings are in progress, the project also entails demolition of an aging 25,349 GSF "Butler Building" on the campus and the construction of a 265,000 GSF Specialty Care Building in its place.

To accommodate anticipated growth in staff and to address the existing critical employee parking shortage at the Portland VAMC, 600 above ground parking garage spaces will be constructed.

The project will require a comprehensive facility site plan and space plan.  The project will also require an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (as appropriate), a historic preservation (A-106) task, mitigation work, possible community outreach and public meetings, and security analysis.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Renovation of interior areas to include space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, water reduction,  energy efficiency and low energy building  design; additionally, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manuals.  The project will be required to attain a minimum LEED Silver certification.  Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems, etc. will meet current codes and standards. All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities. The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas. Required services will include preparation of equipment and furniture plans and schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.  

The estimated price range for construction project is more than $100,000,000.00. At this time it is anticipated that the Seismic Retrofit of Buildings 100 and 101, New Specialty Care Building, Parking Garage, Energy Plant Expansion, Infrastructure Improvements and Site Work design could follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the users' and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.  The base contract for design will include pre-design, schematic documents and design development documents, with the option to exercise for construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the requisite Project Management Plan and Risk Analysis.  Cost and scope management capabilities will also be examined.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation per the VA BIM Guide.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  The design for all parts of this project are required to meet all national, state, and local building codes, regulations, and standards as well as all VA design guides and design requirements.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/.  Where conflicts occur between VA standards and model codes, the most stringent requirement shall govern.

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  A market study to include Project Labor Agreements and an estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The phases include Pre-Design, Schematic Design 1, Schematic Design 2, Design Development 1, Design Development 2, and Construction Documents.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction at time of award (ECCA).  More design submission requirements can be found in VA Guide PG-18-15.

To be considered, the prime A/E firm must have an established working office within two hundred (200) mile radius of the project site, Portland VA Medical Center, 3710 SW US Veterans Rd, Portland, Oregon 97239; be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work; and be licensed and insured to work in the State of Oregon.

	Fails to meet stated requirements and/or contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies which indicate a lack of understanding of the requirements or an offer which cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk.  These conditions can not be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.


Past Performance:  The VA will assign an adjectival rating based on the information provided by the references and any other source.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and will receive a neutral rating.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  The Evaluation Team may consider past performance data from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the Federal Government.  The Government evaluation team will conduct an evaluation based on past performance of offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements, and the Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in fulfilling the solicitation's requirements.

Outstanding	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were highly effective.  
Excellent	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded some requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were effective.
Acceptable	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements.  The contractual performance contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were satisfactory.
Marginal	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements.  Performance indicated that there are some potential risks associated with the quality of work, timeliness of service, and contract performance.  
Unacceptable	Performance did not meet contractual requirements.  The contractual performance reflected a serious problem for which the offeror has yet to identify corrective actions or the offeror's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.
Neutral	No record of relevant present or past performance, or present and past performance information is not available.
Small Business Participation - This factor shall be evaluated on the basis of whether offeror qualifies as a small or large business.

a) Small Business:  A proposal from an offeror that is a small business shall be evaluated on the following, listed in decreasing order of importance with the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business receiving the maximum score.
i)	Offeror is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.
ii)	Offeror is a Veteran Owned Small Business.
iii)	Offeror is a Small Business, regardless of category.
b) Large Business:  A proposal from an offeror that is a large business shall be evaluated on the following three subfactors, which are equal in importance.  
i) Offeror is a large business that includes one or more small businesses as part of a teaming arrangement.  Offeror's proposal will be evaluated on the degree to which the teaming arrangement includes the following, listed in decreasing order of importance.
(a) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.
(b) Veteran Owned Small Business.
(c) Small Business, regardless of category.
ii) Subcontracting Plan - Offeror's proposal shall be evaluated on the degree to which offeror's subcontracting plan exceeds the goal set forth in the specifications, and includes the following categories, listed in decreasing order of importance:
(a) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.
(b) Veteran Owned Small Business.
(c) Small Business, regardless of category.

The attached "A/E Interview Form" will be used, which includes the following seven factors listed below.  The VA will conduct individual and consensus interview evaluations.  After the interviews, the Evaluation Board will evaluate the Consensus SF330 Rating and the Consensus Interview Rating to determine the Final Evaluation Rating in selecting the top three firms for negotiation.

<DESC>FOR ALL INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Ari Herman 443-395-4773 ari.c.herman@mail.mil<br><br>The Government is looking to both gain a better understanding of potential sources to produce Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U, and to better explain to potential sources what the Government's requirements are for the aforementioned Power Supplies. <br><br>***Note: This Sources Sought is a continuation of the efforts from MARKET-SURVRY-5110-9, originally posted on June 16, 2011 and Pre-solicitation W15P7T-12-R-A307 originally posted May 15, 2012*** <br><br>Background Information: <br><br>The PP-6224D/U is a 'Major Item' which means it is allotted to Soldiers on their Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE). Procurement of these Power Supplies will be used to fill MTOE defined requirements throughout the Army.<br><br>The PP-2953E/U is a 'Secondary Item' which means Soldiers provide funded requisitions to CECOM LCMC to fill their needs. Procurement of these Power Supplies will be to fill field demands.<br><br>Both Tactical Power Supplies share the same performance characteristics and interfaces with their differences being in their associated cabling and their information labels. It is expected that both Power Supplies will share the same production facilities, processes, and components. Both Tactical Power Supplies are considered universal or not tied to any particular system. One of the most common systems for which they are used to support are the vehicular configurations of Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) when used in static locations.<br><br>Technical requirements for these Power Supplies have evolved over the years to incorporate lessons learned, emerging requirements, and to keep current with technological advances. Revision D of MIL-PRF-49080 contains all of the latest requirements information. Some, but not all, of these requirements were incorporated to the current versions of these Power Supplies. W15P7T-12-R-A307 will not be a follow-on contract; previous contract W15P7T-04-D-C021 was for similar items and was awarded to Custom Manufacturing and Engineering, Inc., in September 2004 as a five year, firm-fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity that was extended an additional two years with a Justification and Approval for a sole source award in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The ordering period from this former contract ended October 2011.<br><br>After reviewing the selected NAICS, it was determined that this effort is appropriately defined by NAICS 335999. <br><br>The Government is to determine a Small Business is capable of performing this effort. Small Businesses having a NAICS of 335999 are asked to answer the following questions:<br><br>1)	If your company is awarded the contract, will you be able to perform at least 50% of the work required in house?<br>2)	Can your company go without payment for 90 days?<br><br>Please respond in writing by June 1st 2012 by emailing Ari Herman at ari.c.herman.civ@mail.mil<br><br>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This market survey is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to the market survey.

The ACC-APG is conducting market research to identify possible sources to (1) update existing AN/TPQ-53 Radar Operator Course materials; (2) develop the AN/TPQ-53 Radar Repairer Course; and (3) develop a CBT with IMI for use in support of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar Repairer Course.  <br><br>This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal.  This sources sought announcement serves as a request for information (RFI) in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.<br><br>The AN/TPQ-53 radar is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from rocket, artillery and mortar systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps and will ultimately replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radars; fully supporting brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 radar will interoperate with future battle command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility. The AN/TPQ-53 radar will be capable of being deployed as part of the indirect fire protection capability system of systems to provide a sense and warn capability for fixed and semi-fixed sites.  The AN/TPQ-53 radar will provide a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating rocket, artillery and mortar firing positions. <br><br>The AN/TPQ-53 radar was designed, developed and is currently being produced by Lockheed Martin (Liverpool, NY).  The government does not possess a technical data package for the radar at this time.<br><br>The Army is contemplating a cost plus fixed fee contract for course materials for the AN/TPQ-53 radar.  <br><br>The contractor shall update the existing AN/TPQ-53 Radar Operator Course used in the training of U.S. Army Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 13R, radar operator.  <br><br>The contractor shall also produce and deliver an AN/TPQ-53 Radar Repairer Course that supports the training of U.S. Army MOS 94M radar repairer technicians, on maintenance tasks unique to the AN/TPQ-53 radar.  The course shall train students to conduct field repair and sustainment repairs below depot level and will facilitate transition from contractor to organic support.  <br><br>Both the AN/TPQ-53 Radar Operator Course and the AN/TPQ-53 Radar Repairer Course will use the system configuration baseline, in both the armored and unarmored prime mover and Cobham and TriQuint transmit/receive (T/R) module configurations. <br><br>The contractor shall also produce and deliver CBT with IMI to support the AN/TPQ-53 Radar Repairer Course. This software solution will allow virtual training of all AN/TPQ-53 radar repair tasks from a desktop or laptop computer.  The CBT with IMI will have a web-based military handbook (MIL-HDBK)-29612-3A Level III IMI media package to accompany the corresponding lesson plans. Courseware shall be able to run on the Army Learning Management System (ALMS). The CBT shall use commercial off the shelf hardware and Microsoft Windows operating system.  The product will accurately and completely simulate the radar repairer's man-machine interface with the AN/TPQ-53 radar.  <br><br>Software must be compatible and operate on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, release 4.9 operating system with kernel-2.6.9-101.EL and later.  Software must be able to run on a MILTOPE RLC-3G rugged laptop computer with an Intel  Core  2 Duo T9400 2.53Ghz mobile processor, GM45 architecture, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and an ATI e4690 Discrete Graphics Solution with 512MB dedicated memory.<br><br>Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.

<a href="mailto:Mario.Perez@nasa.gov">Dr. Mario R Perez</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), through the Astrophysics Division and its Cosmic Origins (COR) Program, is soliciting information through this Request for Information (RFI) pertaining to potential ultraviolet (UV) and visible wavelength astrophysics science investigations.  Specifically, NASA seeks information that can be used to develop a cohesive set of science goals that motivate and support the development of the next generation of UV/Visible space astrophysics missions. Information may include broad science goals, justifications for investigations that support COR science goals (for examples, visit http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/    ), specific measurements or proxy observing plans for well-defined astrophysical experiments, or any aspect of scientific inquiry in the UV/Visible that supports the above COR goals. This is a Request for Information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA nor the U.S. Government will be responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. Background Answering the question How did we get here? is one of the key goals in NASAs Astrophysics Division and is the prime objective of the COR Program.  Some of the questions included in the broad study of our cosmic origins include: 	When did the first stars in the universe form, and how did they influence their environments? 	How did dark matterwhich is pervasive, mysterious, and poorly understoodclump up in these very early times, pulling gas along with it into dense concentrations that eventually became galaxies? 	How did galaxies evolve from the very first systems to the types we observe in the local universe such our own Milky Way galaxy? 	When did supermassive black holes form in the early universe, and how have they affected the evolution of the galaxies in which they are found? 	What are the mechanisms by which stars and their planetary systems form? 	How are the chemical elements distributed in galaxies and dispersed in the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium? 	How does baryonic matter flow from the intergalactic medium to galaxies and ultimately into planets? No single space or airborne observatory can provide all the answers.  The COR Program includes telescopesboth present and futurethat together operate across a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the far-UV through meter-wavelength radio.	 This RFI is limited to observing capabilities in the near-UV and visible parts of the spectrum, as recommended by the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, in its report New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics (NWNH), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951	   .    The science topics above may ultimately be addressed in part with an UV/Visible telescope that will continue the important work accomplished with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Deep, high-resolution imaging in the near-UV and visible parts of the spectrum is a touchstone for astronomical research.  Such imaging, over a much larger area of the sky than has been possible with HST, has the capacity to expand our knowledge of the universe in a revolutionary manner.  UV spectroscopy is likely to be a key component in advancing COR science because high-resolution UV spectroscopy is essential for detecting gas in plasmas and probing low-density inflows and outflows of matter and energy that profoundly affect galaxy evolution. In the previous decade, many concepts of a UV/Visible mission that might operate in the post-HST environment were studied at various levels of detail.	These studies considered a wide assortment of science cases and required mission concepts with a wide range of basic parameters, such as aperture size and wavelength coverage.  Although NWNH recommended a 4-meter-diameter aperture, the expected implementation of a UV/Visible mission is far enough in the future that specifying a particular mission configuration is premature until a well-defined, suitably detailed, and appropriately derived set of science requirements is first developed.  The fundamental mission parameters will be derived only after the set of science requirements is defined.	This RFI is intended to initiate the process of defining those requirements by delineating the science investigations such a mission might ultimately fulfill. Requested Information The COR Program seeks to build a broad-based, community-derived set of science requirements for the next generation UV/Visible space astrophysics mission(s).	This RFI solicits input from any interested party or parties who wish to contribute scientific questions of interest that can be addressed with not-yet-specified future UV/Visible mission(s).  Future possible mission concepts and pursuant technology investments will be defined using the results of this RFI.	 Potential respondents are strongly encouraged to submit science investigations that are unconstrained by specifications of prior mission concepts. The requested information must touch on COR science goals, but could span the gamut from broad, well-justified science questions to specific observing plans for narrowly defined astrophysical experiments.  A broad response might consist of a top-level science question with a thorough explanation of its compelling appeal.	A specific plan could detail how a particular question in astrophysics is addressed with a selected set of observables at a specified level of sensitivity, wavelength range, spatial or spectral resolution, time resolution, field of view, target numbers, etc.  In between these two extremes, a range of definitive explanations of scientific investigations that pursue COR science goals is solicited. In order to provide suitable guidance for a mission in the far future, it is implicit in this RFI that respondents attempt to imagine compelling scientific investigations in an era well beyond the present.  The goal of this RFI is to synthesize a wide range of far-reaching ideas into a coherent vision, thereby fostering tangible progress in the near future. Respondents should submit the requested information in the format most effective for conveying that information (e.g., white paper, presentation charts, technical paper, other).  Submissions should contain, at a minimum, the following information: 	Name of submitter and contact information, including all team members, institutional affiliations, and E-mail addresses.  Note that a lead submitter or point-of-contact must be identified (name and position, organization, E-mail, phone number); 	A description of how the science addresses the top-level COR science objectives (briefly). 	A description of the science investigation, including a justification for its compelling nature.  The description can be as general or detailed as the respondent desires. 	An indication of your willingness to participate and present your science objectives and investigations at a workshop, if invited. Future Plans Shortly after the release of this RFI, NASA plans to coordinate with existing Science Analysis Group (SAG) within the Cosmic Origins Program Analysis Group (COPAG: http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/copag/    ).  This group will work with the astrophysics community and the COR Program Office to review the diverse set of RFI responses and to define coherent sets of science objectives and requirements for mission concepts. As a part of the science definition process, NASA will sponsor a workshop in September 2012.  Information regarding the workshop will be updated online at: http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/RFI2012     as the arrangements are solidified. At the workshop, NASA will present: a)	The broader context for NASAs effort to engage the widest possible community for science definition, b)	A summary of the information received in response to this RFI, c)	The plan for realizing a synthesized, prioritized set of science objectives and requirements, and how they will be used for developing next UV/Visible mission concept(s). All responders to this RFI, as well as the broader community, are encouraged to attend the workshop and participate in this process.  The workshop will serve as a forum for discussing community input and for mapping those contributions into relevant science objectives.  The SAG and the COR Program Office will use the RFI responses and the deliberations of the workshop to synthesize the varied science investigations and to further define and prioritize science objectives and requirements.  The final product of this effort will be a document that defines the resulting science objectives.  These science objectives will provide a basis for developing and refining future UV/Visible mission concepts and pursuant technology investments.  The current mission concept development plan includes both Medium- and Large-class missions.  The science objectives will be assessed for appropriate mission class for concept development. Following the closure of this RFI (#1) process and workshop, NASA intends to issue another RFI (#2) for the purpose of soliciting mission concepts, instrument concepts, and constitutive technologies that will satisfy some or all of the science objectives defined via the previous RFI #1 process.  Disclaimer It is NASAs intent to disclose publicly information obtained through this RFI and to incorporate relevant portions into the workshop proceedings and the final requirements document.  Responders shall not submit proprietary information, export controlled information (including ITAR restricted information), or confidential information in response to this RFI.  It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, or Invitation for Bid.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3 titled, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the U.S. Government pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

INTRODUCTION: 

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is conducting a market survey and is seeking potential sources for the construction of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant at the Manchester VA Medical Center (VAMC). 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Energy development analysis of VAMC Manchester, NH indicates that a CHP Plant installation will result in reduced overall operating costs and Green House Gases to VA when all factors are accounted for including: energy costs, maintenance, operation and future capital expenditures. To that end, VAMC Manchester is proceeding with the design of a CHP Plant to supplement existing Boiler Plant assets.  

The CHP Plant will consist of one Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engine (RICE) natural gas generator (approximately 650 kWe) with heat recovery and generator controls; power metering, data acquisition, computer control equipment; power utility interconnection equipment, including but not limited to: transformers, switchgear, and protective relays; computer control software; and associated ancillary materials and equipment, site civil work, paving, concrete foundations, building structures and permanent steel platforms, stairs, handrail and ladders.  The RICE generator will be able to supplement the normal power generated for the facility but will not be replacement for the emergency generation capacity for the plant or facility.

The CHP Plant will be located in Building 7, within the same space as the existing Boiler Plant.  The CHP Plant will require removal of abandoned Boiler #2 and relocation of Boiler #3 to make space for construction of a new room to install the RICE generator.  The electric service for Building 7 will be upgraded to support installation of the CHP Plant.  A new underground ductbank will be installed between Building 1 and Building 7 to accommodate electric utility interface requirements.  The existing Building 7 natural gas service will be used as the fuel source for the CHP Plant.

The system will be able to provide operator initiated automatic start-up and shutdown of the electric generating equipment, and will also include provisions for automatic start-up and shutdown based upon other inputs such as utility power interruptions.  The system will be designed for construction and operation in full integration with the existing central steam plant such that no additional boiler plant operating personnel are required for safe operation of the combined plant systems as defined by VA regulations, policy and guidelines.


PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:

The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed-price contract utilizing the design-bid-build approach. The anticipated solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in accordance with FAR Part 14, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the IFB. However, the results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of the procurement method. The type of socio-economic set-aside, in any, will depend upon the responses to this notice and any other information gathered during the market research process. 

This project is planned for advertising in August 2012. In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the magnitude of construction is between $2,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237130 (size standard $33.5 million) applies to this procurement. The duration of the project is estimated at 365 calendar days from the issuance of a Notice to Proceed. The services for this project will include providing all construction related services including: providing labor, materials and equipment required to complete the project as per contract documents prepared by an independent Architect-Engineer firm.

1.0 	BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Field Security Operations, Network Security Operations Center (NSOC) serves as VA's security operations element of under Office of Information Security (OIS).  The NSOC manages, protects, and monitors the cyber and security posture of the Department, coordinates externally with government incident response centers, performs threat and vulnerability analyses, reports cyber security deficiencies, develops concept of operations or guidelines relating to cyber security incidents, performs analyses of cyber security events, maintains detailed logs and databases of VA cyber security incidents and responses, and generally performs the full range of functions across the spectrum of activities relating to incident management and response, vulnerability scanning, event correlation and analysis, audit log analysis, patch distribution, and remediation planning.  

The Local Area Network (LAN) equipment that supports the Hines facility VA-NSOC has not been substantially updated since the opening of the Hines Facility in 2006. The LAN needs upgrades to support new capabilities for both voice and data networking. This technology refresh will enable future projects in areas such as Voice over IP (VoIP).

The Hines Refresh project covers the removal of the entire existing LAN at Hines and the installation and configuration of new LAN equipment. This new LAN equipment has already been procured, and existing network equipment will be retired and returned to the Inventory Control group. The project includes verification that the physical and environmental conditions of the Hines Room 147X data center are adequate for the new LAN. The project also includes documentation of the new LAN and migration of all users at Hines to the new LAN.  

This request is in support of the Hines Refresh project and is required in order to install and re-cable the Hine, IL data center infrastructure.

Justification and Approval
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.   Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, for Portland VA Medical Center.

2.   Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This is a request for a single source award to PR # 648-12-2-069-0789 in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

Urgent and compelling need for Gamunex due to several patients in current therapy requiring the drug within 24 hours in order to continue therapy.  The contract allotment of Gamunex was unavailable as of 7:30am, P.S.T., 2 February 2012 due to the allocation being used up before the facility could place their order.

3.   Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Need s  :
Portland VAMC requires IVIG solution that is sugar free. Several patients are currently in therapy and Pharmacy does not have enough stock to cover all orders after 2/02/12.

Line item 1: Gamunex- C 10%, 10GM, 30 Vials @ xxx/g = $ xxx
Line Item 2: Gamunex-C 10% 5GM, 10 Vials @ xxx /g = $ xxx 

4.   Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is that there is an emergent need with no time for bid.

This product is available as a contract item; however, since NAC has not been able to increase contract supply allocations as yet, a non-contract source had to be acceptable.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications o r Nature of the Acquisition    Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Mckesson has an established distribution network for pharmaceuticals and has the ability to get us this product by the time required. Several patients are in current therapy cycles, so delivery time is critical. 

Gamunex-C is the only IVIG product that is sugar free and has to be used to avoid insulin complications in the recipients.

6.   Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as  Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
In accordance with the orders of priority, contracted product was attempted to be purchased but I was told by the pharmacy prime vendor contractor that no more contract product was available for purchase. 

This is a new process and we are diligently researching additional vendors that can supply this product but due to the emergent need, this order had to be placed today in order to receive product by treatment time.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
 In accordance with FAR 13.106-3 (1) Oral quotes were received by vendors.  Due to the urgent need award was made to McKesson whom was the only vendor who could provide this drug at this time. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
See market research document in file.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
Oregon Pedigree Law prohibits the sale of any pharmaceutical drug from another state into Oregon if the product cannot be tracked to origin.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
Mckesson is a less expensive supplier of Gamunex-C today.  Pricing of blood products vary according to market fluctuations.

 

Approvals IAW VHA SOP 3.22.11: 

Contracting Specialist's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

_____________________________                       ________________________

Acquisition Manager's Review and Approval:  I have reviewed the foregoing justification and find it to be complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and recommend approval for other than full and open competition.

Part 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY Factor 1: Section A: Technical Approach. The Government describes its requirement through the Statement of Work to solicit the expertise of industry to construct an offer it believes will best achieve the performance.  (1) The Technical Approach shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary, but limited to page constraints to fully explain the proposal technical approach. (2) The technical proposal should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work to be performed and include measurable performance standards by which performance will be evaluated for determining whether the offeror performed successfully. (3) The proposal shall include the offeror's understanding of the Bureau of Indian Education's goals for the project and an understanding of the SOW. (4) The technical approach should include, but is not be limited to the following: (a) A description of the processes the offeror routinely uses to provide Counseling services. (b) A description of conditions which can affect achieving the stated performance objectives.

Part 2:  EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, PERSONNEL
Factor 2: Section A: Key Personnel: The contractor shall demonstrate knowledge and experience by submitting resume(s) for key personnel. Key personnel are defined as those individuals the offeror views as essential to successfully performing its proposal technical approach.  The offeror shall provide copies of state issued licenses of key personnel who will be performing Counseling services at BIE - Red Rock Day School, Red Valley, AZ.  Experience/Industry Knowledge: 
Part 3:  PAST PERFORMANCE Factor 3: Section A: The Past Performance narrative shall be in as much detail as the offeror considers necessary to fully explain the proposal past performance. The Government wants assurance past performance demonstrates the selected contractor exemplifies the capability of project execution and completion as described in this SOW. Examples must be recent, having been performed in the last five (5) years. The offeror must describe how its past performance is on a scale similar in size to this requirement. The strength of the offeror's response will be based on the implementation of Counseling services and benefits/achievement(s) of students who have received Counseling services.

Part 4:  PRICE The detail should include sufficient descriptions to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the realism of the offeror's price and to determine the reasonableness of the price submitted.
The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. 
Unrealistically high (or low) pricing in the initial or revised proposal may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition - either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. The Government will review (1) proposed prices to determine whether they are materially balanced; and (2) any unbalanced offer to assess the associated risks to the Government in awarding to such an offeror, and whether award will result in unreasonably high or low price for contract performance. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. The Government will determine each offer's total evaluated price by summing the base year and all option periods in accordance with FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.
The Government, at a minimum, expects a payment schedule that is on a firm fixed price to include hourly rates, daily rates, and preparation rates with number of days, taxes, and travel. Offerors are responsible for complying with the FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 and applying the appropriate Department of Labor prevailing wage rates for labor, if applicable. Other applicable Wage Determination rates may be provided by the Contracting Officer if a written request is submitted to the Contracting Officer 10 days prior to the closing of the RFP. The offeror has public access at http://www.wdol.gov/ to locate the prevailing wage rates for their area.  
4. Proposal Acceptance Period Notwithstanding FAR clause 52.212-1, the proposal acceptance period is 90 days after the date set for receipt of proposals. The Offeror shall make a clear statement in the proposal cover page that the proposal is valid until this period has ended.
5. Proposal Preparation Costs The Government will not be obligated to pay any costs incurred by an offeror in the preparation and submission of a proposal in response to this RFP.
SECTION M - FAR 52.212-02 Evaluation -Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  This is a best value award, and the evaluation criteria for this award is specified below. The Government will use the offeror's proposal as a representation of how the offeror will meet the Government's requirements. The Government will compare the offeror's proposed plans and other areas of the offeror's proposal to evaluate the offeror's overall likelihood to successfully meeting the requirements stated herein.
1.	The Government reserves the right to make award based on initial offers and without discussions. All requirements must be addressed in your proposal, if any are omitted your response may be non-responsive and not evaluated.

An offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a contract or purchase order from the Federal Government pursuant to FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008). 3.

Blue (50 pts)	Outstanding - The response is very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear. Proposal consistently meets the solicitation requirements with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.
Green (30pts)	Excellent - Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.
Orange (15 pts)	Satisfactory - The response generally meets requirements but there is no expectation of better than acceptable performance.  Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without minor revision to the proposal.
Yellow ( 5pts)	Poor - The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revision to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.
Red (0 pts) 	Unsatisfactory - Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In conjunction with FAR 12.6, the government intends to use the policies and procedures in accordance with FAR 15 Contract By Negotiation. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. 2012-N-14321 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This procurement is Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code 541890. The total period of performance under this contract shall be base period of 12 months with two (2) option periods twelve (12) months each. This is a Fixed Price Award Fee contract with not to exceed travel line item. The resultant contract will be funded using Prevention and Public Health Funds (PPHF). Additional PPHF reporting as required per Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clause 352.204-16 is incorporated in full text.<br /><br />The purpose of the National Tobacco Education Campaign is to educate the public about the harmful effects of tobacco use and encourage smokers to quit. Our objectives will be to raise awareness of the health consequences of tobacco use; encourage cessation of tobacco products; and to direct people to free resources to help them quit. This campaign will support and reinforce the messages delivered by state and community media campaigns. The primary target audience for this campaign is the adult smoker ages 18-54. Secondary audiences include adult and young adult non-smokers, parents, family members, and adolescents. Coordinated mass media, public and private sector partnerships, and earned and social media strategies are core elements of the campaign. <br /><br />This is a Performance Base Award. The main purpose of this contract is to conduct a paid national media campaign which will run for three to six months (per performance period). The contractor should describe in its proposal a strategy for implementing a paid national media campaign, recognizing that with limited funds available, an emphasis would need to be placed on leveraging media dollars to the greatest extent possible and considering the best ratio of national to localized placement. Contractors are encouraged to include budgets for the costs of running a 12- vs. 24-week buy (3 vs. 6 month campaign) in all 200+ designated market areas (DMAs). <br />The contractor shall develop up to fifteen (15) ad packages (5 in the Base year, 5 in Option period one and 5 in Option period two) that may target particular underserved populations at high risk for tobacco use. For the purposes of this contract, an ad package refers to the comprehensive development of an ad concept, with at least one execution in these mediums: television, radio, print, out of home, and digital executions.

Attachment 1- Contract Line Items<br />2. Attachment 2- Performance Work Statement <br />3. Attachment 3- Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan<br />4. Attachment 4- Award Fee Plan
<p>Your submission should include three separate proposals: technical, business and past performance. Evaluation of Offeror's proposals shall occur in a two stage process. In Stage One, the offeror's written technical and business proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria listed below. After initial evaluation, and for the purposes of efficiency, the Government may elect to establish a competitive range limited to those Offerors that are the most highly rated, based only on the Offeror's written technical and business proposal.<br /><br />In Stage Two, Offerors in the Competitive Range will be invited to participate in Oral presentations. During this stage the Offeror's Oral Presentation will be evaluated and the scoring thereof added to the Offeror's written proposal (Stage One score) to form the overall rating for the Offeror. Past Performance will be evaluated for all offerors in the Competitive Range on performance documentation or any other pertinent information available to the Government. <br />This contract will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposal is considered to be the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. For purposes of this evaluation, technical factors are more important than price in making the award determination. The Government will not make an award at a higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.<br />Quality Assurance Surveillance and Award Fee Plan<br /><br />The contractor evaluation of this contract will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) per attachment 3, and the award fee will be based on the criteria contained in the Award Fee Plan, attachment 4. The QASP is a Government developed document and the purpose is used to ensure that the Government receives quality services, and pays only for services actually provided. The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish. The QASP includes a Performance Requirement Summary, which will be used to gauge the Contractor's commitment to successful performance, its willingness to stand behind its products and services during the course of the contract, as well as its confidence and ability to perform. The award fee plan sets forth specific criteria and procedures used to evaluate Contractor performance and to determine the amount of award fee earned during the performance of the contract. The Government may modify this award fee plan through unilateral modification at any time.<br />Part I: Technical Proposal: <br />The Contractor shall limit the technical proposal to 50 single-sided pages (not including appendices and exhibits), 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper of 12-point font. Pages exceeding the specified limit will be removed and not forwarded for evaluation. The narrative plan must include a technical approach &amp; plan of operation, staffing &amp; management work plan, proposed deliverables, and key deadline dates. In addition, the Contractor must provide a description of corporate qualifications and past/similar experience to demonstrate the company's ability to successfully complete assignments of comparable size and complexity. <br /><br />Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's statement of work will not be eligible for award. The technical proposal should be in as much detail as considered necessary to reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken.<br />The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., must be contained in the technical proposal so that the Offeror's understanding of the work can be evaluated. For purposes of the requirements set forth under this contract, the evaluation will be based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br />Criteria Value of criteria<br />Similar Experience 40%<br />Technical Approach and Plan of Operation 25%<br />Oral Presentation 20%<br />Staffing and Management Plan 15%<br />Total: 100% <br /><br />Part II: Business Proposal<br />The business proposal shall include the total price for the entire project, and shall be broken down by the task activities as set forth in the performance work statement. Pricing shall be a firm fixed priced, with a not to exceed Travel Line Item, and an Award fee determined by the Government. The price should be included as an appendix in an Excel spreadsheet itemized per task including cost for any subcontracted work. Budgets, staff hours, and other direct costs should be organized around the tasks and related deliverables described in the PWS. Offerors shall propose a payment schedule based on completion of defined milestones or specified deliverables in accordance with the PWS.<br />Part III: Past Performance</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror's past performance as it relates to accomplishing the requirements of the Statement of Work. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. By past performance, the Government means the Offeror's record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance<br />A list of no more than three (3) most current (within the last 5 years), relevant contracts and/or subcontracts (completed or currently in progress) for the prime offeror and any subcontractors (3 each for prime and significant subcontract(s)). Contracts listed may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>(End of Section G)<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>H.1. Communication</p>
<p>Any HRSA communication products developed under this contract will require an additional separate clearance on an HHS-615 (for text and/or graphic publications and products that will be printed, posted on the Web, or disseminated through other electronic methods, such as by email) or an HHS-524A (for audiovisual products, including those that will be posted on the Web). Communication clearance for this contract itself does not satisfy the requirement to seek clearance of the specific HRSA communication products.</p>
<p>H.2. Printing and Duplicating</p>
<p>The printing of government documents must be accomplished through the Government Printing Office (GPO). Contractors and grantees shall not be used as sources of printing for the Department or OPDIVS. Therefore, the inclusion of printing in contracts and grants is prohibited unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP). All requests for waivers must go through the HHS Department Printing Officer. Contractors may prepare copy, illustrative material (forms etc.) and /or camera ready copy for the purpose of producing publications.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing (as the term is defined in Title 1 of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations in effect on the effective date of this contract) in connection with the performance of work under this contract; except that performance of a requirement under this contract involving less than 25,000 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages will not be deemed to be printing. A production unit is defined as one sheet, size 8.5 x 11 inches, one side only, and one color.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of private funds for printing, the regulations state that when appropriated funds are to be used to create information for publication, the printing of that information cannot be made available to a private publisher for publication without prior approval of the congressional Joint Committee on Printing by way of the office of HHS Department Printing Officer. For any questions, please contact the HHS Department Printing Officer at 301-594-3185.</p>
<p>H.3. Clearance/Production of Information Products/services</p>

An external communication product is one that will be distributed outside of HRSA in any quantity. This clearance, which takes approximately 4 weeks, is obtained by the project officer through HRSA's Office of Communications.</p>
<p>It is the policy of HHS that HHS must be prominently and dominantly identified as the primary publisher/producer, to include the name of HHS and placement of the HHS logo, on all communication materials, including those produced for Government publications and Government printed matter by contractors.</p>

All publications and audiovisual products must display the month and year of issuance. The HHS and HRSA logos must be displayed on the front cover of any publications and on the opening and closing frames of any audiovisual products. The requirement for placement of the logos may be satisfied by displaying the HHS logo on the bottom left corner and the HRSA logo on the bottom right corner.

Government publications or other Government printed matter may not include the contractor's logo unless specifically authorized in accordance with agency policy and procedures (http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/webpolicies/logopolicies/logos_contractors.html)</p>
<p>Communication products are any and all products intended for audiences outside the Agency, including but not limited to:<br />&bull; reports, booklets, manuals, fact sheets, newsletters, brochures, flyers<br />&bull; Internet publications<br />&bull; press releases, advisories, other media materials (including press kits)<br />&bull; exhibits, exhibit structures <br />&bull; conferences, meeting materials (including program/agenda books)<br />&bull; summaries, monographs, proceedings<br />&bull; slides, overhead transparencies, posters<br />&bull; audio and videotapes, films, CDs, DVDs, and other audiovisual products<br />&bull; multimedia products, educational or information modules<br />&bull; advertisements and/or scripts for radio, TV, Web, or other venue</p>
<p>Internal publications (no copies will be distributed outside of the Agency in print; electronically by any means, including by email or listserv; and will not be posted on the Internet) are exempted from this requirement. Where appropriate, the words Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau ..., Office of, Division of ..., shall be included above the HRSA logo.</p>
<p>Title 44 of the U.S. Code requires that the printing of any publication developed under this contract shall be done by the Government Printing Office. Printing shall be coordinated through the Contracting Officer Representative.</p>
<p>NOTE: OMB clearance must be obtained if you (the contractor) intend to survey or interview more than 9 people outside of HRSA and/or the Department, including grantees. Failure on the part of the Contractor to comply with the printing and duplicating, and publication clearance requirements stated above will be deemed unauthorized services and reimbursement will be denied.</p>
<p>H.4. Language Disclaimer</p>
<p>The views expressed in written conference materials, publications, audiovisual products, and by speakers and moderators at HHS-sponsored conferences, do not necessarily reflect the official policies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services nor does mention of trade names, commercial practices, or organizations imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.</p>
<p>There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation at http://www.hhs.gov/policies/hhsar/.</p>

<p><br />M.1. General</p>
<p>In order for proposals to be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, they must be prepared in accordance with the instructions given in this RFP. Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's statement of work will not be eligible for an award.</p>
<p>M2. Negotiations</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that the Government may elect to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with the Offeror(s). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>M.3. Selection of Offerors</p>
<p>1. The acceptability or unacceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be based upon an evaluation by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity to the evaluation criteria of the RFP (see Section L and M), utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an Offeror.</p>
<p>2. The Government DOES NOT anticipate multiple awards will result from this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this RFP. In addition, the RFP may be amended if determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>M.4. Award Criteria</p>
<p>The Government will make an award to Offerors whose offer represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. The technical proposal is significantly more important than price in the selection of the Contractor for this acquisition. In the event that the technical evaluation reveals that two or more offers are substantially equal in technical ability, then price will become the determining factor.</p>
<p>M.5. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>M.5.1. <br />a. The merits of the proposal will be evaluated carefully using the following criteria and points as they relate to the content of the corresponding paragraphs of the Technical Proposal Instructions.</p>
<p>b. Note: The following evaluation criteria (A-G), for a total of 100 points, will apply to your technical proposal which will be evaluated by a technical evaluation panel (TEP). In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. If such a circumstance exists, the maximum number of points the offeror may receive for its technical proposal is 95 and the technical proposal will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 95. If such a circumstance exists, all technical proposal scores will be converted to a percentage of the total points possible according to the applicable rating scale. The TEP will recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.</p>
<p>M.5.2. Evaluation Criteria and Assigned Points<br /><br />The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of the proposal will be evaluated carefully. The following criteria are those that will be applied in the evaluation of the technical proposal. The assigned weights for each factor are shown below:</p>
<p>The proposal will be evaluated using the following criteria and weights as they relate to the content of the corresponding paragraphs of the TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p>The Government may award this contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, with paramount consideration being given to the evaluation of the technical proposal rather than cost or price.<br />M.6. Cost Evaluation</p>
<p>Estimated cost is not a numerically weighted factor. Proposed costs will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism, which is defined as the Offeror's ability to project costs which are realistic for the work to be performed and indicates that the Offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed, is consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal, and represents the best value to the Government for the life of the contract.</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />M.7 Evaluation of Option</p>
<p>52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990)</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(End Section M)<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT A</p>
<p>Descriptions/Specifications/Statement of Work</p>
<p><br />I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>In 1999, Congress passed the Healthcare Research and Quality Act, which established the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program. The act was signed on December 6, 1999 and the legislation authorized the program for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2000 and FY 2001. On October 17, 2000, the Children's Health Act of 2000 amended the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 extending the CHGME Payment Program through FY 2005. Additional amendments to Section 340E of the Public Health Service Act affecting the CHGME Payment Program were made under Public Laws 108-490 and 109-307. The FY 2011 CHGME Payment Program appropriation provided GME support to fifty-five (55) children's hospitals in 30 states and territories and the District of Columbia, supporting more than 6,000 resident full-time equivalents (FTEs) training in these hospitals. <br /><br />Within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), day-to-day program administration is managed by the Children Graduate Medical Education Training Branch (CHGMETB) of the Division of Medicine and Dentistry (DMD) in the Bureau of Health Professions with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).</p>
<p>CHGME Payment Program statute, Public Law 109-307, mandates that the "Secretary (i.e., DHHS) shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the [initial] application of the hospital for the current FY for both direct and indirect expense amounts." Therefore, prior to the end of the FY (September 30) for which children's hospitals have applied for CHGME Payment Program funding, the Secretary shall determine [reconcile] any changes to the resident FTE counts reported by a hospital in its initial application for the current FY, which will impact final payments made by the CHGME Payment Program to all eligible children's hospitals. Additional information on the CHGME Payment Program, including funding eligibility, application processes and forms, data sources, and deadlines can be found within the CHGME Payment Program application guidance provided within the program website, at http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/childrenshospitalgme/pdf/chgmefy10applicationguidance.pdf.</p>
<p>In 2003, the CHGME Payment Program through the Federal acquisition process, awarded a contract to develop and implement a comprehensive methodology and protocol for assessing the resident FTE counts reported by children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program - the Resident FTE Assessment Program. The Resident FTE Assessment Program is designed to assess the resident FTE counts reported by all children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program irrespective of the type(s) of Medicare cost reports (MCRs) the hospitals' filed while assuring timely, consistent attention to the resolution of discrepancies for all participating children's hospitals and the maintenance of one unified system to account for the assessment of resident FTE counts for Medicare and CHGME Payment Program purposes. The current contract expires on September 30, 2012.</p>
<p><br /><br />II. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The overall objective of this contract is to audit the unweighted and weighted resident FTE counts reported by children's hospitals in their initial applications for CHGME Payment Program funding as required under Public Law 109-307. The offeror shall complete the Resident FTE Assessment Program within a six-month period to allow the CHGME Payment Program to reconcile payments within the FY for which payments are being made. For FY 2013, the Resident FTE Assessment Program shall commence on October 1, 2012 and conclude no later than March 15, 2013. Each successive contract year has similar commencement and completion dates.</p>
<p>This time frame significantly differs from the Medicare program, which provides for the resolution of data, including resident FTE counts, for a given MCR period to occur over several years following the hospital's filing of the subject MCR. Unlike the Medicare program, any changes to data, including resident FTE counts, reported by children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program affects the distribution of funding among all children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program. In addition, only thirty-eight (38) of the children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program filed full MCRs (i.e., report residents to Medicare on Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) 2552-96, Worksheet E-3, Part IV and Part VI), twelve (12) filed low- or no-utilization MCRs for all applicable years, and the remaining five (5) filed a combination of full and low- or no-utilization MCRs for all applicable years. Hence, it is imperative that inconsistencies and/or discrepancies related to resident FTE counts be resolved within this six-month period to allow for adjustment of CHGME Payment Program payments prior to the end of the FY.</p>
<p>The CHGME Payment Program is statutorily tied to Section 1886 of the Social Security Act (SSA) as implemented by regulations at 42 CFR 413.75 through 413.83 and all CMS-related and CHGME Payment Program -specific rules and regulations regarding the determination of resident FTE counts for DME and IME payment purposes, except where otherwise noted. For this reason, children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program are expected to maintain, and be able to provide immediately upon request, documentation consistent with 42 CFR 413.75(d) in support of the resident FTE counts reflected in their initial applications for CHGME Payment Program funding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in accordance with Section 1886 of the SSA, the offeror shall assess the resident FTE counts and additional supporting documentation provided by the CHGME Payment Program and/or participating children's hospitals for all relevant MCR periods. To accomplish this, the offeror shall establish a methodology which utilizes the general methodology designed and implemented by CMS for auditing resident FTE counts claimed for Medicare payments, build upon work and data previously developed for Medicare and CHGME Payment Program purposes and have an established protocol to assure the coordination of effort and sharing of data between the CHGME Payment Program and Medicare programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offeror shall develop a comprehensive proposal that shall include a detailed description of the methodology and tools to be used to address the scope of the reviews, including activities, a staffing proposal and a timeframe for accomplishing the activities. The contractor shall maximize use of assessment tools that have been previously developed, are applicable for this scope of work, and/or can be adapted to the requirements of the CHGME Payment Program.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal shall include the above-mentioned program objectives and the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. incorporate the general methodology designed and implemented by CMS for auditing resident FTE counts claimed for Medicare payments;<br />2. apply the requirements as set forth in Section 1886 of the SSA as implemented at 42 CFR 413.75 through 413.83 to the review of documentation related to and the determination of resident FTEs assessed under the Resident FTE Assessment Program;<br />3. include flow charts demonstrating the contractor's understanding of and ability to execute the Resident FTE Assessment Program based on the contents of this RFC including how it will assess and handle the various types of MCRs filed by participating children's hospitals (i.e., full, low- or no-utilizations MCRs);<br />4. distinguish between children's hospitals that file full MCRs and those that file low- or no-utilization MCRs for purposes of minimizing duplication of efforts with respect to the assessment of FTE resident counts and minimizing public burden;<br />5. describe as separate processes the three types (or levels) of review and the tools to be used to perform the reviews (described below);<br />6. include a description of the processes to be followed, the activities to be performed, the timing of each activity, the notification and the resolution processes, the software to be used, and the sample work papers and reports to be completed after each review;<br />7. identify potential documentation requests (including source(s) and reasons);<br />8. obtain and build upon the work papers from prior Medicare audits and/or CHGME Payment Program assessments, where applicable, and include a protocol for the coordination of effort and sharing of data between the CHGME Payment Program and Medicare programs;<br />9. communicate and work closely with their Medicare counterparts to ensure that their findings are incorporated into the Medicare process, where applicable;<br />10. clearly delineate the type, the format and the content of reports that will be submitted to the contracting officer representative (COR); and<br />11. describe the system it will use for documenting and retaining the results of the review. <br /><br />The intent of the Resident FTE Assessment Program and this requirement is not to replace the work conducted by auditors on behalf of the Medicare program, but upon award of the this contract, but to use such audit results and build on them. As required by the CHGME legislative mandate, the offeror shall determine any changes to the resident FTE counts, initially reported to program and used to determine interim payment to children hospitals, within the FY time constraints mandated by CHGME Payment Program law. The final audited FTE resident counts will then be reported to hospitals and program and used to make the final payment determination for each of the children hospitals applying for funds.</p>

Review the work schedules<br />3. Plan for contractor coordination and communications with the COR<br />4. Answer any questions from the contractor.</p>
<p>Task 2: Execute Resident FTE Assessment Program</p>
<p>The Contractor shall implement the Resident FTE Assessment Program based on the approved methodology, auditing the resident FTE counts reported by children's hospitals in their initial applications for CHGME Payment Program funding for a given FY. The Resident FTE Assessment shall consist of three (3) levels (or types) of review (DCs, DRs, and FRs) and occur over a nearly 6-month period (October 1 - March 15) during the FY for which payments are being made. The Resident FTE Assessment Program shall be executed by the contractor as follows: <br /><br />The contractor shall propose the type or levels of review to be conducted, which shall depend primarily on whether a review was previously conducted by another agency/entity or by a fiscal intermediary for a particular MCR period. [Note to Offeror: For proposal purposes assume that seventy-five percent (75%) of the reviews are desk checks and the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) are desk reviews or field reviews). The actual number and types of reviews may vary during performance. The COR will identify and/or approve the type of reviews to be conducted.]</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that all supporting documentation and related resident FTE counts comply with CMS and CHGME Payment Program requirements related to the documentation and counting of resident FTEs as set forth in Section 1886 of the SSA.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />2.1 Auditor Assignment Schedule</p>
<p>The contractor shall assign a CHGME Payment Program-specific fiscal intermediary (FI) (hereinafter CHGME FI), to assess the resident FTE counts and supporting documentation related to each children's hospital participating in the CHGME Payment Program following a methodology approved by the COR. <br />The contractor shall provide to the COR a spreadsheet (Excel format) with the names, organization, contact information, and hospital assignment(s) of all auditors and CHGME FI participating in the Resident FTE Assessment Program no later than October 7 of each cycle. The CHGME Payment Program recognizes that the CHGME FI assigned to a children's hospital for the Resident FTE Assessment Program may be different from the fiscal intermediary assigned to the children's hospital for the Medicare program (i.e., the CHGME FI may be from a different organization or a different person within the same organization).</p>
<p>2.2 Introductory Letter</p>
<p>DCs and DRs shall commence on October 1 and be completed by January 21 of the same FY. The contractor shall send an introductory letter (hard copy or electronic copy) to all CHGME participating hospitals and the COR no later than October 15 of each cycle. The introductory letter shall include the name and contact information of the CHGME FI and a preliminary list of the information that shall be required from the hospital.</p>
<p>2.3 Desk Check (DC)</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform a DC on (1) MCRs that have been settled by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and are not in the process of being reopened and on (2) MCR periods previously been assessed by the CHGME FI. The assessment shall consist of comparing the resident FTE counts reflected in the most recent CHGME Payment Program application (Form HRSA 99-1) to (1) those reflected in the settled MCR, or (2) the CHGME FIs final resident assessment report from the previous application cycle.</p>
<p>2.3.1 For MCRs that have been settled by the MAC and are not in the process of being reopened the resident FTE assessment shall rely on the MAC's work papers for reconciliation. It is presumed by the CHGME Payment Program, that the MAC has already done a reasonable degree of verification for MCRs that have been settled by the MAC. If the resident FTE count on the settled MCR agrees with the resident FTE count reflected in the CHGME Payment Program application and there are no questions related to the MAC's work papers or the level of review conducted for Medicare purposes, then the contractor shall prepare a report summarizing the findings.</p>
<p>2.3.2 If, however, after reviewing the MAC's work papers the CHGME FI determines that the MCR was settled by the MAC without review for whatever reason the CHGME FI shall implement a DR following consultation with and approval from the COR. If Medicare re-opens a previously settled MCR, then that MCR as it relates to the CHGME Payment Program shall undergo a DR.</p>
<p>2.3.3 If a hospital filing a low- or no-utilization MCR has requested a reopening of a MCR period that was previously assessed by the CHGME FI, the CHGME FI shall implement a DR following consultation with and approval from the COR. Only the re-opened items shall be reviewed as part of the DR process.</p>
<p>2.4 Desk Review (DR)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct a DR on (1) MCRs that have been settled by the MAC and are in the process of being reopened; (2) MCRs that have not been settled by the MAC; (3) MCR periods that have not been previously assessed by a CHGME FI; and (4) MCR periods previously assessed by the CHGME FI with unresolved variances (e.g. DC with unresolved variances). The hospital's supporting documentation shall be reviewed for resident FTE count accuracy.</p>
<p><br />2.4.1 The Contractor, after consultation with the COR, shall notify each children's hospital concerning requested documentation. All documents shall be delivered to the contractor by children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program. The documentation shall be postmarked within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the request (for documentation) from the contractor. The COR is to be notified by the contractor upon receipt of the requested documentation from each participating children's hospital. The contractor shall submit to the COR a list of the hospitals that submitted and those that did not submit their documentation and a copy of the checklist that summarizes the type of documentation requested and received from each of the children's hospitals.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Each DR shall begin with an assessment of supplied documentation to ensure acceptability for purposes of program review and completeness as necessary to determine resident FTE counts. The contractor, using email, shall notify the appropriate hospital representative (form HRSA 99, line 5) acknowledging receipt of the requested supporting documentation within three (3) calendar days. The acknowledgment shall include a checklist of the documents received. The documentation shall be examined to assess the number of weighted and unweighted resident FTEs.</p>
<p>Where documentation is found to be either incomplete or information is irregularly reported, the hospital shall be notified of such deficiencies in a time period no less than ten (10) calendar days subsequent to the inception of the DR. Response from the hospital shall be required within five (5) calendar days. If the documentation, once revised, is still considered unacceptable, the contractor shall notify the hospital and the COR within five (5) calendar days. Hospitals notified shall have ten (10) calendar days to respond with completed/revised documentation.</p>
<p>2.5 Field Review (FR)</p>
<p>A FR, which is the most intensive and costly of the three levels of review, is a resident FTE assessment conducted on the hospital site and focuses primarily on issues that could not be resolved during the DC and/or DR. FRs shall commence on or after November 1 of the subject FY and shall be completed by March 1 of the same FY.</p>
<p>2.5.1 The Contractor shall provide a proposal of which children's hospitals should receive planned FRs and shall include a detailed list of the specific triggers for each hospital included by no later than October 21 of subject FY. The contractor shall provide a proposal of which children's hospitals should receive responsive FRs and shall include a detailed list of the specific triggers for each hospital included within seven (7) days of identifying one or more specific triggers. The proposal shall include the following: the hospital name; the specific trigger(s); estimated beginning and ending date of audit; cost estimate for additional labor and expenses needed to conduct FR.</p>
<p>2.5.2 A FR shall be performed for one of the following three situations: 1) the children's hospital has an extremely large amount of documentation or is located in close proximity to CHGME FI home office; 2) the children's hospital has one or more specific trigger(s) identified in the previous year's audit; or 3) the children's hospital has issues that cannot be resolved during the current year's DC and/or DR. For reference purposes the first two types of FRs will be referred to as a planned FRs and the latter as a responsive FR. A list of specific triggers for FRs will be provided to the contractor by the COR upon commencement of the Resident FTE Assessment Program for each cycle.</p>
<p>2.5.3 The scope and level of the FR shall be determined through close collaboration with the COR. The COR or other CHGME Payment Program representatives may accompany the contractor on FRs. The COR shall be notified, in writing, of proposed travel for either planned or responsive FR within fifteen (15) business days from the date approval to perform FR is received from the COR. The final determination of the number, extent, and hospitals subject to FRs shall be determined mutually by the contractor and COR.</p>
<p>2.5.4 The determination of dates to begin the FR shall allow adequate preparation on the part of subject hospitals and personnel, and as such at least fifteen (15) business days shall be allowed between notification of the hospital that it shall be subject to FR (in writing) and commencement of the FR process. Alternatively, the hospital and contractor shall agree upon any date of mutual choosing. The FR shall be performed on-site at the hospital and affiliated institutions by the contractor.</p>
<p>2.5.5 Contractor shall hold an entrance conference on-site with each children's hospital approved for FR by the COR at the start of the hospital's FR, to establish administrative procedures and identify the contact person from the children's hospital to obtain supporting documentation and information during the FR. The contractor shall provide the COR with a 30-day advance notice of the time, place, and conference call-in information for all entrance conferences. It shall include a review of the materials requested when the hospital was informed of the FR. The COR or designated CHGMETB staff may attend or participate via conference call in the entrance conference. In addition, the contractor shall schedule an exit conference at this time though changes in dates may become necessary as agreed upon by contractor and subject hospital staff.</p>
<p>2.5.6 A FR shall include meetings with the hospital liaison as well as those responsible for the preparation of the documentation used in determination of FTE resident counts. The hospital shall have the appropriate personnel present or accessible, provide a work area for the contractor, advise the contractor of work hours and building access, provide time frames for conducting the review, and provide the contractor with appropriate contacts needed to perform the review. All objectives of the FR shall be met and the review shall be cross-referenced to the CHGME Payment Program application procedure and all conclusions shall be substantially supported.</p>
<p>2.5.7 The Contractor shall conduct a final exit conference with each children's hospital approved for FR by the COR at the end of the hospital's FR. The contractor shall provide the draft report to the hospital, identify adjustments, and discuss potential adjustments in the FTE counts, to inform the hospital of the next steps in the review process and the time frame for responding to any proposed adjustments. The contractor shall provide the COR with a 5-day advance notice of the time, place, and conference call-in information for all exit conferences. The COR or designated CHGMETB staff may attend or participate via conference call in the entrance conference.</p>
<p>2.6 Audit Completion Procedures for DC, DR, and FR</p>
<p>2.6.1 All calculated fields relating to the determination of resident FTE counts based upon the supplied documentation shall be examined for mathematical accuracy. Discrepancies that are clearly mathematical in nature shall be clarified with the hospital's representative where appropriate without further action once corrections and accompanying explanations are received in writing from the hospital's authorizing official.</p>
<p>2.6.2 The contractor shall develop, examine, and resolve overlap reports generated by the Intern and Resident Information System (IRIS) based upon IRIS or IRIS proxy data provided by each hospital. If the resident FTE count for a given MCR period as determined by the contractor agrees with the resident FTE count submitted on the CHGME Payment Program application, then the contractor shall prepare a report summarizing the findings. The summary shall be submitted to the COR for review on interim basis, as each is completed.</p>
<p>2.6.3 In some cases, determination of resident FTE counts by the contractor may differ from those reported in the initial application for CHGME Payment Program funding by the participating children's hospital. If it is determined that a hospital requires modifications of their resident FTE counts, the contractor shall attempt to resolve such conflicts directly with hospital personnel responsible for application preparation and program administration. The contractor shall suggest methods in their proposal to resolve conflicts in FTE resident counts including overlaps. The COR shall be apprised of all conflicts as well as the resolution of such conflicts.<br />2.6.4 Upon completion of the DC, DR, and FR, the contractor shall prepare the final Resident FTE Assessment Report for each hospital that applied for CHGME funding which shall include a summary of the results of the audit and illustrate the individual findings of the review, the inclusion of the latest salient information obtained from the hospital, and references to the appropriate law(s), regulation(s), or manual source(s) that support the adjustments to the resident FTE counts or cap adjustments that may need to be incorporated into a hospital's MCR. There shall be one hospital-specific summary report prepared for each children's hospital summarizing all DC, DR and FR activities, the number of resident FTEs assessed for each relevant MCR period, and hospital-specific recommendations to improve the process in future assessments.</p>
<p>2.6.5 The contractor shall prepare a summary report letter to each children hospital indicating the final hospital-specific results of the Resident FTE Assessment Program and indicate the status of all MCR periods reviewed for the reconciliation cycle under assessment: 1) within fifteen (15) business days of completion of the DC or DR, but no later than February 1 of each cycle; or 2) within fifteen (15) business days of completing of the FR, but no later than March 15 for each relevant MCR period. In preparing the report, the contractor shall consider all discussions and evidence provided by the hospitals in reaching its final conclusions.</p>
<p>2.6.6 All summary and final reports for DCs and DRs shall be submitted to the COR for examination and concurrence, on an interim basis no later than February 1 of each cycle or within fifteen (15) business days of the audit completion, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>2.6.7 All summary, final reports, and conference reports (comprising details of the Entrance, Exit, and Final conferences) for FRs shall be submitted to the COR for examination and concurrence, on an interim basis no later than March 15 of the each cycle or within fifteen (15) business days of FR completion, whichever is earlier. All related contractor reports shall also be completed by this date.</p>
<p>2.6.8 All summary reports shall include a detailed explanation of the sampling methodology used to audit the resident FTE counts for each children hospital reviewed.</p>
<p>2.6.9 The Contractor shall notify the children's hospital's MAC, where applicable, of the results of the Resident FTE Assessment Program. The MAC notification shall include, at a minimum, a detailed summary of findings (by MCR period) and any related adjustment reports or work papers that may be required to support the incorporation of the Resident FTE Assessment results into the Medicare system.</p>
<p>All final reports shall be subject to approval by the COR.</p>
<p><br />2.7 Audit Support Activities</p>
<p>For each type of review (i.e., DC, DR, and FR) the contractor shall:</p>
<p>2.7.1 ensure the work papers for each audit performed are: prepared in accordance with GAGAS; thoroughly and systematically reviewed by a supervisor (by the contractor); and include all adjustments identified during the review. The hospitals shall be advised by the contractor of any proposed adjustments and given sufficient time to respond;</p>
<p>2.7.2 include a protocol and/or procedures for addressing, processing and/or handling of appeals in accordance with Section 1878 of the SSA as implemented at 42 CFR 413.75 through 413.83 to the Resident FTE Assessment Program is subject to interpretation (by each CHGME FI);</p>
<p>2.7.3 participate in and provide support, where appropriate, in PRRB proceedings related to the determination of resident FTE counts under the CHGME Payment Program Resident FTE Assessment Program. Although every effort shall be made to resolve disputes prior to the release of the CHGME FI's Resident FTE Assessment final report, hospitals dissatisfied with their final determination of FTE resident counts where the amount in controversy is greater than $10,000 may appeal to the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB);</p>
<p>2.7.4 identify common or potential errors (e.g., overlaps, non-allowable FTEs, part-time status, weighting, and non-provider/non-hospital settings) and provide a protocol for addressing and resolving such errors including errors affecting CHGME Payment Program and non-CHGME Payment Program participants;</p>
<p>2.7.5 identify and address potentially problematic, fraudulent, or inappropriate determinations of resident FTE counts and, if applicable, refer them to COR (and/or CMS or the MAC when the hospital files full MCRs);</p>
<p>2.7.6 ensure that the resident FTE counts reflected in form HRSA 99-1 of participating children's hospitals' applications for CHGME Payment Program are consistent with all applicable guidance, rules and regulations governing the determination of resident FTE counts;</p>
<p>2.7.7 ensure that children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program are held to the same standards (i.e., documentation requirements) irrespective of the independent auditor assigned to each participating hospital. This shall not preclude CHGME FIs from requesting additional information or clarification from participating children's hospitals on their resident FTE counts or supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>2.7.8 address and incorporate new CMS-related or CHGME Payment Program-specific statutory or programmatic changes affecting the assessment, documenting, or reporting of resident FTEs into the Resident FTE Assessment Program.</p>
<p>Task 3: Monthly Progress Reports and Conference Calls</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit monthly progress reports containing information on activities carried out during the month, proposed scheduled hospital review dates, actual review completion dates, individual hospital results (including FTE resident counts), problem(s) encountered and their solutions, and hours of labor and expenditures by task. Details of hospital cost reports reviewed shall be included in these reports. These reports shall be due by the close of business on the 7 day of the month for activities performed during the prior month. The Contractor shall advise the COR, in writing, as soon as possible, of any matters coming to its attention during the course of the Resident FTE Assessment Program, which, in the contractor's opinion, indicate the need for additional examination or guidance. During the Resident FTE Assessment Program (from October 1 to March 15 of each FY), the contractor shall hold weekly conference calls with the COR to discuss any issues related to DCs, DRs, and/or FRs.</p>
<p>Task 4: Annual IRIS data</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a summary of audited IRIS data files from each hospital reviewed during the Resident FTE Assessment Program within 45 business days of audit completion. The specific data elements and file format in which the data shall be reported will be determined by the COR.</p>
<p>Task 5: Methodology Report Update</p>
<p>Prior to the commencement of the (new) application cycle (i.e., July 1) the contractor shall submit to the COR an updated methodology report (MR) in draft form reflecting any statutory changes, programmatic changes, and/or issues that arose during the Resident FTE Assessment or Medicare audits in the preceding 12-month period that may directly impact the Resident FTE Assessment Program. The COR will provide written comments related to the updated MR to the contractor by August 15. The contractor shall incorporate the COR's comments accordingly and return the MR to the COR for final approval.</p>
<p>Upon final approval, by the COR, the contractor shall distribute the newly revised MR to the CHGME FIs prior to the commencement of the next Resident FTE Assessment cycle.</p>
<p>Task 6: Resident FTE Assessment Program Fiscal Year End Summary Report</p>
<p>Prior to the end of each FY for which payments are being made, the contractor shall prepare a Resident FTE Assessment Program Fiscal Year End Summary Report. The report shall include at a minimum, a summary of the assessment process, type and scope of reviews conducted, audit techniques used to complete the assessments (e.g., sampling), issues addressed, referral to the PRRB and outcomes, lessons learned, improvement items for future assessments (CHGME Payment Program and/or hospital-specific), impact (hospital specific and aggregated) of the Resident FTE Assessment Program on participating children's hospitals (e.g., changes in resident FTE counts) as well as cost benefit and effectiveness. As part of this report, the contractor shall summarize the number of resident FTEs claimed by children's hospitals during the initial application for CHGME Payment Program payments and the final audited resident FTE counts at the end of the audit process for each of the children's hospitals and for each of the MCR periods audited.</p>
<p>Task 7: Develop, Organize, Facilitate, and/or Participate in CHGME Payment Program-Specific Conferences, Meetings, and Training Sessions</p>
<p>At the request and approval of the COR, the contractor shall develop, organize and/or facilitate no more than 6 (either via web or in-person) CHGME Payment Program-specific training sessions for CHGME FIs and/or children's hospitals participating in the CHGME Payment Program and other interested parties. Training sessions may be held as needed and/or required to educate the CHGME FIs and/or participating children's hospitals (not to exceed sixty-five) about CHGME Payment Program-specific nuances and auditing requirements in order to successfully carry out the goals of this contract. The COR will inform the Contractor at least 15 days prior to an web-based training session and at least 45 days prior to an in-person training event. Topics addressed shall include, but are not limited to, statutory changes, programmatic changes, and issues that arose during the Resident FTE Assessment or Medicare audits that may directly impact the CHGME Payment Program, the Resident FTE Assessment Program, or its participants.</p>
<p>At the request of the COR, the contractor shall participate in meetings and conferences initiated by the CHGME Payment Program including, but not limited to technical assistance conference calls with participating children's hospitals and public hearings.<br /><br />Task 8: Propose Intern Resident Information System (IRIS) Software Modification</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a proposal on the modification of the current IRIS system to eliminate CHGME Payment Program dependency on the current DOS based software program, as utilized by the CMS to assess unweighted and weighted resident FTE count. The proposal shall include the most cost effective options for a modified system, as well as details on the methodology that would be used to transition seamlessly to an independent, updated system. The contractor shall provide the IRIS software modification proposal no later than September 30th of the base year.</p>
<p>Task 9: Handling of Working Papers</p>
<p>All working papers shall become the property of HRSA's CHGME Payment Program following completion of each hospital-specific resident FTE assessment and the contract as a whole. The contractor shall maintain files for each hospital that can assist in either explaining the results of the DCs, DRs and/or the FRs for a given CHGME Payment Program year, and for assessment of data submitted by CHGME Payment Program applicants in future years. The contract is restricted from publishing any of the audit findings without the written approval of the COR and HRSA's Office of Communications. HRSA is aware that the contractor shall develop and maintain electronic working papers for many of its review operations. While HRSA supports this methodology, the CHGME Payment Program reserves the right to approve of the type, format and the submission of electronic files. The COR will direct the contractor where and when to send the working papers prior to the completion of the contract. (End of SOW)</p>

<p>&bull; In blocks entitled, Amount and Total, enter the total dollar amount of this billing. <br /><br />A. Completion of Summary of Expenditures-This page follows directly behind the Form <br />SF 1034 and contains two main categories of information: 1) gross summary of costs by category showing amount previously claimed, amount claimed under this voucher, and cumulative through this voucher and 2) necessary certifications and signature.</p>
<p>1. Gross Summary-include only major categories of costs in the order illustrated.</p>
<p>2. Certifications and Signature are illustrated in Exhibit B. The Certification of Costs/Fee is mandatory; the Price Stabilization Certification is required only when called for in the Submission of Invoices and Place of Payment article of the contract. The next page in order should be the SF 1035.</p>
<p>B. Completions of Form 1034-On the "Detail" Form 1035, provide a breakdown to support the total amount cited in both Form 1034 and Summary of Expenditures. The purpose of the detailed information is to assist the HRSA Contracting officer and program personnel in relating costs incurred to work performed. The several categories of cost will be itemized and described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Direct labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for work performed directly for the contract and pursuant to its terms. Such labor costs (excluding fringe benefits and overtime premium pay) will be billed as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide the job title or classification of the worker and provide for each classification: the number of hours worked, the hourly rate, and the total wage or salary. The name of the worker should be provided, but when a great number of routine workers are involved, the position classifications only will suffice.</p>
<p>The cost of direct labor charged to the contract must be supported by time records maintained in the contractor's office; if salaries are involved, reasonable estimates on a post basis may be used in lieu of time records.<br /><br />2. Fringe benefits are to be treated according to the contractor's established practice:</p>
<p>&bull; If fringe benefits, bonuses, etc. are included in the overhead pool, no specific entry is required.</p>
<p>&bull; Fringe benefits can be treated as direct costs, in which case enters the fringe benefits expressed as a percentage factor of the direct labor base or show the Actual Fringe Benefits cost.</p>
<p>3. Materials and supplies should include only those items that the contractor normally treats as "direct costs". Bill these costs under major classifications or categories such as office supplies, chemicals, electronics parts, etc., unless any one particular item within a class exceeds $300.00, in which case all such item(s) exceeding $300.00 must be specifically identified.</p>
<p>Note: Under no circumstances shall any item of non-expendable equipment be included within these classifications (see 8 below).</p>
<p>4. Premium pay of any kind (including overtime) must be authorized by the Contracting Officer in advance. Billings for unauthorized premium pay cause frequent delays in payment due to suspensions and exchange of correspondence. Generally such pay is not included in the direct labor base and should not be included in the billing for "direct labor" unless the contractor has consistently followed this practice in the past as a matter of policy. Make entries as follows:<br /><br />1. In Summary of Expenditures -List as a single item.</p>
<p>2. In SF 1035-itemize for each position or job category referencing the Contracting Officer's (CO) letter of authorization. Note on Special Authorizations: According to the contract, certain costs require specific authorization in writing by the CO. Whenever, the voucher includes costs pursuant to CO authorization, include for example, the reference: "CO letter (date)" or "approval number 57/74/115" if the CO cites said number in his letter.</p>
<p>5. Travel, as authorized by the contract, shall include the following in the SF 1035.</p>
<p>a. Travel by contractor shall provide:<br />&bull; Name of traveler or title<br />&bull; Dates of departure and return to departure point<br />&bull; Transportation costs<br />&#61607; If claim for subsistence is on per diem basis, show number of days, rate, and amount, as authorized in contract. If claim is based on actual cost of subsistence, show on a daily basis the amounts claimed for lodging and meals separately.<br /><br />&#61607; References to Contracting Officer's letter of authorization if approval is necessary</p>
<p>b. Travel by consultants shall provide detail similar to contractor travel above.</p>
<p>6. Consultant fees must reflect each consultant's name, daily honorarium, and number of days claimed. Travel for consultants (if applicable) must be itemized separately. <br /><br />7. Subcontract requires the name of each subcontractor involved and the dollar amount claimed. Costs claimed by cost reimbursement subcontractors must be on an "as incurred" basis and subcontractor backup information similar to the SF 1035 must be obtained and attached for each subcontractor. <br />8. Equipment is an article of personal property, complete in itself, that is of a durable nature with an expected service life of one year or more. Equipment does not ordinarily lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put to use. For the purposes of invoicing and reporting under HRSA contracts, the definition of non-expendable property and equipment are equivalent because the HRSA definition of non-expendable property does not include a dollar limitation. (The standard definition of "non-expendable property" considers items costing $200.00 or more-excluding transportation, installation, taxes-with a useful life of a year or more and property sensitive to conversation to private use (no cost limit).</p>
<p>Therefore, when billing for non-expendable property (equipment) costs, the Contractor must attach live (5) copies of a completed form, HEW 565 Report of Non-expendable Government Property in Possession of Contractor, to the original invoice copy. The Contractor will retain the sixth copy. Only that property being billed for during the applicable billing period shall be included in the HEW 565. In addition, one (1) copy of each vendor invoice covering purchased property shall be attached to the original invoice.</p>
<p>9. Overhead will be charged at provisional rates resulting from audit determination and\or negotiation. Provisional rates will apply pending the establishment of final negotiated overhead rates for the contractor's fiscal year.</p>
<p>10. Other direct costs are minor costs that cannot be placed within any of the categories listed above. Identify by categories to the extent both possible and reasonable.</p>
<p>11. Fixed fee, when applicable, should be billed by prorating the negotiated total fixed fee to costs incurred. Applying a fee percentage to the fee base will achieve this effect. Refer to the contract provisions for guidance.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Block 1 - Name/Address of Contractor: Self-explanatory.<br />Block 2 - Type of Report: Indicate type of report. Note that Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) reports are generally not cumulative, but should assess only the performance since the previous report.<br />Initial - Required only if Period of Performance is greater than 365 days (otherwise, only Final report is necessary). Should cover no more than 12 months of actual performance, but period may begin after award date in case of protests or delayed starts.<br />Intermediate - Required every 12 months after Initial report, upon change in program/project management responsibility, or transfer of contract award to a different contracting activity. Also recommended upon change in Assessing Official (AO).<br />Final - Required at contract completion or termination.<br />Out-of-Cycle - Written only if there is a significant change in performance since the last report, at Government's discretion or request of contractor. Address only the areas in which performance has changed. No more than 2 CPARS should be completed in a single year.<br />Addendum - Written at Government's discretion to evaluate close-out, warranty performance, or other administrative requirements.<br />Block 3 - Period of Performance: Use MM/DD/YYYY format. Initial period of performance should not cover less than six months of actual performance.<br />Delayed Starts, Protests, or Phase-In Periods - Initial reporting period may be more than twelve months from date of contract award in case of delayed starts or protests, but should cover only twelve months of actual performance. Initial reports covering more that twelve months of performance, such as for phase-in periods, must be approved by the CPAR Focal Point and coordinated with the contractor.<br />Intermediate/Final Reports - Should cover a twelve month period of performance. Exceptions for special circumstances must be approved by the CPAR Focal Point.<br />Out-of-Cycle Reports - Should only cover the time period which overlaps the regularly scheduled performance period and demonstrates a significant change in performance which alters the assessment in one or more areas since the last performance period.<br />Block 4 - Contract Information: Use the contract number as identified on the contract, except in the case of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA), Blanket Purchasing Agreements (BPA), General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, and other service/agency orders. If an order/call is issued under a BOA, BPA, GSA schedule, or other service/agency contract/agreement, the contract number in CPARS should match the master contract number. The order number field should be used to reflect the contract/schedule/agreement number for the order/call.<br />Block 5 - Contracting Office: Enter our Government Contracting Office number, 00250. <br />Block 6 - Location of Contract Performance: Self-explanatory.<br />Block 7a-b - Contracting Officer and Phone Number: Self-explanatory.<br />Block 8a-b - Award Date and Effective Date: The Award Date is the date the contract award is made, while the Effective Date is the date performance actually begins.<br />Block 9 - Completion Date: Enter last possible date of contract performance (e.g., the last calendar day of the last option period).<br />Block 10 - N/A<br />Block 11 - Awarded Value: Enter the total value of the contract, including unexercised options. For delivery/task order contracts where orders will be assessed under a single CPAR, enter the maximum ordering amount under the contract, including options. For delivery/task order contracts where orders will be assessed on an individual basis, enter the awarded value of the individual order. For BOAs/BPAs where orders/calls will be assessed individually, enter the awarded value of the individual order.<br />Block 12 - Current Contract Dollar Value: Enter the current obligated amount including modifications and options that have been exercised. For incentive contracts, state the target price or total estimated amount. For delivery/task/job order contracts where orders will be assessed under a single CPAR, state the total amount obligated on all delivery orders, including modifications. For delivery/task/job order contracts where orders will be assessed on an individual bases, state the current obligated amount of the individual order, including modifications. For BOAs/BPAs where orders will be assessed individually, state the current obligated amount of the individual order, including modifications. <br />Block 13 - Basis of Award: Enter "Competitive" or "Non-competitive" (i.e., if sole-sourced with justification, or under the dollar threshold). If for a single order/call, enter basis of award for that order/call.<br />Block 14 - Contract Type: Enter contract type (for example, CR, FFP, LH, etc.), and enter predominant contract type followed by secondary type, if any.<br />Block 15 - Key Subcontractors: Identify subcontractor(s) performing either a critical aspect of the contracted effort or more than 25% of the dollar value of the effort. If possible, include the amount of subcontract costs of the total contract effort. If more than two key subcontractors, attach additional page(s).<br />Block 16 - Program Title and Phase of Acquisition: Provide a descriptive narrative of the program. Spell out all abbreviations and acronyms. Identify the type of services (for example, professional services, maintenance, installation, or information technology services). <br />Block 17 - Contract Effort Description: Provide a description of the contract effort that identifies the key requirements and/or type of effort. This section is of critical importance to future source selection officials; the description should be detailed enough so that it can be used in determining the relevance of this program to future source selections. It is important to address the complexity of the contract effort and the overall technical risk associated with accomplishing the effort. Ensure acronyms are identified. For task/delivery order contracts, state the number of orders issued during the period.<br />Block 17a - Small Business Utilization: Answer all questions in spaces provided; enter "N/A" if not applicable.<br />Block 18 - Evaluation Areas: Evaluate each area based on the following criteria:<br />1. Each area assessment must be supported by objective data (or subjective observations) in narrative form in the "Comments" section. Facts to support specific areas of evaluation must be supported by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COR).</p>
<p>2. The amount of risk inherent in the effort should be recognized as a significant factor and taken into account when assessing the contractor's performance. When a contractor identifies significant technical risk and takes action to abate those risks, the effectiveness of these actions should be included in the comments supporting the Block 18 ratings.</p>
<p>3. The CPAR is designed to assess prime contractor performance only. In those evaluation areas where subcontractor actions have significantly influenced the prime contractor's performance in a negative or positive way, record the subcontractor actions in Block 20.</p>
<p>4. Evaluate all areas which pertain to the contract under evaluation; any area which does not pertain to the contract should be marked not applicable ("N/A").</p>
<p>5. When performance has changed from one period to another such that a change in ratings results, the narrative in Block 20 must address each change.</p>
<p>6. The Assessing Official should use customary industry quantitative measures where they are applicable if the contract is for commercial products.</p>
<p>7. Ratings will be in accordance with the following definitions in Attachment B.</p>
<p>Block 18a - Quality of Product or Service: Assess the contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). List and assess any sub-elements to indicate different efforts where appropriate. Include, as applicable, information on the following: <br />&bull; Are reports/data accurate? <br />&bull; Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract? <br />&bull; Does the contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? <br />&bull; What degree of Government technical direction was required to solve problems that arise during performance? <br />Block 18b - Schedule: Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or affect the schedule variance). <br />This assessment of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or affect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should, therefore, be noted in the evaluation.</p>
<p>Block 18c - Cost Control (Not required for Firm-Fixed Price or Firm-Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment): Assess the contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost. Include, as applicable, the following information: <br />&bull; Does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actuals)? <br />&bull; Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings? <br />&bull; Were billings current, accurate and complete? <br />&bull; Are the contractor's budgetary internal controls adequate? <br />Assessment information regarding performance under an Undefinitized Contractual Action (UCA) shall be included in the annual evaluation. If the final negotiated contract type is not a cost-type, cost information for the period the UCA was in effect shall be included under the cost element. The contractor's performance under the UCA shall be separately identified but considered in the overall annual ratings.</p>
<p>Block 18d - Business Relations: Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. Include, as applicable, information on the following:<br />&bull; Is the contractor customer service oriented?<br />&bull; Is interaction between the contractor and the government satisfactory or does it need improvement? <br />&bull; Include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor's management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) if a substantial amount of GFP has been provided to the contractor under the contract. <br />&bull; Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs. Consider efforts taken to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall prime contractor performance. <br />&bull; Assess the prime contractor's effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor's team. <br />Block 18e - Management of Key Personnel: Assess the contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. For example:<br />&bull; How well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract, with the person who filled the key position? <br />&bull; Did the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively? <br />&bull; If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this? <br />&bull; If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract schedule? <br />Block 18f - Utilization of Small Business: If award is to other than a small business, FAR Subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637 contains statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business Subcontracting Program. Assess whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Business (including Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian Tribes) (including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (which also includes ANCs and Indian Tribes), Women Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Historically Black Colleges and Minority Institutions and ANCs and Indian Tribes that are not Small Disadvantaged Businesses or Small Businesses) to participate in contract performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract. <br />&bull; Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Businesses and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (when required) and DFARS 252.219-7003 (deviation), Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts). Where applicable, assess compliance with DoD comprehensive subcontracting plan (DFARS 252.219-7004 (deviation), Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program)) including any program specific data required in the contract. Assess any small business participation goals which are stated separately in the contract (DFARS 215.304.) Assess achievement on each individual goal stated within the contract or subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved. <br />&bull; It may be necessary to seek input from the Small Business specialist, Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) in regards to the contractor's compliance with these criteria, especially when a comprehensive plan is submitted. In cases where the contractor has a comprehensive subcontracting plan, request Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Manager to provide input including any program specific performance information. <br />&bull; For contracts subject to a commercial subcontracting plan, the Utilization of Small Business factor should be rated "satisfactory" as long as an approved plan remains in place, unless liquidated damages have been assessed by the contracting officer who approved the commercial plan (see FAR 19.705-7(h)). In such case, the Utilization of Small Business area must be rated "unsatisfactory". <br />&bull; This area must be rated for all contracts and task orders that contain a small business subcontracting goal. <br />&bull; Ratings will be in accordance with definitions described in Attachment 2, "Evaluation Ratings Definitions (Utilization of Small Business)." <br />&bull; In accordance FAR 19.705-2(e) a contract may have no more than one subcontracting plan. Evaluations of the utilization of small business are required for contracts and orders placed against basic ordering agreement (BOA) and blanket purchase agreement (BPA) if a subcontracting plan is required. Evaluations of utilization of small business for single-agency task orders and delivery orders (to include Federal Supply Service (FSS)) are not required and shall not be accomplished unless the contracting officer determines that such evaluations would produce more useful past performance information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation. Execution of any subcontracting plan may be addressed in block 20.<br />Block 18g - Other Areas: Specify additional evaluation areas that are unique to the contract, or that cannot be captured elsewhere on the form. More than one type of entry may be included, but should be separately labeled. If extra space is needed, use Block 20. <br />&bull; If the contract contains an award fee clause, enter "award fee" in the "Other Areas" Block (18g). The Assessing Official (AO) should translate the award fee earned to adjectival ratings which could prove more useful for using past performance to assess future performance risk in upcoming source selections. If award fee information is included in the CPAR, use Block 20 to provide a description for each award fee. Include the scope of the award fee by describing the extent to which it covers the total range of contract performance activities, or is restricted to certain elements of the contract.<br />&bull; If any other type of contract incentive is included in the contract (excluding contract shareline incentives on fixed price or cost-type contracts), it should be reported in a manner similar to the procedures described above for award fee (by entering "Incentive" in Block 18g). <br />&bull; Use Block 18g in those instances where an aspect of the contractor's performance does not fit into any of the other blocks on the form.<br />Block 19 - N/A</p>
<p>Block 20 - Assessing Official Narrative: A factual narrative is required for all assessments regardless of rating. Cross-reference the comments in Block 20 to their corresponding evaluation area in Block 18. Each narrative statement in support of the area assessment must contain objective data. An exceptional cost performance assessment could, for example, cite the current underrun dollar value and estimate at completion. A marginal assessment could, for example, be supported by information concerning personnel changes or schedule delinquency rate. Key personnel familiar with the effort may have been replaced by less experienced personnel. Sources of the data used by the AO for the assessment may include customer/field surveys or evaluation of contractor reports. The Contracting Officer should be contacted to ensure that all applicable data has been incorporated. Block 20 comments may be up to 16,000 characters (approximately three pages) in the CPARS Automated Information System (AIS). <br />&bull; The AO must choose the applicable choice to the following statement after Block 20: "Given what I know today about the contractor's ability to execute what he promised in his proposal, I (definitely would not, probably would not, might or might not, probably would or definitely would) award to him today given that I had a choice."<br />Block 21 - AO Signature: The Assessing Official must enter his/her information and sign and date the form prior to making it available to the contractor for review.</p>
<p>Block 22 - Contractor Comments: Completed at the option of the contractor. The contractor's narrative comments may be up to 16,000 characters (approximately three pages) in length. Attach extra sheets as necessary.</p>
<p>Block 23 - Contractor Representative Signature: The contractor representative reviewing/commenting on the CPAR must enter his/her name, title, phone number, email address, FAX number, and sign and date the form prior to returning it to the AO.</p>
<p>Block 24 - RO Comments: The Reviewing Official (RO) (the Contracting Officer or Contracting Specialist) must acknowledge consideration of any significant discrepancies between the AO assessment and the contractor's comments. The RO's narrative comments may be up to 16,000 characters (approximately three pages) in length. Attach extra sheets as necessary.</p>
<p>Block 25 - RO Signature: The RO must enter the required information, and sign and date in the space provided, when completing the CPAR.</p>
<p>EVALUATION RATINGS DEFINITIONS<br />Evaluation Ratings Definitions (Excluding Utilization of Small Business) <br />Rating Definition Note <br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was highly effective. To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were of benefit to the Government. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating. Also, there should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. <br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective action taken by the contractor was effective. To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how it was a benefit to the Government. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified. <br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract. There should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. <br />Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the management tool that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency report or letter). <br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective. To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the management tools used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiencies (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency reports, or letters).</p>
<p><br />NOTE 1: Plus or minus signs may be used to indicate an improving (+) or worsening (-) trend insufficient to change the assessment status. <br />NOTE 2: N/A (not applicable) should be used if the ratings are not going to be applied to a particular area for evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation Ratings Definitions (Utilization of Small Business) <br />Rating Definition Note <br />Exceptional Exceeded all negotiated subcontracting goals or exceeded at least one goal and met all of the other negotiated subcontracting goals for the current period. Had exceptional success with initiatives to assist, promote, and utilize small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business (VOSB) and service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB). Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Went above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan and other small business requirements of the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it constitutes an Exceptional rating. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. Also, there should have been no significant weaknesses identified. <br />Very Good Met all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the traditional socio-economic categories (SB, SDB and WOSB) and met at least one of the other socio-economic goals (HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB) for the current period. Had significant success with initiatives to assist, promote and utilize SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met or exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Endeavored to go above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. There should be no significant weaknesses identified. <br />Satisfactory Demonstrated a good faith effort to meet all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the various socio-economic categories for the current period. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met any other small business participation requirements included in the contract. Fulfilled the requirements of the subcontracting plan included in the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor has addressed or taken corrective action. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified.</p>
<p><br />Yellow/ Marginal Deficient in meeting key subcontracting plan elements. Deficient in complying with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Failed to satisfy one or more requirements of a corrective action plan currently in place; however, does show an interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level and has demonstrated a commitment to apply the necessary resources to do so. Required a corrective action plan. To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event that the contractor had trouble overcoming and how it impacted small business utilization. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency. <br />Red/ Unsatisfactory Noncompliant with FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9, DFARS 252.219-7003 (deviation), and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Showed little interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level or is generally uncooperative. Required a corrective action plan. To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted small business utilization. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an Unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government to notify the contractor of the deficiencies. When an Unsatisfactory rating is justified, the contracting officer must consider whether the contractor made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan required by FAR 52.219-9 and follow the procedures outlined in FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages-Subcontracting Plan.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Plus or minus signs may be used to indicate an improving (+) or worsening (-) trend insufficient to change assessment status. <br />NOTE 2: Generally, zero percent is not a goal unless the Contracting Officer determined when negotiating the subcontracting plan that no subcontracting opportunities exist in a particular socio-economic category. In such cases, the contractor shall be considered to have met the goal for any socio-economic category where the goal negotiated in the plan was zero.<br />&emsp;</p>

<p><br />Rating Guidelines</p>
<p>Quality of Product or Service</p>
<p>0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding<br />Unsatisfactory Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.</p>
<p>Poor Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p><br />Cost Control</p>
<p>0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding<br />Unsatisfactory Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p><br />Timeliness of Performance</p>
<p>0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding<br />Unsatisfactory Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.</p>
<p>Outstanding The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />Business Relations</p>
<p>0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding<br />Unsatisfactory Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.</p>
<p>Fair Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.</p>
<p>Good Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.</p>
<p>Excellent Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.</p>
<p>Outstanding The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".</p>

All subcontractors, except small business concerns, that receive subcontracts in excess of $650,000 ($1,500,000 for construction) must adopt and comply with a plan similar to the plan required by FAR 52.219 9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan."

<p>b. Currently, SSR (annually) must be submitted for the HHS eSRS Agency Coordinator review and acceptance via the eSRS website. (Note: Log onto the OSDBU website to view the HHS Agency Coordinator contact information (http://www.hhs.gov/about/smallbusiness/osdbustaff.html).</p>
<p>Note: The Request for Proposal (RFP) will indicate whether a subcontracting plan is required. Due to the nature and complexity of many HHS contracts, particularly the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the contractor may not be required to submit its subcontracting reports through the eSRS. The Contracting Officer will confirm reporting requirements prior to the issuance of an award. For more information, contact Courtney Carter, Agency Coordinator-eSRS (Courtney.Carter@hhs.gov).</p>
<p>7. Record keeping</p>
<p>FAR 19.704(a) (11) requires a list of the types of records your company will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan. The following is a recitation of the types of records the contractor will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan. These records will include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB source lists, guides and other data identifying such vendors;</p>
<p>b. Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB sources;</p>
<p>c. On a contract by contract basis, records on all subcontract solicitations over $100,000, which indicate for each solicitation (1) whether SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and/or SDVOSB concerns were solicited, if not, why not and the reasons solicited concerns did not receive subcontract awards;</p>
<p>d. Records to support other outreach efforts, e.g., contacts with minority and small business trade associations, attendance at small and minority business procurement conferences and trade fairs;</p>
<p>e. Records to support internal guidance and encouragement provided to buyers through (1) workshops, seminars, training programs, incentive awards; and (2) monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program and requirements; and</p>
<p>f. On a contract by contract basis, records to support subcontract award data including the name, address, and business type and size of each subcontractor. (This is not required on a contract-by-contract basis for commercial plans.)<br />g. Other records to support your compliance with the subcontracting plan: (Please describe)<br />_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>8. Timely Payments to Subcontractors</p>
<p>FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your subcontracts with SB concerns, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns. <br />Your company has established and used such procedures: ________ yes _________ no</p>
<p>9. Description of Good Faith Effort</p>
<p>Maximum practicable utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor. In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take. These steps will be negotiated with the contracting official prior to approval of the plan.<br />____________________________________________________________________</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Technical. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and technical requirements. All offerors who submit the documentation required in FAR 52.212-1 Addendum, Instructions to Offerors, will be considered technically acceptable. All such offerors will be treated equally except for price and past performance records. All other offers that do not contain the stated documents will be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Price. For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the TOTAL PRICE of all CLINS as contained in the schedule. Apparent calculation errors found in an offer may be corrected by the Government. Only US Dollar or Euro currency offers will be accepted in accordance with (IAW) provision 5352.225-9004, Submission of Offers in Other Than United States Currency. All offers that are received in Euro currency will be converted to US Dollars by using the established Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) budget rate, which is currently 0.7491 Euro per US Dollar.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Past Performance. The purpose of past performance evaluation is to assess the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past work records. Past performance will be evaluated for recency, relevancy, and quality of services rendered. Evaluation of past performance will be a critical assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources (questionnaires, CPARS data, customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and any other sources) that may have useful and/or relevant information. One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(4) Award Process: The Government will make an award to the lowest price offeror with an Acceptable past performance rating that is technically acceptable. The Government will first evaluate all submissions for technical acceptability to include submission of required documents. The Government will then evaluate all submissions for price. The lowest price offer will then be evaluated for past performance. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Acceptable", the evaluation process will stop and award will be made to that offeror. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Unacceptable", the Government will evaluate the past performance of the next lowest offeror. This process will continue, as needed, until an offeror is rated "Acceptable" for past performance. This offeror will receive the award. The Government intends to make one award to the offeror meeting the above criteria without discussions, but reserves the right to open discussions at any time in the evaluation process. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />(x) Include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Alt I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with your offer or complete paragraph (b)(2) of 52.212-3 Alt 1, if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

<p>(1) Agency, Contracting Activity.<br />The United States Coast Guard Command, Control, &amp; Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), 4000 Coast Guard Blvd, Portsmouth, VA.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />C3CEN requires a datalogger and replacement datalogger units that are needed to properly test engineered systems for the field. This equipment will be utilized to bring the Coast Guard back to a mission ready status. The USCG intends to sole source its requirement due to the specific nature of the dataloggers.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services. <br />A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: three (3) each, Aanderaa Datalogger, 17 sensor Channels + reference, includes LCD display and 1.5m; MPN: 04001003660 with data and programming cable; PN: 3204<br />Total estimated value: $ 13,500.00</p>
<p>(4) Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition.<br />This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited.<br />This is a single source of supply. The Aanderaa datalogger is a piece of equipment proprietary to the PAWSS system, which is proprietary to the Lockheed Martin VTS system. The reason for purchasing the Aanderaa datalogger is to replace the one that was previously installed on C3CEN's PAWSS baseline. C3CEN requires the item currently being used by the USCG in order to supply field units and maintain standardization.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources a practicable.<br />A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be posted on FEDBIZOPS with the statement that any interested persons/parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes.</p>

<p>(8) Description of Market Research.<br />Market research was conducted by numerous internet searches for other qualified sources. <br />Market research revealed no other sources for the required items. Aanderaa Data Instruments is the OEM.<br /><br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of full and open competition.<br />Until the USCG installs a PAWSS system not proprietary to Lockheed Martin VTS system purchasing the Aanderaa Datalogger is cost effective to the Government. This item is currently installed throughout the USCG and will be purchased to backfill Stock Supplies. The Aanderaa Datalogger is proprietary equipment.</p>
<p>(10) List of sources that expressed an interest in this acquisition.<br />No other interest has been expressed at this time.</p>
<p>(11) Actions the agency may take to remove barriers to the competition before any subsequent acquisition for services required. <br />None at this time.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the Offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local Government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

<p>(b) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.</p>
<p>(c) This solicitation is a total small business set aside.</p>
<p>(d) The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />-Technical / Quality Approach<br />-Management<br />-Past Performance<br />-Price</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the minimum terms and conditions of this solicitation may result in removal of the Offeror's proposal from further consideration for award. Only one contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The proposal should be written so that logistics and engineering oriented personnel can make a through proposal evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether the approach meets the requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey of the Contractor's facility prior to contract award.<br />Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical / Quality Approach:</p>
<p>1. The Offeror's methodology and overall technical approach required for the services identified in the Statement of Work. The technical approach shall be specific, detailed and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective Offeror has a thorough understanding of the technical requirements. This includes, but is not limited to the following:<br />a. off-site / on-site instrument calibration and repair<br />b. calibration decal tagging<br />c. repair reports<br />d. expanded data reports<br />e. certifications and manuals<br />f. specific software and training<br />g. warranty policy<br />h. calibrations traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST</p>

<p>4. The Offeror shall provide a copy of all certification(s) they currently hold and a copy of the certificate of accreditation of their off-site laboratory. Additionally, the Offeror should briefly describe their off-site laboratory, including but not limited to calibration / repair capabilities, capacity and limitations.</p>
<p>5. The Offeror shall explain in detail their intended method of pick-up and drop-off of the calibrated / repaired equipment.</p>
<p>6. The Offeror shall explain if they currently have access or provide their plan to gain access to the U.S. Air Force AFCAV program.</p>

<p>8. Information concerning labor allocation and categories, travel, materials, equipment and any information of interest to technical services shall be contained in the technical approach with sufficient detail so that the Offeror's understanding of the statement of work may be adequately evaluated.</p>
<p>Factor II - Management:</p>
<p>1. The Offeror's overall management approach shall provide a realistic allocation of support for the tasks described in the Statement of Work. This includes, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. policies and procedures for managing and directing the effort<br />b. procedures for dealing with unusual or difficult areas encountered during performance<br />c. documentation supporting Offeror's management ability<br />d. capability to manage labor resources<br />e. effectively controlling and reporting of pricing<br />f. policies and procedures for managing performance and resolving problems<br />g. detailed methodology the Offeror will follow in performing the requirements of this contract</p>
<p>2. The Offeror shall demonstrate their capability to effectively manage and respond to fluctuations in workload, manage single and multiple delivery orders, and increase or reduce manpower when required.</p>

<p>5. The Offeror shall explain their process for conducting both criminal and financial employee background checks. Additionally, the Offeror shall state if the background checks are equivalent to the National Agency Check (NAC) or higher.</p>
<p>Factor III- Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide information on two (2) contracts performed by their organization over the past three years that are relevant to this requirement in type of work, size and complexity. The Offeror shall submit Attachment 6, the Past Performance Questionnaire to a minimum of two references for completion and have the references return to the email address shown on the Questionnaire no later than the closing date of this solicitation. <br />Incomplete data will not be considered. The Offeror that represent newly formed entities, without prior contract experience, should list previous contract and subcontract experience of the companies' key personnel.<br />The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an Offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the Offeror. If an Offeror does not provide past performance information, a neutral rating will be assigned for this evaluation factor. <br />Factor IV - Price:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall complete unit and extended prices for the base and option CLINs. The Offeror shall fill-in the total price for all three years within the schedule. The Government will evaluate proposals based on total evaluated price.</p>
<p>After evaluation factors I through III have been evaluated, price will then be considered. Price is substantially less important than the factors listed above; however, as proposals become more equal, price will become the deciding factor for award.</p>
<p>The proposal price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Prices that are extremely high or low in relation to the Government's estimate may be judged unrealistic and may indicate that the Offeror has misunderstood the nature of the work to be performed.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base year requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only one responsible offer is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that Offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) of Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>Additional contract requirements: If the item(s) required in the contract resulting from <br />this solicitation are customarily warranted in the trade by a standard commercial <br />warranty, such warranty shall be incorporated into this contract and thereby provided to <br />the Government at no additional cost. Any standard commercial warranty provided shall <br />be identical to the standard commercial warranty normally offered by the Contractor to <br />the Contractor's most favored customer. Offerors are requested to state the terms and <br />conditions of their standard commercial warranty or to attach a copy of the warranty <br />terms with their proposal. <br /><br />QUOTES ARE DUE BY 12:00 NOON Eastern Standard Time on 31 May 2012 Quotes may be emailed to: Kathleen.M.Lechert@uscg.mil. <br /><br />Point of Contact: Kathy Lechert, Purchasing Agent, Tele. No. 410-762-6920, email <br />address: Kathleen.M.Lechert@uscg.mil.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:</strong><br />Mr. Luis Eduardo Jim&eacute;nez Benedetti<br />Investment Planning Director<br />Terminal Fluvial Andaluc&iacute;a, S.A.<br />Manga, Terminal Mar&iacute;timo<br />P.O. Box 7954<br />Cartagena de Indias, D.T.y C.<br />Colombia<br />Phone: (57) 5 660-7781<br />Fax: (57) 5 660-9004</p>
<p><br />The Grantee (Terminal Fluvial Andalucia, S.A.) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the construction of the Andaluc&iacute;a River Port Terminal.</p>
<p>Grupo Puerto de Cartagena (GPC) and its member companies, specifically the recently formed company Terminal Fluvial Andaluc&iacute;a, S.A. (TFA), are pursuing the development of a river port located on a 365 hectare property near Gamarra, about 496 kilometers upstream from Barranquilla on the Magdalena River.  The Port of Cartagena is considered to be Colombia's premier port and is an important shipping hub for the country as well as for the Caribbean as a whole.  Under the management of Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena (SPRC, the flagship company of GPC), the Port of Cartagena and its sister facility, Terminal de Contenedores de Cartagena ("Contecar"), have experienced a substantial increase in the volume of cargo handled over the last decade.</p>
<p>The objective of this Feasibility Study is to determine the technical and financial viability of, as well as prepare preliminary designs for, a new inland river port along the Magdalena River in Colombia. The study is to consider engineering, technology, and equipment/infrastructure needs required for the development of a modern, cost-effective feeder port to Cartagena and Barranquilla on the Magdalena River that will handle containers, vehicles, and solid and liquid bulk commodities.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $550,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  In addition, the Grantee will provide a cash contribution of $166,667 on a pro rata basis in proportion to the funding being provided by USTDA to partially fund the costs of goods and services required for the completion of the Terms of Reference (USTDA US$550,000: Grantee US$166,667).

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the development of the infrastructure, operational, and business requirements of acquiring and operating a fleet of locomotives on the existing Karachi-Lahore Railway. The Contractor will develop recommendations on anticipated freight volumes, fleet sizing, and financing requirements, as well as tender documents for the procurement of locomotives for Premier Mercantile Services (Pvt.) Ltd. (PMS) (Grantee).</p>
<p>PMS is a developer and operator of port and intermodal transportation facilities, and has concessions to operate, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, a container terminal at the Port of Karachi, a bulk goods terminal at the neighboring Port of Qasim, and an inland container depot near Lahore. The inland container terminal is an important distribution point for northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. The facilities are connected by rail, owned by Pakistan Railways (PR), the Pakistani government's state-owned railway company. However, PR is unable to handle the required volume of freight due to a shortage of properly maintained vehicles. To address the problem, PMS has reached an agreement with PR which will allow PMS to operate its own fleet of freight trains on PR-owned track, thereby augmenting the capacity of one of Pakistan's most important trade corridors.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide technical assistance to the Grantee in the assessment of future freight volumes and transportation requirements to inform the Grantee's decisions regarding the procurement of a fleet of locomotives. This technical assistance will involve the development of bidding documents for the Grantee's use during the procurement process. The Contractor will also provide recommendations on security, and will prepare an operational and business plan for the implementation and efficient operation of the Project, including an assessment of PR's current communications and signaling infrastructure and procedures.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $628,000 grant to PMS from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Question 1: Where is the final destination? 
Answer: US Despatch Agency NY (located in Iselin, New Jersey)

Question 2: Who is the end-user? 
Answer: Pakistani Police

Question 3: Do you accept NON USA origin? 
Answer: Yes

Question 4: Do you accept Indian or Chinese if they meet the specs and NIJ standards? 
Answer: We cannot accept goods from India as there are some restrictions. Regarding Chinese origin, we have no problem as long as they meet the required specification and standards. It would be preferred if vendor can provide the certification from a reputable lab.
Re-Posting Number One:  
QUESTION (May 24, 2012):  The attached specifications mentions: "- Size of vest: All Bullet Proof vests should be Large in size. Total weight of each vest with two insert plates shall not exceed 18 lbs." But does so in what appears to be the Concealable Vest description and conflicts with the line item requesting medium Tactical vests. Do all vests need to be Large? Does the 18 lbs weight requirement apply to the Tactical vests as well? In addition: The plates requested specify ceramic or metal plates. It will be difficult to meet the weight requirements with metal or ceramic plates. Would level III polyethylene plates be acceptable?
ANSWER:  The bulletproof vest in Line Item 001 is different than the Tactical Vests in Lines 004 and 005. Read the specifications document Line Item by Line Item.  Also, the sizes and quantities are identified for each item.  The customer did not specify a maximum weight for Line Items 004 and 005.  The customer wants only ceramic or metal plates for all vests. <BR> <BR>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The purpose of this amendment is to publish the answers to questions received concerning this solicitation. 

 1. In Section 2.0 Requirements, of the Statement of Work (SOW), under Leadership Curriculum, the vendor is required to design leadership curriculum using key elements of the Transformative Leadership Intervention. 
a. Is the Transformative Leadership Intervention an existing VA program or modelor does Transformative Leadership Intervention refer to a program or model created by another organization?

b. What are the required key elements of the Transformative Leadership Intervention? 

--The key elements of the Transformative Leadership Intervention are the elements required in section 2.1.

2. In Section 2.1.2 Leadership Performance Coaching, under Workshop and Performance Coaching Key Features (first bulleted item), the SOW states, Prior to the first workshop, a comprehensive assessment and briefing report will be produced on the readiness of the healthcare system for transformation. 
a. Is this comprehensive assessment and briefing report referring to the same comprehensive organizational development readiness survey specified in Section 2.1.1.2 Organizational Readiness Assessment, or is it referring to a separate, more far-reaching assessment? 

--It is the same.

b. If the two statements refer to the same assessment, it appears that the second requirement is more involved than the first one. Can you explain the discrepancy between the requirement to summarize the results of the 40 VISN participants specified in Section 2.1.1.2 and the requirement to summarize the readiness of the healthcare system for transformation as specified in Section 2.1.2? 

--The two requirements refer to the same element.  We assume that querying the VISN participants  will yield information about the organizations readiness to change.

c. If the two statements refer to different assessments, what is the scope of the assessment on the readiness of the healthcare system for transformation (For example, what constitutes the healthcare system, how many people are in this specified healthcare system, and what are the battery of measures being used?) 

--The healthcare system is the VA New England Healthcare System, VISN 1.  The contractor should propose validated measured to use to assess organizational readiness to change.

a. Does the inclusion of the statement that The 40 participants directly involved in the leadership development intervention will be asked to facilitate a discussion of these challenges with the staff mean that the intention is for these interactions to be turned into the specified video vignettes?

b. How many are several? 

--Contractor is requested to propose a number.

c. What is the scope of these interactive video vignetteshow long should these be, how many interactions are expected in each vignette, what type of interaction is expected, etc.?

d. If the participant-facilitated discussions with the staff are NOT intended to be made into the video vignettes, are the participant-facilitated discussions another initiative for the vendor to design and conduct? If so, what are the parametersi.e. how many sessions, how many facilitators per session, how long should the sessions be, etc.? 

--Yes, the contractor is expected to design and facilitate initial use of the video vignettes.  The number of sessions and number of facilitators and length of the sessions should be proposed by the vendor.

4. In Section 2.1.2 Leadership Performance Coaching, the SOW states, Peer learning teams (e.g. director, clinical chief, nurse executive, administrative director, service line leader, etc.) are to be organized and used to facilitate the development of leadership. 
a. Are the Peer Learning Team members a different set of people than the 40 participants directly involved in the leadership development intervention? 

--No, they are the same people.

--The 40 participants will be selected from these leadership roles.

This will require them to go from learner to teacher with our methods and model. 
a. Is the wording supposed to be with the vendors methods and model? 

--Yes.  However, we intend that the vendors methods and model will become our methods and model as it is incorporated into the participants repertoire of knowledge and skills.

b. If not, what are the methods and model to which it refers? 

--See above.

6. In Section 2.1.2 Leadership Performance Coaching, under Workshop and Performance Coaching Key Features (fifth bulleted item), the SOW states, Each participant will develop a leadership performance plan facilitated by one of our performance coaches.

10.Under 2.1.2, Workshop and Performance Coaching Key Features (Page 5) Third bullet item states several interactive video vignettes are to be developed. Can you provide an exact number and time length for each vignette? The pricing on the proposal will vary greatly depended on number of vignettes to produce and time of each one of them.

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC><p>Request for Information for FDPIR Pilot Project<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for Request for Proposals but instead a Request for Information to solicit constructive feedback from Industry on the government's draft solicitation documents for a new Pilot project for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This valuable information will assist the government in finalizing a comprehensive solicitation package scheduled for FBO release late March 2012. <br /><br />Project Background: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br /><br />Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model. The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.<br /><br />Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated.<br /><br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br /><br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.<br /><br />To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.<br /><br />FNS has drafted the following Performance-based acquisition documents meeting the government's objectives for the Pilot as follows: (1) Statement of Objectives (SOO) by which offerors will respond and from which offerors will develop their Statement of Work and Quality Assurance Plan including Performance Metrics, (2) Evaluation factors, and (3) Pricing structure. <br /><br />The government anticipates awarding one 5-year firm fixed price contract with economic price adjustments in food and fuel costs. Year one of the contract will deploy the Pilot and, if deemed successful in comparison to the performance and costs of the current Warehouse Model, including food costs, continue to increase deployment in option years 1 through 4. The expectation is to have a Nation-wide FDPIR food delivery contract by Year 5. Additionally, the government intends to make award based on best value with technical having paramount consideration over cost. Large businesses will be required to submit a negotiated subcontracting plan that will meet, to the extent practicable, the government's minimum 2012 small business goals.<br /><br />Purpose of Notice: The purpose of this notice is to receive constructive feedback from Industry on the government's Performance-based acquisition documents to determine if the structure is (1) feasible for Industry to prepare a comprehensive proposal, and (2) consistent with Industry best practices for pricing food and transportation costs, including bi-annual EPAs based on price indices.<br /><br />It is not the government's intent to completely modify its current performance-based acquisition model but to ensure that sufficient and accurate information is captured in order for the government to receive comprehensive proposals containing accurate pricing information. Vendors are asked to read the attached documents carefully to fully understand the government's requirements and respond accordingly. Your insight and feedback is valuable to FNS to ensure release of a Request for Proposals ensures competition to the maximum extent practicable.<br /><br />Vendor Responses: Interested firms shall respond by providing answers or recommended changes to the following documents:<br /><br />1) Does the draft SOO contain sufficient information for offerors to respond in years 1 through 5? If not, what other data do you recommend should be included? <br /><br />2) Are the evaluation factors clear and concise for offerors to respond? If not, what other factors do you recommend should be included?<br /><br />3) Does the pricing structure contain sufficient information for offerors to provide fixed unit food prices, overhead/administrative fees/profit and a total fixed unit price? Is it feasible for transportation costs to be a separate line item? If not, how should transportation cost be priced? Provide a thorough rationale to support recommended structure for transportation costs.<br /><br />4) Is it feasible for EPAs to be implemented every 6 months? If not, recommend the frequency and provide a thorough rationale to support the recommendation. <br /><br />5) Is it feasible for unit food prices to remain constant in option years 2 - 5 with the EPA dictating unit prices upwards or downwards? If not, provide a thorough rationale to support the recommended structure.<br /><br />6) Can the government expect quantity discounts as food commodities increase across the 5 year contract life? What other discounts, if any, can the government assume?<br /><br />7) Is the number of pages, for each evaluation factor, sufficient to prepare a comprehensive response? If not, what are the minimum number of pages would you recommend for each factor, keeping in mind a streamlined not voluminous proposal? <br /><br />8) Others?<br /><br />This is a request for information only. The government will not pay for the information prepared or submitted in response to this notice. Vendors interested in this procurement are advised to peruse FBOs for the solicitation's release. Further, the government is not interested in voluminous or marketing data in response to this request. Vendors are asked to respond only to the questions and other information relevant to this notice.<br /><br />Responses are due NLT 2 p.m. March 14, 2012 via e-mail to Richard Hicks, Contracting Officer, at Richard.hicks@fns.usda.gov. FNS is not soliciting questions as part of this Request for Information. However, the Contracting Officer is interested in any other questions, comments or concerns potential offerors may have on this effort for the government's consideration.</p>

<AWARDEE>VAISALA INC., 194 S TAYLOR AVE, LOUISVILLE, CO 80027-3024 US
<DESC>Replace 4-Dimensional Lightning System<br />FFP<br />This project has two main goals with five specific instrument goals: 1) Replace the current Four Dimensional Lightning Detection System (4DLSS) sensors and ingest equipment with a replacement that meets all the current system requirements as defined in the specification requirements listed below. 2) New system to include spares must be delivered no later than 15 June 2012. 3) Installation must be completed by 31 July 2012. 4) On-site training must be completed by 15 Oct 2012. 5) Manuals must be delivered by 15 Nov 2012. Specifically the following equipment must be replaced: 1) detection of lightning aloft functionality of 4DLSS with a suitable replacement that meets the specifications listed below, 2) detection of cloud-to-ground lightning return-strokes that meets the specifications listed below, 3) display of lightning aloft and obsolete display of cloud-to-ground lightning return-strokes that meets the specifications listed below. In addition, the following sets of equipment must be implemented: 1) implement hardware/software upgrades to include the ingest of the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) raw sensor data of cloud-to-ground return-strokes that meets the specifications listed below, and 2) implement hardware/software upgrades to include of ingesting raw sensor data for lighting aloft that is becoming available in NLDN that meets the specifications listed below. Finally, the location accuracy and detection rate of LSS in and around CCAFS/KSC for all possible combinations of sensors shall be provided. Install new hardware and software upgrades prior to the sensor shipment date. The new hardware/software should be backwards compatible and can support both the new and legacy 4DLSS sensors. The Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) contractor will be responsible for collaboration of the project and therefore will be the primary liaison and contractor interface. See attached Statement of Work (SOW) dated 19 Mar 12.

<DESC>This is a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) limiting competition for the Base Operations Support (BOS) to increase scope (W911S0-08-C-0001) and extend the period of performance six months. The current contract is a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), to add and delete facilities and adjust contract ceiling to account for significant mission growth: Growth of Army Personnel, Post mission increase/decrease, numerous Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions, and Fort Eustis's Directorate of Public Works (Army) transition to Civil Engineer Division (Air Force), and associated Individual Job Order (IJO) by direct funding and reimbursable funding for tenet facilities. These transformations address Joint Base Langley - Eustis (JBL-E) mission requirements that are increasing the training and active duty soldiers' tempo significantly.

<DESC>Contractor shall develop practical, relatively inexpensive and widely deployable technology based on near-infrared (NIR) optical spectroscopy to enable definitive diagnoses of early stage dementias and quantitative monitoring of disease progress and response to treatment. In this project, the focus is Alzheimer disease (AD) because of its public health impact and well-characterized neuropathological presentation; dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is included to test and develop the power of VA methods to differentiate disorders with overlapping clinical and neuropathological features. The specific objective is to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of assessing human neuropathology in vivo, by means of non-invasive, near-infrared, optical spectroscopy of the human brain. VA aims are: 1) to identify the unique spectroscopic signatures of plaques, tangles, Lewy bodies, nuclei, etc. in diffuse scattering or reflectance spectra of brain tissue; 2) to develop models of light propagation in the adult human head to enable extraction of these unique signatures from spectra of the brain acquired non-invasively; 3) to develop NIR spectroscopy instrumentation for acquiring such spectra in clinical settings and  4) to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of neuropathologic assessment by non-invasive NIR spectroscopy to enable early detection of disease or injury, using patients in the regional Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) and the Boston University Alzheimers Disease Center (BUADC).
