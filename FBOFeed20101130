<DESC>This synopsis is being provided for information purposes only. NASA Goddard SpaceFlight Center (GSFC) proposes to increase the maximum value of the Mission AssuranceServices contract (MASC) with ManTech SRS Technologies, Inc. NASA GSFC proposes anincrease in the current maximum value of $97,500,000 of the MASC contract by $24,200,000.The MASC contract, NNG07CA18C, supports the NASA GSFC Safety and Mission AssuranceDirectorate, and is a five year Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract with a period ofperformance from December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2011. The level of effort for theexisting scope of work has increased, resulting in the projected maximum value of thecontract no longer being sufficient to sustain task requirements. In addition, theExecutive Branch assigned NASA the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). The addition ofthis new work to the MASC contract in September and October 2010 was unanticipated, andoutside of NASAs control.  As a result, NASA was unable to plan accordingly, and wellenough in advance, to allow adequate time for a new procurement through the competitiveprocess. Based on the actual cost and the projected future cost, the total estimatedvalue of this contract will reach $121,700,000 by November 2011. Hence, GSFC proposes toincrease the maximum contract value by $24,200,000 to cover this anticipated cost. Thescope of work of the existing contract requires the contractor to provide on/off-siteMission Assurance services. The areas of emphasis are Mission Assurance QualityEngineering Services, Systems Safety Services, Reliability Services, operation of theNASA Manufacturing Technology Transfer Center, and Software Assurance and TechnologySupport Services. These services include the personnel, facilities, and materials toaccomplish the tasks. If GSFC attempts to procure these services from any other sourcefor the remainder of the contract, it would cause unacceptable delays. The combination ofdelay due to the competitive process, the time required to transition a new managementteam to coordinate staffing levels and schedules and to become familiar with workrequirements and systems would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA's mission.The interim procurement of these vital services from another source for this period wouldjeopardize the critical milestone schedules for numerous ongoing projects that the MASCcontract supports.   Therefore, ManTech SRS Technologies, Inc. is considered the onlycontractor that can meet NASA GSFCs needs given the term of the contract. This documentand any other related documents to this procurement will be available over the Internet.These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed usinga WWW browser application.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for 25 EA QT625LBE Hybrid Crystal Oscillators and 25 EAQT625LBM Hybrid Crystal Oscillators.NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Q-Tech Corporation. The iLIDS (InternationalLow Impact Docking System) project requires the use of Hybrid Crystal Oscillator, partnumber QT625LBE (Engineering Model) and QT625LBM (Flight Model) for the development ofthe motor power and motor control electronic systems.  Possession of these parts will berequired for data analysis and research while constructing electronic prototype units foriLIDS. Use of the Engineering units in the early development phase is cost effective forthe project. Flight Models are required for final test and verification.4.   Previouscompetition was done for the Engineering Model Hybrid Crystal Oscillator, part numberQT625LBE on contract NNJ10HA33P and shows the manufacturer, Q-Tech Corporation, as beingthe lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor. The Flight Model  Hybrid CrystalOscillator, part number QT625LBM, is a space grade product and due to ITAR and Q-Techtechnical issues , is only sold directly from Q-Tech. Therefore to prevent delays inproject schedule as well as duplication of costs to the Government  by repetitivecompetition efforts of this part, it is beneficial to the Government to award thisprocurement to Q-Tech corporation. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a suite of product development services. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of biopharmaceutical product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services have helped a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter a Phase I trial.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to study control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents (except HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services. (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive, and product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising biopharmaceutical therapeutic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of biopharmaceutical products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of non-traditional, proactive and development-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for promising biopharmaceutical products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These capabilities will allow DMID to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps. The Contractor shall assist DMID staff in providing all support and appropriate documentation needed for preclinical activities to support IND submissions for Phase I and II clinical testing, or Biologic License Applications (BLAs) for advanced products. Specific Task Orders will depend on the status of the candidate(s) as part of an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -210, -211, -600].</p>
<p>The following definitions will apply: Biopharmaceutical Products - Materials that are derived from biotechnology processes including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies and derivatives of monoclonal antibodies; recombinant proteins; peptides; nucleic acid based vectors (siRNA, plasmids); and live, modified-live and/or attenuated entities; Therapeutic - A product intended for use in the cure, mitigation or treatment of disease caused by a pathogen or certain toxins, e.g., botulinum toxin.</p>
<p>The services shall be directed at the following: 1) diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list; 2) emerging and re emerging infectious diseases; 3) antimicrobial resistant and multi drug resistant infections; 4) other bacterial infections; 5) fungal infections; 6) viral infections; and 7) parasitic diseases.</p>

This is an unrestricted procurement. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is $14 million.

This procurement consists of two solicitations, issued in sequence, with the intent to award three or more Firm Fixed Price (FFP) IDIQ MACCs, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.3 Two Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, to (a) successful, responsive, responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) conform(s) to the solicitation and (is) are considered the best value to the Government, considering price and other factors combined.
  

The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $100,000,000. Task orders will range between $50,000 and $5,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.
 Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

The work to be acquired under this MACC is for new construction and repair by (primarily) design-build or (secondarily) fully designed projects of Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems construction, repairs, maintenance and associated work at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility, including but not limited to: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  

Phase One solicitation is a RFQ in accordance with FAR Part 36.3. Phase One will be in accordance with FAR 36.303-1 and will consist of technical approach, technical qualifications, and bonding submissions to be evaluated to determine qualifications.
  The maximum number of Prospective Offeror(s) (PO(s)) that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is six (6), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than six (6) is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting. Phase One qualifications will be based on evaluation of the following: factors: Factor A  Technical Approach; Factor B  Technical Qualifications; Factor C  Bonding Capacity.  After evaluation of Phase One proposals, the contracting officer shall select the most highly qualified Offerors and request that only those Offerors selected submit Phase Two proposals. Unsuccessful Phase One POs will receive notice of their non-selection at the same time.
  Results will not be published in Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS).  Phase One submissions and evaluations will not be carried over into Phase Two.  POs ARE ADVISED SELECTION FOR ADVANCEMENT INTO PHASE TWO MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED.
  
Phase Two solicitation N62473-11-R-0001 is a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 and includes Phase Two evaluation factors developed in accordance with 15.304 and 36.303-2. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the POs selected in Phase One and will be evaluated in accordance with the Phase Two Evaluation Factors.  Phase Two proposals will be accepted only from those POs who have been specifically invited to submit a Phase Two proposal and who receive the Phase Two solicitation from the Contracting Officer.
  Phase Two RFP will be based on evaluation of the following factors: Factor 1  Past Performance; Factor 2  Small Business Utilization; Factor 3  Engineering Solution; Factor 4 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  Phase One qualifications and evaluations will not be considered in the Phase Two evaluations and determination of Best Value. The best value tradeoff source selection process as described in FAR Part 15 will be used for Phase Two to ensure selection of contractors evidencing the best overall capability to perform the anticipated work in a manner most advantageous to the Government in accordance with established evaluation criteria.  

The Government intends to evaluate and award contract(s) without discussions.
  

THE PHASE ONE RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  The RFQ will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://fbo.gov/ on or about December 15, 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center Togus requires contractors to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program for Cumberland and Kennebec counties in the State of Maine.

Through the HCHV program, VA provides coordination of services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain offers from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to homeless veterans, who may also be suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.
Estimated value for this contract to include base plus 4 option years is $250,000 to $500,000.
The intent is to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to multiple awardees with an estimated start date of 1 Jan 2011.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">I. Description:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback concerning its submission. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time. Additionally, the Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that responses should not take the form of a proposal and will not be understood as such. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned. Full requirements will not be provided. This RFI is intended to provide the Government with market research.<strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">II. Strategy:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategic goal is to become more efficient for IT asset management: to be able to effectively count, locate and track asset movement within the datacenter. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although this RFI is focused on data center IT assets, near term solutions must be expandable to other non-IT assets including planes, boats, firearms, canines, horses, non intrusion technology.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">CBP would like to perform a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to confirm RFID usage at the data center is feasible and can support asset management of data center assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the POC is successful, CBP would like to grow the use of RFID within the organization to support asset management. The information derived from the Request For Information would allow CBP to plan a Capability Demonstration and develop a Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS). Dependant upon the progress and information obtained during the POC, CBP reserves the right to change direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The POC should show how manual asset validation, which requires too much labor and only addresses lost assets after the fact, can be eliminated or significantly reduced.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: none; mso-list-ins: 'Nick Martinelli' 20101130T1355"><span><ins datetime="2010-11-30T13:55" cite="mailto:Nick%20Martinelli"></ins></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">III. Purpose:</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">CBP has a significant number of IT assets that must be managed effectively. The primary requirement for asset management is to properly identify these assets. Manufacturer bar codes and CBP-applied asset number tags are two ways assets are currently identified.

These labels are both labor intensive in nature and support a limited amount of information for the asset.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">Therefore, CBP initially seeks an IT RFID Asset Tracking Solution, which provides both real-time location visibility with rules-based alerting and reporting of critical or highly valued equipment and material with a guaranteed 100% in room level accuracy as well as the necessary middleware to provide passive location services for fixed or expendable assets. This capability must interface with existing COTS solutions within the CBP enterprise and this capability needs to be expandable for assets other than IT.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only.  No contract or cooperative agreement will be awarded from this announcement.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest is conducting market research to determine the interests and capabilities of entities who possess the capabilities and expertise to fulfill the requirements of upcoming compensatory mitigation for impacts to aquatic resources in the Puget Sound Area.  The program will establish a compensatory mitigation vehicle such as an in-lieu fee program or a mitigation bank. Compensatory mitigation may be required for both fresh-water riparian wetlands and nearshore aquatic habitat.
 The mitigation program will be established to improve existing aquatic resources, repair a damaged existing aquatic system or naturalize an area that was once an aquatic system, create a brand new aquatic resource system where one never existed, or protect an existing aquatic resource permanently through an appropriate real estate or other legal instrument.

The program will address watershed needs and how locations and types of compensatory mitigation projects address those needs. The determination of compensatory mitigation will be based on the attributes of the impacted site, its type, size, function, and regional characteristics, and the relative benefit-to-cost ratio of the instrument under consideration.
 Other items for consideration include, but are not limited to: landscape scale, historic and potential aquatic resource conditions, and terrestrial connections between aquatic resources.

The Navy may require assistance with a Compensatory Mitigation program and/or project(s) in the Hood Canal including work in Kitsap, Jefferson, and Mason County.  Compensatory mitigation programs may also be implemented in Island and Snohomish Counties.

Entities interested in participating in this work should submit a statement of qualification describing capabilities and experience designing, permitting, or managing an In-Lieu Fee Program or mitigation bank and/or experience with wetlands mitigation or restoration projects and any direct experience or knowledge of compensatory mitigation vehicles including in-lieu fee programs and mitigation bank projects.
  The statement of qualifications should not exceed 10 pages, excluding the attached questionnaire.  If the entity does not currently have an existing In-Lieu Fee program, please state when you intend to submit your draft Prospectus to the Interagency Review Team and when you anticipate approval of your In-Lieu Fee program.

This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, contract award, or cooperative agreement nor will it reimburse the respondent any costs associated with preparation or submitting a response to this notice.  The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.
  All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes. Interested sources must submit their statement of qualifications and questionnaire via e-mail to Ian Robinson, Contract Specialist, NAVFAC NW, e-mail ian.robinson1@navy.mil, phone (360) 476-6748 and Eleanor Drake, Contract Officer/Cooperative Agreement Administrative Officer, NAVFAC NW, e-mail eleanor.drake@navy.mil, phone (360) 396-6707, no later than 30 December 2010.

 It is anticipated that the contract shall be awarded for a period of one year.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE OF SITE ASSESSMENT TEAM SUPPORTThis is NOT a solicitation announcement.  This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA?s Site Assessment Team (SAT)  requirement.  Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form  a binding contract.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.  Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments.  The Government?s evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.). 
DESCRIPTION: The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for EPA?s Site Assessment Team Support.  EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able to provide the technical and analytical services to provide support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 Offices which include New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in assessing and implementing National Priorities List (NPL) activities. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), enacted on December 11, 1980, as amended, established broad authority for the Government to respond to problems posed by releases or threats of release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.  Responsibilities under CERCLA include: Section 104, Response Authorities; and Section 105, National Contingency Plan.   CERCLA required the Federal Government to establish criteria for setting priorities among releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. EPA responded by developing the Hazard Ranking System (HRS), a scoring system which serves as the primary decision tool for determining which sites are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL).  The HRS evaluates four pathways of exposure: groundwater, surface water, soil exposure, and air.  For each pathway, the HRS evaluates: (1) the likelihood of release to the media, (2) characteristics of  waste (toxicity, quantity, etc.), and (3) targets (actual or potentially exposed receptors).  Sites that score 28.5 or greater are eligible for placement on the NPL. The NPL is EPA?s list of priority hazardous waste sites.  Sites on the NPL are eligible for Federal funding to perform remedial actions. 
After discovery, the site is evaluated by the Region with a preliminary assessment (PA).  A PA is an initial screening of the site in which all available data (e.g., past industrial activity, permit history, location of drinking water intakes) are collected and reviewed.  If warranted by the PA, a site inspection (SI) is conducted.  A SI involves on-site work that usually includes collection and analysis of suspected contaminated sources, soils, surface water, groundwater, and air samples.  In many instances, integrated assessments, which combine activities of the PA, SI, and removal assessment, are conducted at sites. If warranted by the SI, the site is formally evaluated for placement on the NPL. To determine an HRS score, all of the data gathered during the PA and SI stages are analyzed using the HRS.  Region 2 prepares the HRS packages (documentation record) which memorialize the Agency's rationale, data, scoring procedures, overall site score, and references, during the NPL listing process.  
The packages are submitted through the Region 2 EPA office to EPA Headquarters for a quality assurance/quality control review and analysis (QA/QC).  After QA/QC reviews are completed, sites with an HRS score of 28.5 or greater are eligible for proposal to the NPL.  For those sites determined to be appropriate for NPL listing, the HRS packages are placed in the Superfund docket for public review when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.
Placing sites on the NPL is a two-stage process.  First, sites are proposed to the NPL, and a 60-day comment period follows.  The public comments on proposed sites are evaluated for technical accuracy and policy issues, and detailed responses are prepared.  Second, following analysis and response to the public comments, sites still meeting the scoring criteria are placed on the NPL via a final rule.  After a final rule, a period of 90 days is allowed for the public commentors to file legal challenges to the Agency?s decision to place the sites on the final NPL.
The Region is responsible for discovering sites, evaluating their potential threat to human health and the environment, and implementing the HRS; EPA Headquarters is responsible for proposing and adding sites to the NPL, providing technical assistance in the event of litigation, and maintaining public information regarding these activities via the web and other data systems.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) acting on behalf of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Medgate Inc. for Medgate Occupational Health and Safety Software maintenance and Official Disability Guidelines License Renewal. The Government intends to award a contract for a base year and four option years.
<p>A sole source to Medgate Inc is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the manufacturer of the required software which is currently installed and in use. This software is the proprietary product of Medgate Inc. and cannot be maintained by any other vendor. Medgate is the only vendor with access to any of the necessary codes or documentation needed to provide maintenance and upgrades for this product. Also at this time there are no authorized resellers for the Medgate software.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Medgate Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The contract modification of Contract SPM75005D7426 is a sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems to extend contract coverage for the NSNs and PNs for the Up Armored HMMWV.  Listed below are the sole source FSCs which we propose to award a 90 day contract: 1005, 1010, 2040, 2510, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 3040, 3110, 3120, 3830, 3990, 4010, 4130, 4210, 4210, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5340, 5365, 5930, 5945, 5970, 5975, 5985, 6150, 7690, 9320, 9340, 9515 and 9905. The contract is for a period of 90 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on December 16, 2009 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on March 16, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

<p>TWO MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF HEPATITIS C OR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA FOLLOWING LIVING DONOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</p>
<p>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide therapeutic agents for studies to prevent recurrence of hepatitis C (HCV) and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: The Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation (A2ALL) Cohort Study's overall goal is to determine the outcomes of donors and recipients who choose LDLT (http://www.nih-a2all.org). Work by A2ALL investigators has resulted in a number of peer reviewed publications that serve as standards for the knowledge of LDLT in the United States, among which are papers on the health problems of donors and recipients as a result of transplantation; the survival advantage of LDLT among recipients, recipient mortality and the effect of transplant center experience; recurrence of viral hepatitis C after LDLT compared with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT); recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following LDLT and DDLT; severe psychiatric problems uncommonly experienced by living donors; resource utilization associated with DDLT and LDLT; and comparison of quality and accuracy of data collected by A2ALL to that of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. An extension of the study through 2014 will focus on surgical innovations in LDLT, long-term donor outcomes, and prevention of recurrence of HCV and HCC after LDLT.</p>
<p>A2ALL is now interested in conducting two additional clinical treatment studies, both among transplant recipients. One study would be to prevent recurrence of HCV through adjuvant treatment prior to or after transplantation. The other study would be to prevent recurrence of HCC through adjuvant treatment prior to or after transplantation, or both. The HCV and HCC studies would be separate and distinct, and patients would be eligible to participate in only one of the two studies.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Over the last 30 years liver transplantation has become the standard of care and the only cure for end stage liver disease. Its success has led to over 6,000 transplants performed yearly. But about 16,000 patients remain on the transplantation list awaiting deceased liver donation. LDLT constitutes a relatively small (fewer than 5% in 2009) but important portion of all adult liver transplants. Nevertheless, the high mortality and morbidity of patients waiting for transplant continues to put great pressure on consideration of alternatives to deceased liver donation. LDLT remains the main alternative for expanding the number of transplants. It has continued to evolve, with refinement of donor and recipient selection and improvement in outcomes. In response to the challenges surrounding live donor liver transplants, NIDDK established the A2ALL Network in 2002 and refunded it in 2009. The A2ALL Network is currently composed of a data coordinating center and nine clinical transplant centers throughout North America with expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, management, and conduct of clinical trials that have been charged with enrolling approximately 15-30 patients per center per year over a 4 year period.</p>
<p>One advantage of LDLT over DDLT is the ability to schedule the transplant procedure well in advance. In contrast, DDLT requires the availability and acceptance of a deceased liver donor offer only a few hours prior to transplantation. For pre- and peri-operative therapies, this advantage of LDLT is critically important. For example, protocols can be developed to provide treatment for a standard period of time that can be stopped at a certain time prior to transplant. For adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence of disease after transplantation, this ability to time the beginning and cessation of therapy in relationship to transplantation is extremely important.</p>
<p><br />STUDY GOALS: NIDDK through its A2ALL Network is interested in conducting two additional clinical treatment studies. One study would be for the prevention of recurrence of the HCV infection through treatment prior to or after transplantation using pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, in conjunction with HCV direct antiviral agents and/or natural products to determine if such therapy will clear HCV RNA from the blood in HCV-infected recipients and reduce the risk of recurrent HCV and allograft hepatitis. The other study would involve pre-transplant, peri-, and/or post-transplant treatment of HCC using pharmacologic therapies alone or in combination with locoregional ablative therapies to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: NIDDK is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with the A2ALL by providing 1) pegylated interferon, ribavirin, HCV direct antiviral agents, natural products with antiviral activity against HCV, and immunotherapy against HCV or 2) chemotherapies, and other pharmacological HCC inhibitors to be used in multi-center clinical studies for adult to adult LDLT.</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate. Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: The NIDDK will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in development of trials to prevent recurrence of HCV and HCC following LDLT. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information through their capability statements. A company may respond with capability statements for both studies. If a company wishes to respond to both the HCV and HCC opportunities, then separate and distinct Capability Statements are required. The Capability Statement should not exceed 12 pages of narrative and should address the criteria below. If necessary, supportive data should be provided as an attachment to the Capability Statement.</p>
<p>1. The proposed preparation must have been tested in clinical trials among patients with compensated cirrhosis or with more advanced liver disease.<br />2.

<CONTACT>Nicole Humphrey, Phone 2025644379, Email humphrey.nicole@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Transportation and Climate Division (TCD), in Washington DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to Purdue University, Sponsored Program Services, of West Lafayette, IN, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this purchase order is to acquire an analysis of the international land use impacts associated with an increase in biofuel demand using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The contractor will improve the existing GTAP framework by incorporating detailed renewable fuel data into a forward looking, spatially explicit, dynamic framework.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. It has been determined that Purdue University is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement, based on the following reasoning:</p>
<p>1) The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability/capabilities of understanding how changes in U.S. transportation fuel demand impacts world energy markets. Many of the policies TCD needs to analyze have not been well studied in the past, and may therefore require adding new capabilities, modify underlying assumptions, or updating with more recent information. Since extensive manipulation and interpretation of the modeling outputs may be required, the contractors must understand how the model was built and how it may be adjusted to meet TCD's needs. Dr. Thomas Hertel from Purdue University, the lead researcher for this effort, is uniquely qualified to complete this work for EPA. Dr. Hertel has developed extensive expertise in economy-wide analysis of trade and environmental policies including analysis of biofuel polices and mandates. He is Executive Director and founder of the Global Trade Analysis Project. Furthermore Dr. Hertel has experience examining and is an author on papers discussing the specific factors and parameters impacting land use change that EPA is interested in.</p>
<p>2) Dr. Hertel has been working for over ten years to develop the GTAP model and database and is recognized as an expert in the field. For these reasons, the Purdue team is uniquely qualified to undertake this requirement.</p>
<p>3) Market research reveals that no other contractor has the above-listed capabilities. No other contractor has been involved in every aspect of the design, build, and deployment of the GTAP model. Therefore, no other contractor has the expertise to interpret, modify, and customize the GTAP model to meet TCD's needs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Nicole Humphrey, Contracting Officer, to humphrey.nicole@epa.gov. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Nicole Humphrey, Contracting Officer, via e-mail to humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br />NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The purpose of this Modification 53 is to obligate $5,379.00 in funding in support of Work Assignment 2-203. The Period of Performance of WA 2-203 remains from May 20, 2010 through September 30, 2010. Work Assignment 2-203 is now funded to $98,524.00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-203 of Contract EP-C-05-046, the contractor supports EPA's assistance to Iowa and Kansas in its oversight of ARRA grant projects in order to ensure successful implementation of the ARRA requirements. The contractor will conduct site visits for 79 water projects (47 clean water and 32 drinking water) in Iowa and 45 water projects (22 clean water and 23 drinking water) in Kansas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>This is a special notice prepared in accordance FAR part 13 for a supply contract to repair/refurbish motors for trash racks installed at Dwyer Pump Station. This requirement is issued subject to the Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act.  This announcement provides the Government's intent to sole source these services to Infilco Degremont Inc. in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1)  The justification for sole source is provided below.  A copy of the written solicitation is available upon request.<BR><BR>RFP Reference #: W912P8-10-T-0178<BR><BR>This requirement shall be issued under NAICS Code is 333319 as a 100% set-aside to small business on a sole source basis to Infilco Degremont Inc, address listed below.  The SBA size standard is 500 employees.<BR><BR>Infilco Degremont Inc.  <BR>2924 Emerywood Pkwy<BR> Richmond, VA 23294<BR>.<BR>Summary Scope of Work (Remanufacturing / Refurbishing of Equipment):<BR><BR>The contractor shall repair motors on the Infilco Trash Racks (Climber Screen) Infilco Model IVS, Infilco Degremont Inc. Number 01100067 located at the Dwyer Pump Station.  The climber screen assembly consists of three climber screens with their frames tied together.  The total width of the assembly is 64 feet.  The Supplier shall remove the existing motors (six (6) motors) and have them refurbished and have heaters installed.  The gear reducers shall be properly sealed while motors are refurbished.  It is estimated turnaround time will be 3 to 4 weeks.  After completion of refurbishment, the motors shall be re-installed and have the missing limit switches installed and check out the controls.

Infilco Degremont Inc. manufactured the trash racks and they were installed by a separate contractor (builders of the pump station).  The trash racks have been damaged by Hurricane Katrina and are currently inoperable.  An inspection was done to insure operation of the racks; however, the racks did not function correctly.  As a result of the inspection, it has been determined that the first step in the repair of the trash racks is to insure the six (6) motors are working properly.  This will help determine what additional repairs are necessary to complete refurbishment of the inoperable equipment. Infilco's knowledge as the manufacturer of this proprietary equipment makes them the only source reasonably available to repair/refurbish this equipment to ensure the ultimate operability of the trash racks.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) - Soliciting from a Single Source, the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<BR><BR>Response Date for this Special Notice<BR>Interested small business firms who dispute this sole source solicitation must respond to this notice in writing NO LATER than December 7, 2010 @ 2:00PM CST to the POC listed below.

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p>Services: <br />&bull; Contractor needs to provide a minimum of 10year warranty on all parts that are being installed. The contractor shall have a service location site within a 50 mile radius of NMCP to be able to respond on-site within 2 hours of an initial service call if warranty work is required. Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) plenum rated twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing junction boxes (must properly drilled and sleeved so box can be closed and secured after installation), conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/EIA/TIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with RJ-45 angled modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to EIA/TIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a representative from the Network Team. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed. The removed cabling list will be provided to the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389). If cabling was removed through a firewall, all fire stopping must be replaced or filled-in in accordance National Electric Code (NEC).</p>
<p>Deliverables: <br />Contractor will provide site with complete test documentation as well as a cable running list (Appendix A). The cable running list will include building number, floor number, room number, drop number and drop location. Drop location is explained in Appendix B. If cable removal is applicable, vendor must provide a list of all data drop numbers removed to include room number it was removed from. (Appendix A). Contractor will also provide 2 CAT6 patch cables for each data drop installed. The cable at the patch panel will be 5ft in length and the other will be 15ft in length (the patch cables will be delivered to the Networking Office Bldg. 249 room 127).</p>
<p>**DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST ATTEND A "WALK THROUGH" TO EXAMINE WORK CONDITIONS AND EXISTING EQUIPMENT. BIDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FROM CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT ATTEND THE WALK THROUGH.**</p>

<DESC>Description:
GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. GSAs Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 04/08/10.  The solicitation is available electronically at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-F8-03-0056-B (include the dashes). Schedule 56, Buildings and Building Materials/Industrial Services and Supplies, includes the following programs: FSC 39, Warehouse Equipment and Supplies; FSC 46, Air & Water Purification and Sewer Treatment Equipment; FSC 49, Maintenance & Repair Shop Equipment; FSC 54, Pre-Engineered/Prefabricated Buildings and Structures; FSC 54, Above Ground Storage Tanks; FSC 56, Building Materials; FSC 61, Power Distribution Equipment; Generators, & Batteries; FSC 62, Solar Energy Systems & Lighting Products.  Schedule 56 actively solicits offers for alternative/renewable energy products and systems, energy efficient products, green products, such as green roof systems, and environmentally friendly products/services.  The solicitation consists of 16 files, including a basic solicitation and 6 product/service Attachments.  Offerors must complete and return the basic solicitation and all applicable product/service and pricing Attachments. All services, including SINs for Ancillary Repair and Alteration, must be priced IAW the Services Pricing Proposal, Attachment 10.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative and the addition of SIN 056 01  Smart Building Systems Integrator.  The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation.  FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. The scope of the Smart Buildings Systems Integrator SIN primarily covers consulting for the integration of building systems such as security, heating and cooling systems, building safety systems, phone systems, etc.  While this integration may include some IT interfaces, equipment and software, this would be ancillary to the majority of this work which entails consulting for the integration of building systems .Paper offers will no longer be accepted for this schedule.  The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years.

Any overtime rates will be negotiated in advance.</p>
<p>Work Required To Be Performed At Night. Any night or differential rates will be negotiated in advance of issuing individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>In the event performance of a task requires non-exempt employees to work in excess of an "established" normal workweek (usually 40 hours), thereby making the contracted employee eligible for overtime the Health and Welfare benefits will not be applied in calculating the loaded hourly rate. The overtime premium shall be computed in accordance with the Service Contract Act.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall bill for overtime hours based on an overtime markup percentage that results in the recovery only of FICA, FUTA, SUTA and Workman's Compensation costs for the overtime portion of the payment. This means that, for one hour of overtime, the Contractor shall recover costs in the same amount for their percentage markup as the Contractor would receive for any base hour at a straight time rate.</p>
<p>In conditions where work is required on a Federal holiday (such as a federal facility that is open on holidays), the Contractor shall pay its Service Contract Act applicable employees who work on the holiday regular pay for the hours worked on the holiday plus holiday pay in accordance with the Service Contract Act.</p>
<p>Liability for a Contractor employee's vacation is the responsibility of the Contractor by whom the person is employed at the time the contracted employee becomes eligible for vacation, i.e., the employee's anniversary date of employment (this could include time spent on a predecessor contract as well as time spent under the current contract). (See DOL Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Labor Standards for Federal Service Contracts, Part 4).</p>
<p>Since all costs associated with vacations and holidays are the exclusive responsibility of the Contractor; the Contractor's markup percentage must include these costs. The only exception to this requirement would be if a specific statement were included in the wage determination, which makes an exception to the general rule.</p>
<p>INSURANCE<br />The Contractor shall procure and maintain the following minimum insurance coverage during the period of<br />performance of this contract in accordance with FAR 52.228-5, Insurance - Work on a Government Facility:<br />$500,000 per accident for bodily injury;<br />No property damage general liability insurance is required.<br />Automobile Insurance (comprehensive form of policy) is required:<br />$200,000 per person; and<br />$500,000 per accident for bodily injury; and $20,000 per accident for property damage.<br />Standard Workmen's Compensation and employer's Liability Insurance. A minimum amount of $100,000 is required under the contract.<br />Prior to contract commencement, the Contractor shall furnish to the CO a certificate or written statement<br />certifying compliance with the above required insurance coverage. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the interests of the Government shall not be effective for such a period as the laws of the State of New York which this contract is to be performed prescribe, or until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the CO, whichever period is longer.<br />SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL<br />The Contractor, his employees, and his subcontractors are subject to, and shall abide by and comply with, all relevant statutes, ordinances, laws and regulations of the United States (including Executive Orders of the President) and any State (or other public authority now or hereafter in force).

The unilateral act of any Governmental body against any employee of the Contractor for the violation of a state or federal law or regulation shall not excuse the Contractor from full compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract.</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHA) Standards, technical orders, regulations, and referenced publications. The contractor shall comply with the highest degree of safety protection where any disagreements exist.</p>
<p>Accident prevention and safety practices on contractual work under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Officer are the responsibilities of the contractor concerned. The Contractor shall brief all employees on proper safety and accident reporting. The Contractor shall provide all occupational health services to his employees. Contractor employees shall be instructed to notify the Contractor's contract manager of potential or existing occupational health hazards that require attention.</p>
<p>The Contractor hereby agrees to release the Government (to include its officer, enlisted personnel, agents, and employees) from any liability for any loss, damage, or injury sustained by the Contractor or his employees during the performance of this contract. The Contractor also agrees to indemnify the Government for any loss, damage, or injury to Government personnel or agents or other third parties, provided such loss to the Government is caused by the negligence of the Contractor or his personnel while performing this contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.1 This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-300016 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only. The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set aside. This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued for a firm-fixed-price for the overhaul of USCG C130 Fuel Level Valve, Part Number 7-716835, NSN 2915-00-739-3047. The quantity is 22 each. Overhauls are to be performed in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 6J15-3-103-3.
<p>This material has been identified as "FLIGHT CRITICAL" and a Certificate of Airworthiness is required. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a DOD Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offeror's proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Desired delivery date is 45 days after receipt of order. Earlier deliveries are acceptable at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. Inspection shall be performed at destination by USCG, ALC Quality Assurance Personnel and Acceptance shall be determined by the Certification of Airworthiness for each item delivered. Items shipped shall be shipped to: USCG Aircraft Logistics Center, Attn: Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001. FOB destination is preferred. Vendors using FOB Origin shall include shipping costs with their quotations. Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container. Packaging of the items for shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor's best commercial practices with the following exceptions: Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton, or crate. Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with NSN, Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Purchase Order Number, and Line Item. Only Bar Coding of the NSN is necessary. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage. Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component. Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452. The evaluation factor for award of this requirement will be based on lowest price obtained from a responsible offeror that can meet the required delivery schedule. Contractor's past performance on prior U.S. Coast Guard requirements will be considered before award. Point of Contact is Mr. William Creef, 252-335-6640 or William.D.Creef@uscg.mil.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability</p>
<p>Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are PASS/FAIL criteria. Only offerors meeting all of these criteria will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to meet or exceed the power supply specification stated in the performance specification document attached to this solicitation. Each offeror must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance.</p>
<p>A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror shall include within each quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Offerors that have obtained a PASS rating on the technical criteria listed above will then be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Price<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)</p>
<p>Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirement listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. All offerors must comply with the requirements in section (b) of FAR 52-215-20 found below.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information in accordance with the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past three (3) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (OCT 2010)</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>

<p>(b). Provide information described below:</p>
<p>1. Explain the differences between the offered price, the established catalog price, and the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />2. Describe the nature of the relevant market and how that market affects the offered price including the source and date or period of any relevant market quotation or other basis for market price, the base market price, and applicable discounts or other price adjustments.<br />3.

Provide what constitutes the normal order size for firms paying prices and document whether or not there is a discount for larger quantities ordered.<br />5. Provide the sales volume to similar customers and the prices paid by those customers.<br />6. Provide documentation of the lowest prices recently charged to other customers for the same or similar products.<br />7. Provide an explanation if the offeror cannot, at a minimum, meet the Government's required delivery date.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p><br />All quotations submitted by responsible sources shall be considered by the Agency, if received timely. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 15 December 2010, 4:00 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 17 December 2010. E-mail quotes and facsimile quotes are acceptable. E-mail quotes may be sent to claudette.y.surrento@uscg.mil or forwarded via to: fax number 252-334-5242 Attn: Claudette Y. Surrento.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-Q-P45B84 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers- 30 December 2010<br />Aluminum Pallets- Solicitation FA8601-11-T-0034
<p>1. QUESTION: How can I obtain the SOW?<br />ANSWER: The only specifications are those listed in the solicitation. The critical requirement is that the pallets can support 6,000 lbs. You are welcome to propose what you think will work best for the USAF Museum. Please remember that the proposal will be evaluated on price. The offeror with the lowest price/technically acceptable will win the award.<br />2. QUESTION: Are there any drawings or blueprints available? Can you give the thickness of the top plate and slats?<br />ANSWER: There are not any drawings (see response above). There is not a specification for the thickness of the top plate and slats. The height of the pallet should be 6"; the weight capacity is 6,000 lbs. <br />3. QUESTION: What dimensional tolerances are permitted on the length, width, &amp; especially the height? In particular referencing the height, a pallet could be constructed using stringers made from standard shapes of 6-inch width with sheathing attached on either side thus making an overall thickness in excess of 6-inches by two times the sheathing thickness.<br />ANSWER: You are limited to only the specifications listed in the solicitation. <br />4. QUESTION: Are the loads placed upon the pallets distributed evenly and uniformly across the total surface of the pallets? If not, how and where are the loads applied and distributed?<br />ANSWER: The loads are not necessarily evenly distributed on the pallet. The manner of distribution is unknown at this time.<br />5. QUESTION: What percentage of the slatted pallet surfaces is open space? Are the top &amp; bottom surfaces to be the same?<br />ANSWER: The top and bottom surfaces should be identical. There is not a percentage requirement for the slatted/open surface area.<br />6. QUESTION: Are we correct to assume that by "solid pallets" it is meant that the top surface is to be a continuous plate with no openings? If so, shall the bottom surface be the same?<br />ANSWER: Yes, the term solid in "solid pallets" means a continuous plate with no openings. Yes, the bottom surface should be identical to the top surface.<br />7. QUESTION: Regarding the openings for "Two-Way Entry", are we correct to assume that the two entry sides are opposite one another?<br />ANSWER: The "entries" in the "two-way entry" should be opposite each other in order to allow the use of a forklift.<br />8. QUESTION: Are there any prints available for this request and how many times a year would orders be placed for these pallets?<br />ANSWER: There are not any prints available. This is a onetime order.<br />9. QUESTION: What is the required delivery date?<br />ANSWER: The pallets will be delivered by June, 2011.<br />10. QUESTION: Is there a Brand preference for these pallets? No</p>

<DESC>TO VIEW THE COMPLETE COPY OF THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION (including AMENDMENTS), please go to the AQD website http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/ (and select Business Community, Solicitations, Open Market Solicitations) or copy and paste the following link: http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/Business/openmarket.aspxThe Solicitation, Amendments, and any attachments can be found by selecting the Solicitation number: D11PS18805.
Amendment 2: Government response to questions posed by potential offerors regarding this RFQ/Solicitation.
1.  The RFQ/Solicitation states, "NAICS Code 524298 entitled, "All Other Insurance Related Activities," with a $7 million size standard threshold applies to this acquisition."   Does this mean that the vendor with that NAIC S code must have that size standard threshold in order to quote on this requirement?  
Answer:  No, this is not a small business set-aside.  FAR Part 19.303 states that the contracting officer must determine and include the NAICS code and small business size standard on all solicitations above the micro purchase threshold.  
2.  Had RMA intended this project be specific to the cotton growing regions of Texas or to all cotton growing regions of the United States? 
Answer:  It is not the intent of the Government for this project to be specific to the cotton growing regions of Texas, but to the applicable cotton growing areas determined by the contractor's research.  If this turns out to be the cotton growing regions of Texas, based on the contractor's research, this is fine.
3.  Should the offer contain a price proposal based on the assumption that all five task orders may ultimately be carried out or should the offer contain a price proposal based solely on the completion of Task Order #1? Answer:  The ID/IQ Price Quotation should only have a breakdown of labor categories and hourly rates for each period quoted (base and each option period), to be utilized on task order 1 and future task orders.  Task order 1 should be price as a firm fixed quotation (to include labor mix and hours), in accordance with the labor rates and labor categories stated in the ID/IQ price quotation for the base period.  Prices quotations for possible future task orders are not required at this point.

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC>The contract modification of Contract SPM75005D7426 is a sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems to extend contract coverage for the NSNs and PNs for the Up Armored HMMWV.  Listed below are the sole source FSCs which we propose to award a 181 day contract: 1005, 1010, 2040, 2510, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 3040, 3110, 3120, 3830, 3990, 4010, 4130, 4210, 4210, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5340, 5365, 5930, 5945, 5970, 5975, 5985, 6150, 7690, 9320, 9340, 9515 and 9905. The contract is for a period of 181 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on March 16, 2010 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on September 13, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

The current contract will expire on September 13, 2010 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on&nbsp;December 13, 2010. There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet. These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA. The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%. With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Government&rsquo;s best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems. If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a suite of product development services. While the overall suite of services is comprehensive, the intent is to provide individual services on a case-by-case basis for a diverse collection of biopharmaceutical product candidates, rather than carry a single product candidate through an entire preclinical development pathway. These services have helped a wide variety of investigators in a number of scientific areas obtain critical data needed to acquire additional funding, gain prospective partnerships (either for further development or to support Phase I trials), fulfill regulatory requirements, and complete studies needed to apply for an IND and enter a Phase I trial.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to study control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents (except HIV). Support for basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics is provided through a variety of research grants and contracts. DMID also supports an array of research resources and services to assist investigators, including programs that provide or make available genomic data and technologies; organisms and state-of-the-art reagents; biocontainment facilities; and preclinical and clinical translational research services. (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid).</p>
<p>The development and introduction of new therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as infectious diseases prevalent in resource-limited countries remain a high public health priority. To assist in filling these public health gaps, the NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive, and product development-oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising biopharmaceutical therapeutic candidates that emerge from academia, the private sector, or other sources. The suite of services will encompass those activities commonly associated with the development of biopharmaceutical products for infectious disease required for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and/or Biologic License Application (BLA). Consequently, DMID recognizes that to obtain the full spectrum of expertise or facilities required to perform all activities set forth in this solicitation, individual organizations will likely need the expertise and resources of other organizations or persons through consortia agreements, partnerships, subcontracts, and/or consultants. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed and shall be responsible for project planning, initiation, implementation, management and communication; evaluation, selection, and management of subcontractors; and for all deliverables specified in this contract and each awarded Task Order.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The Contractor shall provide DMID with a broad and flexible range of non-traditional, proactive and development-oriented capabilities to provide preclinical development support for promising biopharmaceutical products when such products emerge from investigator-initiated research studies or other sources identified by DMID Program staff. These capabilities will allow DMID to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps. The Contractor shall assist DMID staff in providing all support and appropriate documentation needed for preclinical activities to support IND submissions for Phase I and II clinical testing, or Biologic License Applications (BLAs) for advanced products. Specific Task Orders will depend on the status of the candidate(s) as part of an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. DMID will issue a Task Order Request for Proposal after determination of a specific need that is appropriate to the Statement of Work. The Contractor shall be prepared to develop a response in which the Contractor specifies the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each Task Order and the associated costs. The needs, funding, product maturity and timelines of the product as specified in the Task Order establishes requirements for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) [21 CFR Parts -11, -210, -211, -600].</p>
<p>The following definitions will apply: Biopharmaceutical Products - Materials that are derived from biotechnology processes including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies and derivatives of monoclonal antibodies; recombinant proteins; peptides; nucleic acid based vectors (siRNA, plasmids); and live, modified-live and/or attenuated entities; Therapeutic - A product intended for use in the cure, mitigation or treatment of disease caused by a pathogen or certain toxins, e.g., botulinum toxin.</p>
<p>The services shall be directed at the following: 1) diseases caused by pathogens and toxins on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list; 2) emerging and re emerging infectious diseases; 3) antimicrobial resistant and multi drug resistant infections; 4) other bacterial infections; 5) fungal infections; 6) viral infections; and 7) parasitic diseases.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to carry out the Scope and Activities defined in the following six Task Areas:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative, Management and Technical Support: One Task Order will be assigned under this Task Area. The Task Order will be a cost-reimbursement, term (level of effort) type contract with a Base Period of 12 months and multiple Options to extend the Base Period of Performance in 12-month increments up to a total of 10 years to continue the same requirement. The contractor is REQUIRED to provide a total level of effort of 1824 total direct labor hours per year based on a Work Year of 1920 productive work hours (excluding vacation, holiday, sick leave) for a period of performance of 10 years (Base period plus nine, one-year Options). The scope of this Task Area's activities includes the ability to facilitate ad hoc meetings and provide ad hoc reporting as part of general administrative, management, and technical support activities that are not Task Order specific.<br /><br />(2) Feasibility Assessments and Audits: The scope of Task Area 2 includes assessing and advising via documented communications (e.g., reports) on products for feasibility of design, development, manufacture, assay development and stability for the development of Phase I and II clinical trial materials; developing and writing Preclinical and/or Product Development Plans for specified products; and conducting, reviewing and evaluating audits of potential vendors. Audit types include technical and/or facilities audits. The estimate of effort for this task area is 442 hours per feasibility assessment and 154 hours per audit.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:

* Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
* Compensation and Pension (C&P)
* Education
* Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
* Insurance
* Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task order proposal requests (TOPRs) against this IDIQ contract. Each TOPR will be evaluated based on a price proposal, past performance information and a technical/management plan, then a TO will be subsequently awarded to the ID/IQ Contractor whose TOPR proposal provides best value to the Government.  Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided in the solicitation. TOPRs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about December 10, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about December 27, 2010.

<DESC>This contract is intended to provide high quality, Continuing Legal Education CLE eligible, litigation skills and litigation ethics training to attorneys in the Navy Office of the General Counsel. Task orders describing the specific training to be provided will be issued. The training included in this contract shall include principally web-based archived, web-based live, and live in-person training; however, the development and preparation of other high quality training materials will be required.  The attorneys who will receive this training will be at different levels of litigation experience and skills and are responsible for representing the Navy in predominantly administrative forums such as the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, Merit Systems Protection Board, and EEOC as well as in federal courts assisting DOJ attorneys.
  The Navy Office of the General Counsel handles cases in a wide variety of areas and forums including, but not limited to, government contracts at the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, Court of Federal Claims, General Accounting Office and Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, civil False Claims Act cases in the Federal District Courts, civilian personnel cases at the Merit Systems Protection Board and in Federal Courts, EEO discrimination cases in Federal District Court and before the EEOC, Class Actions in federal courts, and environmental cases in Federal and State courts. The training and training materials to be provided under this contract shall cover all aspects of case preparation, legal writing, discovery, electronic discovery,
trial, negotiations and settlement, and appeals from both an offensive and defensive standpoint and should be heavily geared towards the practical as opposed to the theoretical.
 The ethical obligations facing government attorneys in litigation should be covered and stressed in all training. The training materials for non-attorneys may cover trial practice, discovery obligations, the duty of confidentiality, depositions and trial testimony, and the ethical obligations of counsel for the government and is designed to make certain that clients involved in litigation understand both the litigation process and their role in that process.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
As required by FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Procure emergency services for the repair of fifteen (15) flexible endoscopes in addition to various other surgical instruments from Instrumedics, LLC.   
		    
3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  Jesse Brown VAMC requested the urgent repair of fifteen (15) flexible endoscopes in addition to various other surgical instruments used at the facility.  The equipment is in dire need of repair and cannot be used for patient procedures.  The Jesse Brown VAMC is in a critical shortage of operable endoscopes in order to meet patient diagnosis and treatment needs.  The approximate cost is $45,900.00.
  
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  The VA's need for the supply is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:   The facility requires equipment which will allow them to provide safe, advanced and appropriate patient care to the veteran population.  Based upon information provided by the service, the emergency repair of the scopes is required.  The endoscopes are highly advanced allowing the Jesse Brown VAMC to detect lesions and treat them.  The lack of endoscopes create unacceptable delays and cancelations from providing proper care which is creating the possibility of life threatening situations for critically ill patients in the diagnoses of disease progression.  


6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center conducted research and concluded there were no potential sources that had a GSA or FSS contract.  This is an urgent request so no other offers were solicited.        

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was confirmed with COTR on past purchases for the same or similar type equipment and is comparable.  

8.	Market survey conducted:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center researched GSA and FSS for vendors, but none were found.  Since this is an emergency request, no further market research was conducted.   

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  In the future, the station should plan and ensure a sufficient supply of scopes to meet patient care needs and enact procedures to protect instruments that were damaged.         

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Based upon information received from the station, we concur that it is in the best interest of the government to proceed with the emergency procurement with this firm.
