<SUBJECT>B--Year 2005 Gulfwide Emission Inventory Study
<SOLNBR>0104RP33295
<ARCHDATE>01302005
<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to generate an air emissions inventory and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from parties interested in proposing on this requirement.   The Title of this study is "Year 2005 Gulfwide Emission Inventory Study".  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursable-type contract for service. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The study would generate a 2005 air emissions inventory of criteria pollutants- carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter-10 (PM10), particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), all VOC including exempted compounds (40CFR51.100), as well as greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), for all sources in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  These emissions data are needed to support ozone and regional haze modeling efforts promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their more stringent ambient air quality standards for ozone and new regulations for regional haze.  Specific objectives of this study are to provide support services and to recommend any modifications of the Gulfwide Offshore Activities Data System- Version 1 (GOADS-1) and the Database Management Software- Version 1 (DBMS-1), to collect, describe, quality control, and archive 2005 activity data from platform and non-platform sources on the OCS, and to calculate and archive emissions data for calendar year 2005.  Activity data from all equipment sources must be collected from all major platforms on the OCS using GOADS-1.  Surveys will have to be performed to gather activity data from non-platform sources, such as support vessels and helicopters.  In addition, estimates shall be made of emissions from commercial shipping, tanker lightering, commercial fisheries, geogenic/biogenic sources, and other emission sources on the OCS.  By using DBMS-1 software, the 2005 activity data and appropriate emissions factors are multiplied to obtain total emissions.  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality of the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, oil production platform equipment, non-platform air emissions sources on the OCS, conducting air emissions inventories, and EPA regulations and submittal procedures.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of Visual Basic, Windows and Oracle are needed to support the existing software used to gather platform activity data (GOADS-1) and calculate the total emissions (DBMS-1).  This knowledge should include programming to revise the existing software if necessary, plus understanding the programming languages and software to perform the necessary actions to calculate the high quality emission inventory.  A description of an on-going emission inventory study sponsored by MMS can be found on the following web page:  "Gulfwide Emissions Inventory Study for the Regional Haze and Ozone Modeling Efforts" (GM-99-08) at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/ongoing_studies/gom-as.html.

Govworks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Telemedicine Directorate, Washington, DC.  The medical center has a requirement for one (1) Brachial Plexus Peripheral Nerve Block Simulator/Training System.  This equipment will be sent to the Uniformed Services University for Health Sciences (USUHS) in Bethesda, MD  The Brachial System will be used for the Regional Anesthesia Distance Learning Project.  Physicians are reluctant to use opiod-based medications to manage pain for ambulatory surgery because of its side effects.  Two techniques that offer a solution to part of the problem are long acting peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) and outpatient continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNB).  The Army Regional Anesthesia Initiative at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) has as its principle goal the continued development of this anesthesia technique in the management of acute pain in our patients at home and on the battlefield.  Expertise in these unique anesthetic techniques is concentrated in the WRAMC Anesthesiology faculty with the Army's only fellowship trained regional anesthesiologis directing.  Using a regional anesthesia patient simulator, WRAMC regional anesthesiologists will guide students and residents through the PMB and CPNB Techniques.  This state-of-the-art technology will provide Regional Anesthesia trainers with the capability to monitor student progress from a distance and to ensure that students perfect these techniques before using them on real patients.  The Medical Technology Systems, Inc. system provides a breakthrough in nerve block simulation.   Description of this equipment is as follows:  Realistic quarter body Brachial Plexus model with axillary pulse and major nerve structures; one (1) modular PC Interface, parellel port cables and power supply; one (1) Multi-positional external Flat 15" screen monitor; one (1) Software Version 1.1 (provides multiple block approaches); Twelve (12) months Technical support and Software upgrades; Twelve (12) months Preventive Maintenance Package; Twelve (12) months System upgradesThe intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.
