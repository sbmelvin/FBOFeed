POC Mr. Hugo Wagner Falck, Chief Engineer of the Directorate of Major Infrastructure of the Honduran Social Investment Fund (DIM/FHIS), Tel: 011-504-234-5157/233-1762, e-mail: dimfhis@yahoo.com, Fax: To be requested by phone. The Government of Honduras acting through The Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS) with financial assistance from the United States Agency for INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Mission in Honduras, invites US and Honduran Firms to participate in the bidding process DIM/FHIS 002-2002 for the construction of the water system for the Municipality of Santa Rosa de Cop?n (Component II). Interested firms must be able to provide Spanish speaking personnel since all documentation is in the Spanish language. This bid is part of the Honduran Government's Program to implement permanent repairs and expansions to the water and sanitation infrastructure.

<DESC>The Space Based Laser Project Office is inviting research responses focused on defining an "airborne" testbed to perform a mid-course active tracking experiment.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $400K.  SMC intends to make multiple awards, as such; each proposal may not exceed $200K in cost for a six-month period of performance.  The experiment is intended to demonstrate mid-course Acquisition, Tracking and Pointing (ATP), to include Active Fine Track, for the FY06 Missile Defense Agency (MDA) testbed.  Primary emphasis for the "airborne" mid-course active tracking experiment should be placed on platform selection for the FY06 experiment (e.g. Aircraft, Balloon, etc.), fundamental sizing of the problem (e.g. operating altitude, range, aperture illuminator power, etc.), evaluation of the current state-of-the-art technology to meet the proposed mission, definition of potential problems and requirements, conceptual design, and program plan to build, integrate, and conduct the experiment in the FY06 timeframe.  This study must result in the definition of an experiment and technology developments that constitute a good first step on a path that will support the overall MDA system of systems architecture, with the role of lasers (in and through space) changing as their capabilities (and those of other systems in the architecture) change over time in a spiral development and evolutionary acquisition cycle (crawl, walk, run). The overarching goal is to sufficiently define a technically sound and executable experiment in sufficient detail that the offeror can make meaningful estimates for cost/budget, schedule, milestones, support requirements, and traceability to an operational capability.  This ATP experiment definition study will guide the planning and budgeting for near term ATP technology development investments by the SBL Project Management Office.  We anticipate that a subsequent competitive procurement will address the design, build, integration, and conduct of the ATP experiment defined in this study.   Proposals are due not later than 9 Jul 2002, 2:00 pm (Pacific Daylight Time).  Proposals shall be submitted to SMC/TLK, Attn:  Paula Bryant, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467-80, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) intends to increase the total maximum limitation of GSA Contract Number GS00T00NSD0004 from $65.173 million to $145.108 million as a result of a greater level of support efforts required by GSA Federal Technology Services and its customer agencies than originally anticipated.  However, if the results of this market survey indicate there are at least 2 or more potential qualified sources who can support this proposed increased requirement, the Government will consider release of a competitive requirement.  This is a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that was awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253C(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to Mitretek Systems, Incorporate, Center for Telecommunications and Advanced Technology, 3150 Fairview Park Road South, Falls Church, Virginia, a non-profit, conflict-free organization, for telecommunications advisory and assistance services.  The base contract period of performance is for one year with four option years.  The contract, awarded January 1, 2000, is currently in its third year of operation.  Under this contract, Mitretek currently provides continuous support to GSA and its customer agencies in the definition, analysis, acquisition, evolution, and independent and objective evaluation of telecommunications services and systems in support of GSA's current FTS2001, Metropolitan Area Acquisition (MAA), associated niche contract programs, the successor inter/intracity telecommunications acquisition environment, and the development of overall Federal Government telecommunications services strategic concepts, and their interfaces with other GSA and Federal Government telecommunications efforts.  The nature of the work being performed requires freedom from actual or potential conflict of interest (no direct or indirect association with firms in the telecommunications industry), knowledge in the field of telecommunications and in government/GSA telecommunications services and systems, no engagement in any business activity which could make the Contractor appear unsuitable for having access to GSA's or other government entities' plans, standards, methodologies, acquisition information, and vendor proprietary information.  This requirement has been limited to those functions that require the services of a non-profit, conflict-free organization that possesses unique telecommunications capabilities.  This contract includes a requirement that the Contractor shall be prohibited from participating in competition as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant for the Government of any items and/or services to be furnished and other contracts based on any work performed under this contract.  The term "Contractor" includes Contractor personnel, subcontractors, and consultants.  All Contractor personnel shall be considered procurement officials and will be subject to the provisions of Section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41.U.S.C.423).  Interested Contractors are invited to identify their interest and technical capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days following the date of publication of this notice.  Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities, conflict free credentials, and unbiased status.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Send written responses to Elaine Bryant, GSA, Contract Management and Administration Branch, TQN, 10304 Eaton Place, Fairfax, VA  22030-2213.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.*****

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12, Part 13, and Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification Systems Code is 721110 and the small business standard is $6.0 million.  The Volpe Center requires temporary housing to relocate residents of Libby Montana who will be effected by the removal of Zonolite attic insulation and large quantities o f soil removed from their properties, which may pose a health risk if they remain on their property during the removal process.  The Volpe Center requires interested bidders to reserve blocks of 10 to 20 rooms (five (5) singles and five (5) doubles) for periods of five nights to three weeks from June 1, through December 31, 2002.  The government will notify the hotel by 11:00 a.m. M.T., of the actual number of rooms required for that day.  The government reserves the right to make multiple awards.  All bidders must meet the Government standards for temporary housing, i.e., Section 24.2(f) of the Uniform Regulations at CFR Part 24 entitled Replacement Housing Standards/Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Standards and Comparable Replacement Housing.  Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Standards means the dw elling must meet applicable housing and occupancy codes.  However, any of the following standards, which are not met by an applicable code, shall apply unless waived for good cause by the Federal agency funding the project.  The dwelling shall:  1) be structurally sound, weather tight, and in good repair; 2) contain a safe electrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices; 3) contain a heating system capable of sustaining healthful temperature of approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit for a displaced person, except in those areas where local climatic conditions do not require such a system; 4) be adequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space needed to accommodate the displaced person.  There shall be a separate, well lighted and ventilated bathro om that provides privacy to the user and contains a sink, bathtub or shower stall, and a toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to the appropriate sources of water and to a sewage drainage system.  In the case of a housekeeping dwelling, there shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage drainage system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and a refrigerator; 5) contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level.  If the replacement dwelling unit is on the second story or above, with access directly from or through a common corridor, the common corridor must have at least two means of egress; and 6) for displaced person who is handicapped, be free of any  barriers, which would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the dwelling by such displaced person.   Comparable Replacement Housing means a dwelling must be: 1) decent, safe, and sanitary; 2) functionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling.  The term functionally equivalent means that it performs the same function, provides the same utility, and is capable of contributing to a very comparable style of living.  While a comparable replacement dwelling need not posses every feature of the displacement dwelling, the principal features must be present.  Generally, functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range of purposes for which the various physical features of a dwelling may be used.  However, in determining whether a replacement dwelling is functionally  equivalent to the displacement dwelling, the Agency may consider reasonable tradeoffs for specific features when the replacement unit is equal to or better then the displacement dwelling; 3) adequate in size to accommodate the occupants; 4) in an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions; 5) in location generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced person’s dwelling with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities, and reasonably accessible to the person’s place of employment; 6) on a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements, including customary landscaping.  The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, swimming pools, or greenhouses; 7) currently available  to the displaced person on the private market.  However, a comparable replacement dwelling for a person receiving government housing assistance before displacement may reflect similar government housing assistance; and 8) within the financial means of the displaced person.  All bidders must also have establishments equal to a AAA approval rating of two diamonds.  Bidders must also be located within Libby Montana.  In addition to their bid, Bidders must submit documentation that states they meet all government criteria.  Bidders shall submit pricing equal to or below the government per diem rate of $55.30 for Lincoln County, Montana for the following various accommodations, CLIN 0001, summer rate, 1 bed, 1 person; CLIN 0001AA, winter rate 1 bed, 1 person; CLIN 0002, summer rate 1 bed, 2 peo ple; CLIN 0002AA winter rate 1 bed, 2 people; CLIN 0003, summer rate, 2 beds, 2 people; CLIN 0003 winter rate, 2 beds, 2 people; CLIN 0004, summer rate, 2 beds, 3+ people, CLIN 0004AA winter rate, 2 beds, 3+ people.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors – Commercial, is hereby incorporated by reference.  All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with their offer.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on 1 October 2002. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 14 Jun 02. The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($18 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 1 Sep 02, with a performance start date of 1 Oct 02.The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  
Electrosynthesis methods for controlling the morphology of nanostructures have been developed at PNNL and are available for license.  The methods are capable of producing arrays of oriented nanofibers and nanofilms that maybe useful in a wide variety of applications, including sensors, electronic displays, fuel cells and advanced batteries.  The methods are particularly applicable to the production of conducting polymers, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods.  In addition to synthesis of the nanofiber materials, the methods include techniques for introducing additional substances into the nanofiber array structure.  For example, inorganic substances may be introduced into the pores in the nanofiber film to enhance its electrical properties.  The templateless, liquid phase processing method developed at PNNL can be used to synthesize a wide variety of nanomaterials.  The synthesis method has been used to produce iron (III) hexacyanoferrate-modified electrodes that were subsequently used in the construction of sensors. One such sensor demonstrated the ability to accurately detect hydrogen peroxide at low voltage potentials from about 0.2 to  ?0.2 V, which substantially eliminated interference from other components in the analyte sample.
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of Eric Lund, PO Box 999-MISIN K9-89, Richland WA 99352 or (509) 375-3764.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce intends to award a small business set-aside contract for the Bureau of Export Administration.  It is anticipated that this requirement will  result in either a single award or multiple awards with each having a base period of 12-months with four (4) 12-month option periods. The services are hereby described below:

The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) the Baltic States, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems.  The BXA/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with the export control organizations in these countries since 1994.  The level and scope of NEC's outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems.

The NEC requires specialized support in the following areas: training development; training delivery and deployment; management of export control exchanges, workshops, seminars, conferences; management of deployments of specialized export control systems and tools with Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and other activities as assigned.  

The Contractor will assist to identify training modules to develop in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries.  These modules will augment the existing NEC training material which has been established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum.  New modules containing various levels of detail will have to be developed in the following areas: legal and regulatory development; licensing practices and control lists; industry-government relations; export enforcement, and export control management information systems.  Previously developed training material will be reviewed and modified based on changes in export control laws, regulations, and policies and new requirements.  

The Contractor shall possess the capabilities to deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in  cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g.  legal and regulatory development; licensing practices and control lists; industry-government relations; export enforcement, and export control management information systems).  These courses usually are delivered in the NEC TIC facility to bilateral and multilateral delegations.  At times, the Contractor may be required to deliver training in the form of workshops, seminars, and conferences in foreign locations.  For training activities in foreign locations, the Contractor is required to make independent travel, hotel, visa and all other logistical arrangements.

For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor will be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other USG agencies and U.S. industry.

It is anticipated that the Solicitation will be released on or about January 4, 2002.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on a full and open competitive basis services required to provide engineering support to the United States Joint Forces Command (US JFCOM) , Suffolk, VA for the specialized development, administration, and maintenance of an existing Definity G3r V9 telephone switch with INTUITY Audix voice mail and an Emerald call accounting system.   The mission of JFCOM is to provide a training environment where Joint Task Force Commanders can learn to develop and implement joint force doctrine, tactics, and procedures in a realistic facility, using computer-simulated scenarios instead of actual troop deployment.   JFCOM supports Mission Integration and Rehearsals for assigned forces, where tactics and procedures are developed and practiced in the event of a real-world crisis.   These military exercises require expedient and ongoing reconfiguration and reprogramming of the Definity system to adapt to building populations that can vary from less than 1,000 to nearly 3,000 in a matter of days.   During an exercise, telephone system reconfiguration takes place on a continuous, often minute-to-minute basis, as mandated by conditions of the exercise and orders from the Joint Task Force Commander.   The system includes the secure transmission of voice and data and must interface with a variety of analog and digital commercial, strategic, and tactical telecommunications systems, video teleconferencing circuits, and foreign systems and circuits belonging to allied nations.   Interfaces of the JFCOM Definity system with modeling and simulation systems must be reengineered as the model/simulation evolves.   Similar engineering is required to interface the Definity system with  telecommunications systems of allied countries such as the Partnership for Peace Simulation Network (PFPSN) to distribute voice communications to U. S. and European sites using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP), Voice Over Frame Relay (VOFR), or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).   The JFCOM Definity system undergoes continuous reengineering to meet new mission requirements.   This includes redesign of the JFCOM cable plant , dial plan, and system software in support of new lab spaces and existing test bays.   The system is a unique state-of-the-art telecommunications architecture, unlike any currently existing in the Department of Defense.   The requirement is for twelve months of services, commencing 1 October 2002, with four option years.   The award of a firm fixed price contract is anticipated.   Offerors shall be required to submit price and technical proposals.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard are 513390 and $12.5M, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia.   The resultant solicitation, when issued, will be made available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil .   The actual closing date/time for the receipt of proposals will be established in the solicitation.   Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.   See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions.   For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Mr. W. A. Woodring, Code 02P22B at William_A_Woodring@phil.fisc.navy.mil or 215-697-9644.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: This is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contract AT THE NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL, MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA.  The procurement method for this solicitation is best value, trade-off source selection. The government will evaluate proposals using two-phase source selection procedures.  The contract will be awarded to the firm providing the proposal with the best value to the Government using factors outlined in the solicitation.  There are a total of three technical evaluation factors, two sub-factors, and a price factor.  The technical factors are Corporate Experience, Past Performance, and Technical and Management Approach. The Technical/Management Approach factor is further broken down to include: 1) Capacity to accomplish the work; and 2) Key project personnel.  These evaluation criteria were chosen to insure that the selected contractor has a satisfactory past performance record; has experience in coordination and management of concurrent multiple projects; has qualified technical and management personnel to perform related tasks; and has the necessary capabilities and capacity to perform.  The price proposal will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness of the offeror?s proposal on the seed project.  Contractor response to Factors 1, 2, and 3 above will be due approximately 14 August 2002 with the complete proposal; price is due approximately 15 September 2002.  This procurement solicitation shall result in award of one Construction IDIQ contract.  This solicitation is set aside and shall be competed amongst 8(a) firms certified by the SBA Fresno, Sacramento, and San Francisco district offices.  All other firms are deemed ineligible for award. Contractors will be required to furnish all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, and supervision primarily for miscellaneous minor construction, alteration, maintenance, repair, and other incidental related work for the Naval Postgraduate School and tenant facilities and areas.  The contract awarded under the solicitation is intended to provide a timely response to cover a broad range of maintenance, repair, and construction services of real property (i.e. carpentry, asphalt and concrete paving, roofing, interior renovation, electrical, plumbing, painting, masonry, and HVAC) throughout the Naval Postgraduate School.  Performance is at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. The seed project statement of work will be provided via an amendment to the solicitation. Projects awarded under the Construction IDIQ contract will use the task order concept approach to scoping and pricing of work. The process consists of on-site walk throughs with the IDIQ contractor and appropriate Government personnel to jointly develop the statement of work.  Contractor will then submit a cost proposal based upon the scope of work for review and negotiation.  The NAICS Code is 233320.  The related small business size standard is 28.5 million.

<DESC>SUBJECT: DEVELOP ELECTRONIC CASING TALLY SOFTWARE FOR POCKET PC. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to Maurer Technology Inc., Houston, TX to complete the following statement of work. STATEMENT OF WORK: "DEVELOP ELECTRONIC CASING TALLY SOFTWARE FOR POCKET PC". Project Objective - The objective for this project is to develop a casing tally sheet program (PPCTally) for Pocket PCS.  The data will be entered into the Pocket PC at the pipe rack, yard or on the rig floor.  The user can then select or "drag and drop" the joint data into the tally sheet when running into or out of the hole. Task 1 - Select Tally Sheets. A standard casing tally sheet will be selected to put onto Pocket PCS. Task 2 - Develop Pocket PC Electronic Tally Sheet. A Pocket PC tally sheet will be developed for conventional rig floor operations where the drilling crew measures the length of each joint of casing on the pipe rack or as the joints are pulled up to the rig floor. PPCTALLEY will contain three operational windows: *Data Entry window *Inventory "Drag and Drop" operational window and *Tally Sheet The program will be developed using visual basic or a web based programming language to facilitate INTERNET or web based downloading.  This will allow for smaller memory allocation and size for slower download baud rates. Task 2.1 - Develop Data Entry Window: This window will be the user interface where actual joint numbers and lengths are input into the inventory system and tally sheet.  The window will be developed using a "pop up" data entry system developed for Pocket PC's. This pop up screen resembles a calculator with large "buttons" to allow ease of data input.  Options for English and metric measurements will be included.  A default button will be in this window to allow for a whole number to be carried into the data entry (i.e., 20, 30, or 40) so that this number does not have to be repeated during every entry.  The user would then input the decimal part of the measurement, saving time and money. Task 2.2 - Inventory "Drag and Drop" Window: This window will allow the user to select or remove casing joints for input into the tally sheet.  Total length in inventory, average joint length, and current joint number and length are shown on this screen.  Additionally, the user can select the "view tally sheet" and see the sheet at any time while in this window.  A maximum of 5-10 joints of pipe will be shown on this screen to allow ease of selection with the smaller screens typical of a pocket PC. The user can also sort the inventory by length, joint or sequence number in this window. Task 2.3 - Tally Sheet Window: This window will display the tally sheet and show sequence number, joint number, length, and average joint length.  This window will contain the header information and will be suitable for printing.  The tally sheet, once constructed from the inventory window, will contain an option to be saved in an ASCII format.  Once in an ASCII format file the tally sheet can then be transferred to a PC (either laptop or desktop) for use with Microsoft Excel. Task 3 - Provide INTERNET Down-Loadable Program: Write a program that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) can host on its in-house computer that will allow drilling engineers and rig personnel worldwide to download the tally sheet into Pocket PCs. Development Sequence. 1.  Interface Design - Three forms (interfaces) will be included: *Data Entry Inventory *Number Keyboard and *Tally Sheet. 2.  Coding and Debugging. 3.  Testing. 4.  Security Check. 5.  Downloading Procedure. 6.  Help and User's Manual. Requirement: This utility of the software has to be based on the type of programming developed for the DEA (Drilling Engineering Association) projects 44, 67, and 101.  The utility of these programs was enhanced by and based on the significant field input received from industry.  Additional detail on these projects can be found on the DEA website at www.dea.main.com.  END OF SOW This request is considered to be sole source to Maurer Technology Inc, Houston, TX because their personnel are uniquely qualified to perform the required tasks and the following reasons: Maurer Technology Inc have the following unique capabilities - (1) Extensive prior experience with development of similar programs from the DOE/NETL in association with the Drilling Engineering Association; (2) Experience in development of complementary programs such as the "Driller's Toolkit" (see article in IADC's Drilling Contractors Magazine, September/October, 2001) for engineering field use. This request is considered to be sole source to Maurer Technology Inc. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Requests for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS. For technical questions please contact the Technical Representative Ms. Virginia Weyland at 918-699-2041. Request for contract information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-892-6216 and e-mail mohn@netl.doe.gov.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.   

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is soliciting proposals on Next Generation Ladar for Driving Unmanned Ground Vehicles.Based on the experience gained in support of the Army Research Lab (ARL) Demo III Unmanned Ground Vehicle program over the past four years, the Intelligent Systems Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has identified the need for high performance Ladar sensors for autonomous on and off-road driving. These sensors will be mounted on UGVs and are needed to provide reliable and robust obstacle/object detection and terrain feature information. The sensors will provide information about the environment surrounding the vehicle sufficient to enable the vehicle to drive autonomously. Current Ladar sensors used in UGV research have proven to have limitations in performance, are large in size and are expensive.  Phase I of this solicitation is for the design of an Engineering Prototype to advance the Ladar range imaging component/subsystem technologies to meet the needs for UGVs. Phase II will support prototype development.

The Government envisions the requirement for two types of Ladar range imaging sensors for this type of application, one having a wide field-of-view (40 X 90 deg.) with a resolution of about .25 degrees or better per pixel and the second, a foveal Ladar having a narrow field-of-view of approximately 1/10th of the wide field-of-view with a resolution of about .05 degrees or better per pixel. Inter-pixel spacing of no more than 10% of the specified spatial resolution is anticipated. The intent is to make the foveal Ladar steerable to any position within the field-of-view of the wide angle Ladar. Both types of Ladar sensors shall have a range resolution of about 5 cm in range, shall be able to detect the ground plane out to a distance of at least 40 meters and vertical surfaces out to a range of at least 100 meters. 10 Hz frame rates or better are expected. Both Ladars must be eye safe and shall be provided with capability to penetrate dust, fog, grass and light foliage (either by sensing multiple returns or looking for the last return) and be able to operate in full sunlight conditions. The criterion for scoring the proposed designs are provided below.

Two Phases are planned for this solicitation.  Phase I is intended to obtain designs.  Phase II may proceed to fund a prototype(s).   In Phase I, in response to this solicitation, responders are to submit proposals describing their intended design concept and their capabilities to perform the design.  Full designs are not sought at this point, however, the concept must be capable of leading to a design (and possibly a prototype) that can address the technical specifications provided below.  The concept description must include relevant analytical explanation and/or experimental data required to support the concept.  The concept description must make clear the principals of operation, attest to the scientific validity of the approach, and show how the proposed concept shall support the specifications.  These proposals shall be evaluated and one or more responders may be funded to develop a full design for their concept(s).  In Phase II, the completed designs shall be evaluated, and an award or awards may be made to developers of selected designs to build a prototype(s) according to the selected design(s).

The following describes the Phase I and Phase II components of this solicitation in more detail:

Phase I: Detailed concept design for Wide FOV Ladar, Narrow (foveal) Ladar or for the combination of both.
  	Concept Proposal:
o Proposals for the development of designs shall be reviewed and scored.
o As many as four awards to develop and provide designs may be given depending on proposal quality and available funding.
Design:
o Award funding level will be at least $50K for each award to provide a design. Higher award amounts are possible and will be based on"best value" to the Government.
o Within three months of an award, the offeror shall provide a detailed design for NIST to review.
o A budget and schedule plan (including when a prototype will be available for testing) shall be provided with the design.
o As part of the design, the offeror shall identify proposed computer interfaces necessary to interact with the sensor or sensor platform components, and describe the proposed software organization and proposed algorithms. Capability to be synchronized with external timing source shall also be supported by the design.

Evaluation of Phase I
The criteria and weights to be used for evaluation of proposals to develop a design will be:
1.	Soundness, technical merit, and innovation (Maximum 40 points)
In addition to the general technical soundness of the proposed concept, technical merit includes the likelihood that the proposed concept can lead to a design (and possibly eventual prototype) that can score well with respect to the specifications given below.
2.	Qualifications of the proposed technical staff to perform proposed conceptual design (Maximum 30 points)
Includes evaluation of experience with Ladar systems and similar or related system design experience, knowledge of Ladar measurement and performance issues, and knowledge of current approaches.
3.	Potential for use in military UGV applications and product development          (Maximum 30 points)
Degree to which concept can be applicable to unmanned ground vehicle systems.  Proposer shall show knowledge of technical issues associated with this application domain, and indicate how they will be addressed.


The following specifications define the performance capabilities desired in the next generation Ladar systems being sought.  In Phase I, the submitted design concepts will be evaluated  according to the criteria above, which includes the likelihood that the proposed concept can lead to a design (and possibly eventual prototype) that can score well with respect to these specifications.    In Phase II, these specifications and the associated points shown, will be used to score full designs as the means to evaluate the full designs for possible awards to build a prototype(s).  

Ladar Specifications (and Phase II Points):

The first two items are for the Wide FOV Ladar. The next two are for the Narrow FOV Ladar.  The Wide FOV and Narrow FOV designs will be scored separately, whether they are for part of a single, combined system or are for independent Wide FOV and Narrow FOV systems.

				Vertical FOV        Points 	Horizontal FOV      Points
Wide Field-of-view Ladar 	   40 deg		4	   90 deg		4
				< 40 but not < 30 deg	3	< 90 but not < 60 deg	3				       		< 30 deg		0	< 60 deg		0
				> 40 deg		5	> 90 deg		5

Wide FOV Ladar		
Spatial pixel resolution	.25 - <.3 deg 				12		
				< .25 deg				15		 
				.3 - .5 deg 				8		
				> .5 deg				0		

Narrow (foveal) FOV Ladar:	If a design for a foveal Ladar is offered, the proposed FOV will be rated on technical merit in combination with the proposed spatial resolution. A maximum of 10 points is possible. It is expected that the FOV shall not be less than 4 X 4 deg. or larger than 9 X 9 deg.

Narrow FOV Ladar                                                                        Points
Spatial pixel resolution	.05 - <.06 deg.				12
				< .05 deg				15
				.06 - .1 deg				8
				> .1 deg				0
The following specifications are common to either the Wide FOV or Narrow FOV Ladar
							
Range resolution		5 - 10 cm				3
(over min. to max. 		> 10 cm				0
measurement range)		< 5 cm					5

Dust, smoke, foliage, etc.	Yes. Scoring will depend on technical8 - 15
Penetration			quality of approach
				No.					0
				Potential solution provided		8

Maximum possible score of each type of Ladar for technical specifications:	110

Other Design Considerations:

Acceptable designs will be determined through evaluation of the above criteria.   Among the acceptable designs, additional points are available to those designs that may optionally address the following:  
Since the Ladars sought are engineering prototypes, requirements on size, weight, power, shock and vibration, protection from rain/humidity and temperature range of operation are not critical. However, since the ultimate intent is for vehicle-based systems, up to 10 additional points will be awarded for proposed designs according to their feasibility of implementation on Demo III XUV type (2500 - 3000 lb.) vehicles, where size, weight, power, shock and vibration, protection from rain/humidity and temperature range of operation will be important. It is anticipated that the size of the production prototypes for that purpose will need to be smaller than a cylinder (20 - 25 cm. high and about 12 cm. across)

If a design for a foveal pan/tilt stage is offered (in addition to the Ladar imager), up to 10 additional points will be awarded according to its technical merit. Servos in the stage shall be capable of at least 3 saccades (point to point moves) per second. Designs for image stabilization must also be provided.

Phase II: Engineering Prototype Development

The designs developed under Phase I award(s) will be evaluated according to the specifications and points above.  Based on the quality of the designs and availability of funding, NIST will consider funding one or more contracts to build a prototype Wide FOV Ladar, a Narrow (foveal) Ladar or a combination of both. We anticipate making Phase II award selections before the end of the calendar year.  For any prototype that is developed, the offeror shall fully describe interfaces necessary to interact with the sensor platform components, and provide software required to control components. Capability to be synchronized with external timing source shall also be provided.

DOCUMENT SECURITY NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS
This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.
REASONABLE CARE:
1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.
NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that
the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:
Valid identification fornon-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: (a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and
testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun &
Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and
(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,
(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s)picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.
2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after
completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.
4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable 
and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building
information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The prototype MSR system will be des igned, developed, built, integrated, demonstrated, and will meet as many of the capability objectives as possible, within 3 years and less than $1,500,000 in funding.  The MSR objectives are: 1) 3 to 4 independent receiver stations (preferably 4, for added redundancy).  2) 1 to 2 meter aperture dish. 3) Tunable Frequency range of 2 - 18 GHz preferred; Offerer to otherwise propose an affordable frequency range.  4) Instantaneous bandwidth of 500 MHz -1 GHz preferred, Offerer will otherwise propose an affordable bandwidth.  5) Operate in conjunction with the RF waveforms generated from the fleet of WSMR radars; the ASR-9 an S-Band surveillance radar, the FPS-16, MPS-36, and MPS-39 (C-Band instrumentation radars; pulsed, low PRF, linear vertical, dish and phased array systems) .  6) Operate with other visiting RF sensors and should therefore be flexible in frequency, bandwidth, pulse repetition, pulse width, polarizations, and other pertinent waveform parameters.  7) Provide the necessary target information utilized in trilateration/triangulation processing of multistatic, multi-station receiver systems. The data products will include (per receiver station), but will not be limited to: &#61623; Time of echo arrival &#61623; RCS &#61623; AGC &#61623; Doppler &#61623; I&Q (multiple sample gates preferred). &#61623; Wide Bandwidth Imaging 8) Processed, multi-station Data products will include: &#61623; high fidelity target position (accurate to within 1 meter RMS),  &#61623; velocity (accurate to within 1 meter/sec),  &#61623; acceleration (within 1.5 meter/sec**2) ,  &#61623; RCS (within 1dBsm).  &#61623; Wide Bandwidth Imaging &#61623; The receiver systems will be networked using Ethernet connectivity, and will provide the data fusion processor all the necessary information required for multi-station target tracking and sensing. 9) At minimum, the MSR shall operate in conjunction with the C-Band radars to include the processing of .25, .5, and 1 micro-second pulse signals. Additionally, the phased array, C-Band radars are capable of transmitting 3, 7, 12 and 50 microsecond pulse-w aveforms. Pulse compression of the signals should be performed wherever possible.  10) Signal processing must operate with both coherent and non-coherent radars and must incorporate state of the art techniques for various types of signal filtering, and integration, including MTI processing (Doppler-based, and/or clutter cancellation).  11) The prototype system will be a passive, slaved system (antenna position to be pointed by existing, active sensors), however; the design must allow for growth to a production system with closed-loop, active, monostatic tracking modes (possibly phased ar ray), while maintaining the multistatic receiver capabilities of its' predecessor.   12) Capable of receiver frequency hopping, such that each receiver station can operate and process, multiple target echoes at multiple frequencies.  The subject receiver system should be limited to commercially available components where possible.  This will reduce the non-recurring engineering (design) costs, additionally making it more maintainable, upgradeable, and thus providing a more affordable s ystem.   A preliminary design competition will be conducted in order to determine who will be selected to proceed with this project.  We will award up to four orders for the preliminary design at a cost not to exceed $25K. If you are selected for this initial phase , you shall have six weeks to prepare a presentation and provide a written proposal that defines the specifications, cost, and development schedule of the proposed MSR system complete with:  &#61623; descriptions of hardware and software;  &#61623; sy stem and subsystem performance;  &#61623; WSMR interfaces;  &#61623; range and angle accuracy;  &#61623; size;  &#61623; power;  &#61623; RF characteristics;  &#61623; operations doctrine;  &#61623; environmental requirements;  &#61623; anticipated manpower for operation and maintenance;  &#61623; risk assessment of meeting performance, cost, and schedule requirements.   If you are interested in participating in this project, you shall submit a notice of interest to Mr. Ray Lazano at lozanor@wsmr.army.mil no later than COB 14 June 2002.  You shall also include a brief summary of fielded pertinent experience and resumes for  your key design personnel, including point of contacts as references.  In the event more than four notices of interest are received, the four contractors offering the most relevant past experience and most qualified personnel shall be selected. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS for this requirement is 334511 with a size code of 750.  See Note 1.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, e-mail:  ekunene@tda.gov, "DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE."  :  Proposal Submission Place  :  Mr. Petio Staikov, Chief Executive Officer, Eurocom Cable JSC, 3A, 165 Street, floor 6, Izgrev, 1797 Sofia, Bulgaria  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to review and analyze Eurocom Cable?s operations in detail and make recommendations for the further development of its network throughout Bulgaria.  

Eurocom was formed in October 2001 by the consolidation of twelve small entities.  The company currently has 60,000 subscribers and management expects to increase the subscriber base to 400,000 over a three year period.  This will be accomplished through internal growth and construction, as well as acquisitions.  For the systems that have already been acquired, substantial technical upgrades need to be performed to bring them up to Eurocom?s technical standards.

The company currently has 35,000 subscribers in Sofia and covers approximately 70% of the homes in the Sofia market.  There are five cable operators in the Sofia market.  Many areas of Sofia have at least two cable operators, and up to four cable operators can operate in a single area.  Eurocom has been gaining 1,000 subscribers per month in Sofia and has been in operation in the market for many years.  The main cities served by Eurocom besides Sofia are Plevin (11,000 subscribers), Veliko Turnovo (7,000 subscribers), and Lom ( 2000 subscribers).

Eurocom?s systems provide a single basic programming package.  In most cases, they provide 68 television channels and 8 radio channels.  Twenty of the channels are Bulgarian, and tend to be the most popular.  Many cable operators have their own programming channel.  The Eurocom National Cable channel, which is produced by a separately-owned company with common ownership ties to Eurocom, is the fourth most popular channel in Bulgaria.  The basic service costs 14.4 lev per month (approximately $6.50), which includes 20% VAT.  Eurocom will be launching HBO in April 2002 with Bulgarian subtitles, which will cost $5.00 per month for a subscription.  

Eurocom?s cable systems have been acquired from a number of different sources, and therefore represent a range of technical capabilities and construction quality.  Their equipment is a mixture of U.S. and European origin.

Expansion plans for Eurocom are concentrating on Sofia, since they estimate that 80% of the Bulgarian telecommunications market is in Sofia.  Sofia is the biggest market, has the strongest economy, and bad debt is less of a problem than elsewhere in the country.  The drawback of focusing on Sofia is that it has the most competition.  The company?s secondary focus is on developing their systems in Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas, and Ruse.  In Sofia, their current objectives are to complete the fiber optic ring which currently has nine nodes, upgrade the systems they have acquired, be able to offer the fiber optic network to ISP?s (internet service providers), and subsequently offer telephony services.  Eurocom will also need to determine where to focus their marketing efforts ? on the commercial or residential sector.  Initially, they are expecting mostly commercial customers for their HSA (high-speed access) service.

The Southeast Europe Equity Fund (SEEF) recently announced an initial investment of $10 million towards the development of Eurocom.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $153,975 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, July 16, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This is the re-establishment/re-posting of the synopsis which first appeared on May 2, 2002. There will be a delay of about two weeks in publishing/uploading the RFP to the EPS.  The revised estimated RFP issuance date is June 19, 2002.  Thank you for your patience on this matter. Repeat of original synopsis:
The Department of Justice, Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and the Tax Division, have a continuing requirement for a contractor to provide various nonpersonal administrative support services such as copy, file, and supply room operations, scanning and faxing services, interbuilding mail messenger services, and copy machine maintenance.  The contract is available for use by all DOJ components, but its focus is on the ENRD and Tax Divisions.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (est. at 45-65 positions), providing and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and supplies, in order to successfully perform these tasks for ENRD and Tax at fixed unit prices per month, fixed price per piece, and on a labor hour (t&m), ID/IQ basis.  The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with some staffing to be provided in Denver, CO, and copy machine maintenance to be provided in other cities such as Sacramento and San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and Anchorage, AK.  The anticipated period of performance is October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, with four additional option years available to extend the term of the contract through September 30, 2007.  The current contract (DOJ No. 97-C-0037) providing these services expires 09/30/2002 but may be extended if needed.  This RFP will be a "full and open" competition for a single contractor to provide the entirety of the requirements; accordingly any proposals to provide only parts of the requirements will not be considered.  No advance information or meetings regarding the RFP are available at this time - it is anticipated that the RFP will be uploaded to the EPS not later than June 5, 2002.  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 and large business offerors will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  However, this RFP requirement is not a set-aside of any type.

<DESC>SUBJECT: MARKET CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION MARKET PROJECT. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to TecMRKT Works, Rockville, MD to complete the following statement of work. STATEMENT OF WORK: "MARKET CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION MARKET PROJECT". OVERVIEW: The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Building Technology, State and Community Programs, is interested in gaining a better understanding of the commercial new construction market so that it can better understand the needs and operation of this market and more effectively diffuse the technologies it is developing into the market.  The commercial building market includes but is not limited to offices, retail, health care, hospitality, public assembly, education, and worship. GOALS OF THE PROJECT: To complete a market characterization of the new construction market.  The goals of this project are to identify: *the types and kinds of new commercial structures that are being built and will be built in the short and long-term *the levels of commercial new construction activity by locale and by types and kinds of structures *the number and size of players, including developers, owners, architecture and engineering firms, especially the major national and regional players *the interactions among the players including patterns of association and information exchange *segments within the market where the players share similar patterns of decision making, capital use, or technology needs *process by which new commercial building construction is completed and the forces at work within the process that influence the energy efficiency of buildings *the role of zoning and local codes code enforcement in influencing the energy efficiency of buildings *individuals and firms within the market who are looked to by others and who influence trends *forces at work that are changing the way players relate to one another and the way they make decisions *strategies that might accelerate and increase the acceptance of energy efficient technologies and whole building design concepts. APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM: The approach to this problem is to use secondary data sources to assemble a picture of the levels of activity, location and players in the commercial new construction market.  In-depth interviews with key market players are to be used to provide additional insight into the operation and workings of the market.  This information is to be combined to identify segments within the market and to develop optional strategies that might be used to approach the segments. TASK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE: Task 1: Review the existing literature and identify potential data sources. Recently, there have been a number of studies at the local, state and regional levels that have begun to characterize local and regional commercial buildings markets.  The purpose of this task will be to collect, review and summarize what those studies tell us about the new construction market.  This task should result in a description of what we know about the commercial buildings market and identification of the gaps in our knowledge. Task 2: Obtain, review and analyze data about the commercial buildings market from secondary data sources. There are numerous sources of data that can be used in an analysis of the commercial buildings market, the trends, and the players in the market. National Real Estate Investor Magazine publishers a listing of the many types of commercial real estate companies.  Other types of data that might be used include the F.W. Dodge Data and more local sources of data such as California's Construction Industry Research Board.  There are numerous other sources of data that can utilized.  Data will be obtained from various sources and analyzed to develop a picture of commercial new building markets nationwide.  Of particular interest will be who the major players areincluding developers, owners, architectural and engineering firms, and contractors. Task 3: Conduct interviews with selected players in the commercial new construction market. This task involves several steps.  The first is to identify key players to be interviewed.  These will include selected individuals in the largest office firms, mall developers, associations that serve large property owners, for example BOMA, construction divisions of large developers and mall developers, architecture and engineering firms, and others.  The second step will be to develop the protocol(s) for the interviews.  Several variants of a protocol will be needed in order to address issues with the different players in the market.  The third step will be to conduct the interviews.  The interviews will be completed in person and by telephone.  The length of the interviews will be about an hour to an hour and a half or more depending on the subject.  We anticipate completing about 30 - 35 interviews.  The fourth step will be to compile and analyze the data. Task 4: Produce a draft and final report describing the new construction market. To produce a draft report for review.  Once comments are received a final report will be produced. Task 5: Reporting. A monthly report and update will be provided to the project manager.

<DESC>Please see below some answers to questions that have been raised with regard to this procurement. 1.  Are the Ametek heat exchangers currently in use a fixed tubesheet or floating tube sheet design? The heat exchangers have a floating tubesheet design and are removable.  This is indicated by the minimum distance required to remove the tubes on the Ametek drawings. 2.  If the existing heat exchangers are floating tube sheet design, what is the rear head TEMA designation? The rear head shall comply with TEMA standards and allow the tubesheet to be removed from the front end. 3.  What is the specific gravity or the mix percentage of the electrolyte?  Is the mix percentage by weight or volume? The electrolyte is a mixture of deionized water and sodium carbonate (approximately 0.2% sodium carbonate) 4.  In assuming the operating pressure is the same as the design pressure, this may result in higher than typical calculated pressure drops.  What is the normal operating pressure for the shell side and the tube side? Currently, the operating pressures are approximately: 50 psi on the shell side and 30 psi on the tube side. 5.  Can the body flanges be standard ANSI 150# RFSO flanges?  The outside diameter of the ANSI standard is different than the 34 5/8" OD shown on the drawing? Body flanges can be standard ANSI 150# RFSO flanges since this dimension is not critical for direct replacement of existing heat exchangers.  Note, as stated in the requirements, all external connection points and supports shall be sized and located as shown on Ametek drawing 5329-A-5 and the exchanger shall be fabricated as a direct replacement of the existing exchanger without modifications to existing piping or supports.

<DESC>Research and development sources are sought for the Air Force Research Laboratory?s (AFRL?s) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate?s Satellite Assessment Center (SatAC).  SatAC is the Air Force-chartered organization that evaluates directed energy effects on space systems and performs assessments of space system susceptibilities to directed energy sources for the Department of Defense (reference DoD Instruction 3100.11) and develops tools to perform satellite and space systems technical analyses.  Space systems are defined to include satellites, missiles (tactical and ballistic), and the respective supporting architectures.   To support this objective, SatAC is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed on-site at the Air Force Research Laboratory,  Kirtland AFB, NM, and at contractors' facilities, and at third-party facilities:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information; (B) System Assessments; (C) Computer Science Support.  Descriptions of each of these major areas follows:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information includes obtaining, analyzing, and utilizing information in order to develop detailed system structural and functional models.  (B) Space system assessments are physics-based and include interactions with space weather, laser, radio frequency, high-power microwave, and other directed energy mechanisms from ground, air, space, or other emission sources.  Assessments include vulnerability analysis, astrodynamics, and other relevant aspects of system-level analyses.  (C) Computer Science Support encompasses development and use of software and databases to support system modeling, system assessment, assessment methodology automation, smart data fusion techniques and methods as applied to:   Space Situational Awareness (SSA), databases (multi-tier and relational), artificial intelligence, and automated tools/graphical user interfaces (GUIs) delivered to operational DoD customers.  A primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support SATAC research programs such as Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in support of DoD information dominance requirements for space. A read-file is available for review by contacting Capt. Lance Hrivnak, at (505) 846-3342, for an appointment.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ), cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion, term form, type contract is contemplated with a task-ordering period of 7 years.  The anticipated maximum ordering value is $49M.  Small businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine whether the acquisition should be set aside for small businesses.  Based on the results of the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside this requirement for small businesses.  Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, or Historically Black College or University.  The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  (1)  Expertise in state-of-the-art satellite design (ISR, communication, navigation, and weather).  (2) Independent research and development programs conducted within the last three years in the technical areas being solicited and a description of significant results of such projects.  (3) Experience with the international space industry.  (4)  Demonstration of ability to conduct experiments in laboratory and field environments and a description of other areas of experience in the performance of experiments.  (5)  Demonstration of knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the physics, engineering, operation, and function of DoD imaging sensors, such as the AFRL Starfire Optical Range, and the exploitation of their respective data types.  (6) Experience with industry standard software codes and tools (for example, C++, FORTRAN, html/xml, ORACLE)  (7) Experience working with and interacting within the DOD space control and intelligence communities  (8) Experience and ability managing research resources to ensure that technical efforts are completed on schedule, within cost, and capable of supporting sporadic, quick turnaround efforts, and surge capability in support of short-notice, multi-million dollar projects.  (9) Demonstration of ability to develop new technical expertise in response to new space control assessment mission areas. Interested small businesses are requested to submit a statement of capability (original plus 2 copies) within 15 calendar days of this announcement, substantiating each qualification described in (1) through (9) above for RFP F29601-02-R-0006 to Det 8 AFRL/PKDL, Attn:  Maggie Howe, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM, 87117-5773.  Any responses received not addressing all of the above requirements will be rejected.  The capability statements shall be limited to 18 pages, not to exceed two pages per area, single spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman, excluding resumes.  Regarding resumes, name, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who may be assigned as Program Manager may be included that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  If required, to communicate contractor capabilities, TOP SECRET information will be accepted.  Please contact Capt. Lance Hrivnak, at (505) 846-3342, to arrange for delivery of any classified material.  However, whenever possible, submitted information will be unclassified.  Offerors should be aware that the majority of resources must be employed within a Top Secret environment.  A statement must be addressed by prospective offerors as to the ability to obtain, within 30 days of contract award, an industrial security clearance, the personnel and available storage facilities to support work at the Top Secret level.  Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract.  Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, ?Organizational Conflict of Interest? (Jul 1997).  This is not a Request For Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any costs incurred as a result of this announcement shall be borne by the offeror and will not be charged to the Government for reimbursement. If your interest is in subcontracting possibilities, please indicate this clearly in your submission.  All respondents desiring a copy of future solicitations must provide a point of contact, complete mailing address, telephone and fax number, and email address.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to mediate concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions.  The Ombudsman does not participate in proposal evaluation or contractor selection. The Ombudsman can work with responsible acquisition officials to respond to concerns, but will not detract from the authorities of the Project Manager or Contracting Officer.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain the confidentiality of sources.  The Ombudsman at Phillips Research Site is Mr. Eugene C. DeWall, Director of Contracting, Det 8 AFRL/PK, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM, 87117-5773; (505) 846-4979.  Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first refer contracting concerns to the Contracting Officer, David Castillo at (505) 853-3306, or refer technical concerns to the Project Manager, Capt Lance Hrivnak at (505) 846-3342.  It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.

<SUBJECT>28 -- Technology Transfer Opportunity - Internal Combustion Engine Driven Electrical Generators
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is working towards developing a new concept in internal combustion engine driven electrical generators.  The Livermore based program is geared toward demonstration of a 30 kilowatt prototype generator in two years.  The program is founded on understanding and quantification of the myriad of components making up the prototype during the development process.

The concept utilizes homogeneous charge compression ignition of ultra lean fuel/air charges to reduce NOx formation and approach ideal Otto cycle performance.  A unique free piston/linear alternator configuration is utilized to great advantage to electronically control the operating compression ratio of the engine and drastically reduce the number of moving parts.

Combustion system experiments and extensive fluid, dynamic and electromagnetic calculations have resulted in a projected fuel to electricity conversion efficiency for the prototype of 50%, with essentially zero NOx emissions.  

Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partners to be a part of this exciting effort.  Of particular value would be industrial participants with experience in providing a path to market following a successful prototype demonstration.  Expertise in the area of linear motors or generators, engine control and management electronics, electrical power conditioning, camless valve actuation, turbocharger production and piston engine technology is especially appropriate.   

For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski by June 21, 2002 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380.  Fax (505) 843-4163 or email to adulsk@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your firm could best contribute to the further development or commercialization of this technology.
