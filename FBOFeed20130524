<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for resurfacing the Evan Hewes Highway located in Imperial County, CA roughly  mile West of Gordon's Well Interstate 8 (I-8) (Exit 151) interchange to just West of the Brock Research Center I-8 (Exit 146) interchange and is about .34 miles long.
Project Description:  The Evan Hewes Highway is an existing highway originally constructed to replace the Old Plank Road through the sand dunes between Yuma, AZ and El Centro, CA and continuing through to San Diego, CA. The original asphalt road was constructed in the mid 1920's by the state of California and decommissioned in the mid 1960's when I-8 was built. During its period of service it was replaced once and received numerous overlays and repairs. This section of road has been used primarily for access to the sand dunes recreation area in low volume traffic conditions. Most recently, Evan Hewes Highway has been used for construction traffic for the building of the new Brock Storage Reservoir and associated structures.  As part of the encroachment permit agreement with Imperial County, Reclamation agreed to return the temporary realigned portion of the roadway to its previous alignment and condition.
The principal components of work to be performed include the following:
1.  Excavating out and stockpiling the designated base material to a stockpile location in the W. H. Brock Reservoir.
2.  Furnish, install, and compact new aggregate road base in the designated area.
3.  Furnish and place new asphalt section on designated area (2" asphalt pavement, 3/8" ARAM membrane layer, and 2" aggregate rubber hot mix (ARHM)) per Statement of Work.
4.  Stripping of the newly rebuilt section of roadway per Statement of Work.
5.  Provide any temporary construction signage, barricades, flagmen, etc. as necessary for completion of the work.  
This solicitation is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this project is 237310 Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction with a corresponding small business size standard of $33.5M.  Therefore, invitation for bids will be extended to firms eligible under the Small Business Program. There will be a formal public bid opening.  This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the method outlined in FAR Part 14 - Sealed Bidding.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price construction type.  
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin October 1, 2013 with an anticipated completion date of December 30, 2013. 
Bid Bond, Payment and Performance Bonds are required.
The magnitude of this construction project is estimated to be between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  The anticipated period of performance is 90 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available only through Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about July 12, 2013.  A site visit/pre-proposal conference will be held on or about July 23, 2013.  Bids will be due on or about  August 12, 2013.  All bid forms, bid bonds, and other normal documents required for the bid submittal, including amendments to the bid submittal, shall be in paper medium.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continuation of engineering technicians and other trade skills to perform testing, ground and space based research, test operations, data analysis, instrumentation calibration, machine and electrical shop operations, and other technical activities under the current Marshall Engineering Technicians and Trades Support Services contract (METTS) Contract. It is recommended this action be accomplished through a 1-year extension to the METTS contract with Info Pro Corporation (IPC) with an estimated value of $12.1 million. Approval of this action will allow for continuation and stability of these services through the completion of the re-competition process for the follow-on METTS requirement. IPC is uniquely positioned to continue providing the engineering technician and related services in support of Space Launch System (SLS) during this time of design, fabrication and testing.  IPC has been the support contractor providing engineering technician and related skills to MSFC since initiation of the SLS Program.  Use of IPCs existing and proven capabilities will permit the timely execution of significant tasks that are necessary for achieving SLS milestones. In support of International Space Station (ISS), IPC has provided significant contributions in the success of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Project.  Currently, the ECLSS Project is scheduled to ramp down to a close approximately March-April 2014.  No other source is capable of delivering final fabrication and assembly of this hardware without introducing attrition-related schedule and performance risks for MSFC.  IPC has been providing support to Propellant and Pressurant (P&P) Services since September 2010, when it was transitioned to METTS from the NASA Test Operations Contract (NTOC).  Since assumption of the work, IPC has provided a significant contribution to the correction of several pressure certification issues identified on MSFC facilities and systems.  These actions are scheduled for completion by the end of 2013.  No other source is capable of completing these actions in the timeframe specified. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 6, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

This contract provides services which operate the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN), to match donor organs with organ recipients under a cost sharing contract which is restricted by statute where the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, as amended, requires the OPTN to be operated under contract with a private non-profit entity with expertise in organ procurement and transplantation. Due to the existence of limited rights in data, the services are available from only one source. On February 22, 2013, HRSA posted solicitation number 13-250-SOL-00022mac, to which UNOS was the sole responder. Accordingly, UNOS is deemed the only responsible source capable of performing the work and the services of this modification under the authority in 41 U.S.C. &sect; 253(c)(1) and as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) and (b). The extension, if all options are exercised, will have a total period of performance of sixty-three(63) months containing a base period of nine(9) months, an option period one of six(6) months, and four(4) one year option periods thereafter. This is not a solicitation. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition(JOFOC) will be prepared. If an award results from this JOFOC, a copy of this JOFOC will be posted at this site in accordance with FAR 6.305(a) and (d). Pursuant to FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), an interested party may submit, within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 5.203(a), of the date of this notice of posting, capability statements, and expressions of interest which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions 9609 Medical Center Dr RM 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Philips Medical Systems 595 Miner Rd, Highland Hts., OH 44143 for a Multi-Nuclei upgrade.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25 million.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>NCI is initiating metabolic MRI studies in humans to profile tumors on a biochemical basis to aid in improved diagnosis and obtain non-invasive biomarkers for treatment response. To this end, NCI has conducted several preclinical imaging experiments using mouse models of human cancer and metabolic MRI using 13C labeled tracers such as 1-13C pyruvate and 13C- based chemical shift imaging using small animal imaging systems equipped with multi-nulcear detection systems. Such facilities of multinuclear MRI need to be incorporated in the MIP Philips 3.0 T MRI system which currently is capable of detecting signals only from protons (1H). With the incorporation of 13C signal detection capabilities and the SPINLAB polarizer which can prepare clinical grade 13C labeled tracers, NCI's plan is to start clinical studies in humans with renal cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma to profile the metabolic status of tumors and obtain imaging biomarkers useful in diagnosis, staging and treatment planning.</p>
<p>The Multi-Nuclei Spectroscopy Specialist 3.0T is a hardware and software upgrade to the existing Philips 3T Achieva clinical MRI scanner to provide spectroscopy and imaging capability for other nuclei like C-13, P-31, N-15 in addition to protons. Additional hardware is also included to increase the number of receiver channels from the 2 to 6. This is required in order to perform clinical imaging studies with hyperpolarized C-13 and other nuclei to realize 4 to 5 orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity.<br />Without this upgrade, the scanner is only capable of detecting signals from protons. Note that since this upgrade was designed for studies involving normal spin polarization, additional receiver coils, hardware, and software that are optimized for acquiring and reconstructing data from hyperpolarized agents will also be acquired separately. These additions are available only from Philips due to proprietary nature of the hardware, control software and imaging sequences.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on&nbsp;June 10, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130070-EB on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) of Bethesda, MD has a requirement for the procurement of a software license, i.e., Digital Image Correlation (DIC) System VIC-3D to include license, technical support, software upgrades, and on-site training.  The applicable NAICS Code is 511210 Software Publishers and the business size standard is $35.5 million.    

The proposed purchase order is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Correlated Solutions Inc (CSI) of Irmo, SC.  The proposed action is for the procurement of supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The basis for restricting competition is for the following reasons: CSIs VIC-3D software capability includes full-field, 3-dimensional measurements of shape, displacement, and strain.
 CSIs software has the capability of extensive pre-existing data in the VID-3D format that requires post-processing. In addition, NSWCCD personnel can continue collaborations with co-researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) who exclusively use VIC-3D software for DIC measurements.   

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  Inquiries should be directed to Patricia Perzella, telephone 301-227-5994, or patricia.perzella@navy.mil

This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD).  This Request for Information is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201(e), and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the U.
 S. Government, nor should it be construed as such.  Respondents are advised that NSWCDD is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse RFI preparation costs incurred by any offeror when providing the information requested under this notice.  If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.
It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
 
The purpose of this announcement is to determine if any Business Concerns are capable of providing existing technologies to support the NSWCDD Air Domain Awareness (ADA) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  Interested parties are required to submit a capability statement in accordance with the information provided in Section 2. 
1.	Background

Air Domain Awareness (ADA) is the effective understanding of threats associated with the Air Domain. Collection, integration, analysis, and dissemination capabilities based on 20th century threats are no longer sufficient. To maximize ADA, we must transform, and integrate capabilities that collect, analyze, and disseminate surveillance, intelligence and information to create an operational picture that is tailorable to the needs of users.
 ADA achieved through persistent situational knowledge provided to operational decision makers, is a critical enabler in achieving this capability

The reason for this RFI is to obtain knowledge of existing capabilities in industry of software programs that will fuse and display external sensor information. 

The following are the minimum thresholds for the system: 

1.	The System shall have a design that ingest and fuse comprehensive ADA information from 700 or more radar feeds and simultaneously monitor up to 50,000 cooperative and non-cooperative aircraft as individual tracks. The user will be able to view the entire track of the target from point of origin, as well as any associated data about each target as long as the target remains within the monitored sensors range.
 

2.	The System shall receive, fuse and display in near-real time from commercial air traffic control systems as well as DOD radar tracking information database feeds, all radar tracks from fixed and mobile sensor stations available.

3.	The System shall utilize and coordinate the corresponding transponder mode A, C, and S type information. The information will automatically associate and identify the target with the data to be displayed at the operators station in combination with other sensor feeds. 

4.	The System shall automatically and unambiguously resolve multiple radar tracks from multiple radar installations of the same target into a single seamless track of the target. The changeover from station to station shall maintain all historical flight data from the target as it transitions from one feed to the next.
 The individual tracks from any of the sensor stations shall be user selectable if desired when more than one feed exist.

5.	The System shall allow the user to annotate or mark targets of interest as required with the data displayed to all users of the system.

6.	The System shall use drop down menus to allow the user to select options to configure system display features and target data on consoles independently from other users. 

7.	The System shall support multiple users and the addition of remote sites. The addition of users shall not degrade the system capability or performance.

8.	The System operator shall be able to independently monitor any data across the network during peak traffic.
 Flight plan data may enter the system at minimum rate of 1000 feeds per minute the systems shall maintain full capability and performance during this and all phases of the operation.

9.	The System shall have a design that allows ADA monitoring and intelligence gathering from flight altitudes below 500 ft. AGL when sensor data is available. The tracks will be identifiable and traceable as such.

10.	The System shall provide a real-time picture of air activity over an operations area of approximately 3.2 million square miles, by processing a collection of external data imposed over a scalable display which allows system operators to discriminate between "normal" and "suspicious" aircraft, from general aviation, commercial aviation and other forms of manned and unmanned aircraft.
 

11.	The System shall include a subset of situational awareness data sources, but are not limited to Global Positioning System(s) (GPS), datasets from various sensors that include plot data, track data, and air movement data. The subsets or data should be controlled and filtered using operator menu controls. The incoming data subsets should not degrade radar or video sensor feed data. 

12.	The system shall provide automated alerts of suspicious air activity to the users processing terminal and integrate the data feeds into the ADA System. The alert criteria shall be configurable to user requirements and aid in the establishment of target activity patterns. 

13.	The system shall be capable of storing raw sensor information with a capacity for classified electronic media and documents.
  The system shall have the ability to retain 64,000 sensor hours of information at the same imagery rate it was originally received. Storage will be on readily accessible information media (i.e., server drive). The stored data will be retrievable using metadata search criteria.

14.	The System shall include software robustness necessary to operate at peak efficiency, 24 hours/365 days a year, to include weekends and holidays. If this capability requires redundant hardware, specify the required hardware and the provisions for data consistency between systems and planned and unplanned failover provisions.

15.	The System shall interface with and use the available Full-Motion Video (FMV) and still imagery available from sensors and storage.
 The system display will identify to the user that FMV is available for the target from the standard users display. The System will display the FMV as it would any other sensor data from the user menu control. Information flow rate should be sufficient to transfer High Definition Television rate of 1920x1080 pixels, 60 frames-per-second, progressive scan, along with any correlating information (e.g., audio, location, timestamp).

16.	The System architecture shall allow for future changes without degrading current configuration capabilities. The System shall be designed to be modular to allow for rapid integration of future capabilities and reduce lifecycle cost. The addition of sensor feeds shall not degrade current systems operations.
 The system shall be capable of receiving sensor data rates that meet the minimum requirements of video data as stated in requirement 15.

17.	The System shall be capable of displaying overlays including but not limited to aviation and maritime navigation charts, road maps, terrain topography and satellite imagery. The System shall also include the capability to provide the current weather layer. The addition of layers shall not obscure track sensor data.

18.	The System shall create statistics and metrics of airborne tracks and available sensors with current status. The System shall allow the operator to enter remarks and notes about ongoing operations and support status and share this data to other operators using the system.


2.	Capability Statement

Responses should also show demonstrated, recent, relevant experience in the areas of fostering, administering, and managing integrated programs of basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development in the support of ALL items listed in Section 1 above.

<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for quality assurance services in support of its automated litigation support (ALS) contracts. Automated litigation support encompasses a wide range of professional services and products that help attorneys acquire, organize, develop, and present evidence throughout the course of litigation, from pre-filing investigation, through complaint, discovery, and trial, through post-trial briefs and the appeals process. DOJ has well-established ALS programs in place in the Civil Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Criminal Division, the Antitrust Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Executive Office for U. S. Attorneys, and the Tax Division. Much of the work in these programs is performed by ALS contractors under ALS contracts awarded, administered, and monitored by DOJ. The primary purpose of this quality assurance contract will be to: (1) ensure that ALS Contractor deliverables are in compliance with ALS Contract specifications; and, (2) provide the basis for Government acceptance or rejection of ALS Contractor deliverables, in accordance with Contract specifications and requirements. Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, materials, and technologies necessary to provide a wide range of quality assurance services through the course of litigation. Key quality assurance objectives as they relate to litigation support include the following: 1) electronic file processing including images, native files, and loadable files; 2)database integrity, including Web-Based Databases (Completeness Check); 3) image capture, including digital image scanning; 4) document indexing/coding; 5) documentation (case manuals, procedures, and instructions; 6) training sessions; 7) specialized areas; and 8) litigation support processes and procedures. The Government will award one indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for this requirement. It is anticipated that the contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) option periods of one year each. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541199 with a size standard of $10.0 million. The solicitation will be available on or about June 07, 2013. Due date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance of the solicitation. All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration's "Federal Business Opportunities" web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation itself will not be available. Interested parties should periodically check this Internet site for information regarding the schedule and this acquisition.

METHOD OF AWARD - CASCADE PROCEDURE
a.	Any award(s) resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence:

1)	 In accordance with FAR Subpart 19 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis from a cascading method as defined below to firms who submits a highly rated qualification package, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.
2)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.
3)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an 8a, HubZone , or a Women Owned  business concern.
4)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement criteria for award to an 8a, HubZone and Women Owned concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern in accordance with FAR 19.5.

b.	Adequate competition will be deemed to exist if at least two competitive qualification packages are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration.

c.	When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive qualification package from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible firms for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive qualification package is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the qualification package(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the qualification package from the SDVOSB business will then be included with SB qualification package(s) received.
SHORT LIST CRITERIA FOR INTERVIEWS:  Each Board Member will independently evaluate the qualification packages and submit ratings to the Board Chairperson and Contracting Officer.  Board Members will be required to support each rating with narrative to support the rationale for the rating by identifying the strengths and weaknesses that is applicable to the factor.  The Chairperson will compile the rating from all Board Members in one spreadsheet.  After individual evaluation and rating of qualification packages is completed, the VA will conduct consensus call(s) to determine the Consensus SF330 Rating.  The VA intends to conduct interviews with highly qualified firms.

SF 330 QUALIFICATIONS PACKAGE:

The Technical Proposal will be divided into five sections: Knowledge and Relevant Experience; Professional Qualifications; Location and Capacity within CFM Western Region; Past Performance; and Small Business Participation.

Greater weight will be given to Offeror's experience as a prime contractor rather than as a consultant.  More recent and relevant experience will have a greater impact on the assessment than less recent and relevant effort. 

	Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg must submit the following additional documentation for review and approval prior to award: a) A copy of a legally binding Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg agreement, and b) Identification of the party who can legally bind the Joint Venture or Mentor-Protege.  A Memorandum of Understanding or Letter of Intent signed by the Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg partners can be provided with the qualifications package.

Offeror is expected to provide the following information for each project:
1.	Project title, location and brief description including building use (Medical Facility, etc.) and contracting method (e.g., task order, design build, design bid construct, CM at risk, etc). 
2.	Project owner, name, telephone number and email of owner's contact person.
3.	Project Prime Contractor and Major Subcontractors with name, telephone number and email of contact person(s).
4.	Project Statistics including start and completion dates (original vs. actual); cost (original vs. actual) with brief explanation of what is included in the cost; square footage; foundation type; number of levels; and any letters of recommendation, performance evaluations and/or awards received.

B.	Professional Qualifications - Submit a Project Organizational Chart that includes all team members.  The chart will identify the licensed/registered Key Personnel identified below.  Clearly describe the prime responsible firm (or firms if a joint venture or mentor-protg) and individuals as well as the roles and responsibilities of individuals proposed as consultants and subcontractors.  

Key Personnel: Identify the qualifications of key personnel in the disciplines listed below.  Offeror will note if one individual is proposed for more than one position.  For joint venture or mentor-protg submittals and prime professionals with sub-consultant team members, each joint venture partner and/or each sub-consultant will provide letters of commitment to the project team. The offeror agrees to assign to the contract those persons whose resumes, personnel data forms or personnel qualification statements were submitted. If personnel for whatever reason become unavailable for work under the contract for a continuous period exceeding 30 working days, or are expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the proposal, the contractor will propose a substitution of such personnel. All proposed substitutions will be submitted, in writing, to the Contracting Officer at least 15 days prior to the proposed substitution.

Rating Standards and Definitions: 
The technical evaluation factors will be evaluated on an adjectival basis.  Offerors are advised any strengths that are accepted by the government may be incorporated into the contract as the minimum performance requirement.   "Deficiency" is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government  requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.  "Weakness" means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

Adjective	Definition

Outstanding
	Exceeds all or almost all of the VA's requirements.  Contains many significant strengths and no significant weaknesses.  Contains extensive detail to indicate a thorough understanding of the requirements, with a low degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Excellent
	Exceeds some and satisfies all of the VA's requirements.  Contains many significant strengths and few significant weaknesses.  Contains adequate detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Acceptable	Satisfies all or almost all of the VA's requirements.  Contains few significant strengths and few significant weaknesses, or contains no significant strengths or weaknesses.  Contains minimal detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements. 
Marginal
	Satisfies some of the VA's requirements.  Contains no significant strengths and few significant weaknesses or many significant strengths and many significant weaknesses.  Contains minimal or no detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall high degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Unacceptable
	Fails to meet stated requirements and/or contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies which indicate a lack of understanding of the requirements or an offer which cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk.  These conditions may not be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.
Past Performance:  The VA will assign an adjectival rating based on the information provided by the references and any other source.  The Government will evaluate past performance in terms of recency, relevancy and quality.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and will receive a neutral rating.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  The Evaluation Team may consider past performance data from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the Federal Government.  The Government evaluation team will conduct an evaluation based on past performance of offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements, and the Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in fulfilling the solicitation's requirements.


Outstanding	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were highly effective.  
Excellent	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded some requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were effective.
Acceptable	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements.  The contractual performance contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were satisfactory.
Marginal	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements.  Performance indicated that there are some potential risks associated with the quality of work, timeliness of service, and contract performance.  
Unacceptable	Performance did not meet contractual requirements.  The contractual performance reflected a serious problem for which the offeror has yet to identify corrective actions or the offeror's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.
Interviews:  
The shortlist of at least three of the most highly qualified firms will be notified to make a presentation of no more than 45 minutes, which will be followed by 15 minutes of questions and answers.  The attached "A/E Interview Form" will be used, which includes the following eight factors listed below.  The VA will conduct individual and consensus interview evaluations.  


The following interview factors are equal in importance:
1.	Team proposed for this contract
2.	Proposed Management Plan
3.	Relevant Project Experience of Proposed Team
4.	Project Control
5.	Sustainable Design
6.	Miscellaneous Experience and Capabilities
7.	Awards Received for Design Experience
8.	Insurance and Litigation

<DESC>This Sources Sought is being issued for planning purposes only.  The intent of this notice is to identify business concerns capable of performing the requirements described below.  This is not a solicitation.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Natick Contracting Division will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this sources sought.  <br>  <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the US Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center, is seeking sources who are capable of providing services for testing of eye protection products.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541380 - Testing Laboratories and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is 500 employees.  <br>  <br> The service required will consist of performing, and reporting results of, testing on eye protection devices.  The primary types of devices to be tested are protective spectacles and goggles (with or without a prescription lens carrier).  Other devices, such as faceshields and gas masks, may also be tested.   <br>  <br> The types of testing to be performed include:  Ballistic fragmentation impact testing (Vo and V50); ANSI Z87.1 testing; Luminous transmittance; Neutrality; Chromaticity; Ultraviolet absorption; Chemical resistance; Abrasion resistance; Optical distortion; Temperature; Solar radiation; Humidity; Adhesion; Flammability; Variable transmittance characterization, and other testing related to eye protection devices.  <br>  <br> Testing shall be conducted in accordance with the Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP) System Performance Specification (MIL-PRF-32432), or equivalent eye protection related specification, and associated test methods/standards (to include ANSI Z87.1), as well as with MIL-STD-662 - V50 Ballistic Test for Armor, unless otherwise specified.  <br>  <br> Testing of variable transmission lenses may be required.  Characterization over time shall be required for these products, and test temperature may vary.   <br>  <br> 1.   The switching time and associated response curve (as it relates to the light transmittance of the product) over time shall be characterized.  Testing shall be conducted at 68 F ( 10 F), or as specified by customer, on three samples.  Temperature at which the test is conducted shall be recorded for reporting purposes.   <br>  <br> 2.  For slower transitioning products, such as photochromic lenses, the visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded in the clear state (t0).  Once clear state measurements are completed, samples shall be exposed to a solar simulator (with xenon arc lamp) to transition the lens to its dark state.  The behavior of the device under test shall be monitored and recorded at least every second as it transitions from the clear to dark state, and the response curve plotted over time, until the device has stabilized (at least two minutes) (t1).  The visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded at t1.  The solar simulator shall then be removed and the device allowed to return to its clear state.  The behavior of the device under test shall be monitored and recorded at least every second for the first five minutes, then at least every 5 minutes thereafter, as the device transitions from the dark to clear state, and the response curve plotted over time (at least 30 minutes).    The visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded in the clear state (t30).  Transmittance data shall cover the range from 380 to 780nm.   <br>  <br> 3.  For faster transitioning products, such as electronically switchable technologies, the visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded in the clearest state (t0).  Once clear state measurements are completed, the device shall be switched to its darkest state.  The behavior of the device under test shall be monitored and recorded at least every 10th of a second as it transitions from the clear to dark state, and the response curve plotted over time, until the device has stabilized (t1).  The visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded at t1.  The device shall then be switched back to its clearest state.  The behavior of the device under test shall be monitored and recorded at least every 10th of a second as it transitions from the dark to clear state, and the response curve plotted over time, until the device has stabilized (t2).  The visible light transmittance of the device shall be measured, plotted (transmittance vs. wavelength) and recorded in the clear state (t2).  Transmittance data shall cover the range from 380 to 780nm.   <br>  <br> 4.  All recorded transmittance values, and times to transition from clear to dark states (and vice versa) shall be included as part of the report.  Chromaticity and neutrality values for each state shall also be included.  A graph of the transition behavior that allows the transmittance of the device at any given point in time to be easily identified shall be provided for each graph depicting transition from clear-to-dark and from dark-to clear states.  Based on the data collected for each graph, a table that depicts percent transmittance (in increments of 5%) and the time taken to reach that transmittance level shall be provided (with the initial clear or dark state recorded as 0 seconds).  A description of the test apparatus, equipment name/manufacture/models used, block diagram of the test setup, and test procedures followed, shall also be included. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation for a Firm-fixed-price Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) service contract, with a thirty-six (36) month ordering period, to perform testing of eye protection devices.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards. <br>  <br> A Performance Work Statement will be available when the solicitaation is posted on the Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Natick Contracting Division website at https://www3.natick.army.mil . Paper copies will not be available. Once a solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to visit these sites frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. There is no anticipated datr for release of a solicitation at this time. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database in order to be eligible for award. <br>  <br> Interested parties responding to this sources sought request shall submit the following information at a minimum: <br> (a) A positive statement of interest to submit a proposal as a prime contractor on a future solicitation for this service;  <br> (b) Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number and Cage Code;  <br> (c) Provide a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone Small Business or 8(a) firm (if applicable), and a statement regarding small business designation and status (if applicable); <br> (d) Description of test facilities to include: verification that the necessary equipment and personnel are on hand, and equipment is calibrated and operable; environmental controls are in place to ensure all tests are performed in a standard atmosphere of 68 F ( 10 F) and 50% ( 10%) relative humidity (unless otherwise specified in the test methodology); location of test equipment (it is desired that all testing be performed at one location to mitigate logistics and minimize travel associated with tests the Government may wish to witness).  <br> (e) Evidence that the company is accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) or equivalent for conducting testing in accordance with ANSI Z87.1. <br> (f) Evidence of at least three (3) recent and relevant experiences for work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, percent of work performed, description of work performed (to include military specifications, purchase descriptions, and/or military test requirements tested to, for eyewear), and points of contact with current telephone numbers.  Experience shall be specifically for testing of protective eyewear spectacle and goggle products in accordance with US military contracts, specifications, and/or purchase descriptions for protective eyewear.     <br>  <br> This is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business/small business sources prior to final determination of the method of acquisition and issuance of an award. Interested parties should indicate interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing as early as possible, but no later than 3:30PM EDT on Friday, June 7, 2013. Electronic submissions are required. Submit electronic copies to stephen.s.abate.civ@mail.mil . <br>  <br> This market research is for informational and planning purposes only. The Government will not pay any costs for responses submitted. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a contractor not being considered as an interested party. All service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to respond. Upon review of industry response to this sources sought synopsis, the Government will determine whether set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest. <br>

<DESC><p>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability and capability of small businesses or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. product of a small business animal cage manufacturer. However, the Government will consider responses from large vendors as well. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332999 - All Other Miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing; Small Business Size standard is 750 in numbers of employees.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Division of Neurotoxicology, Jefferson, AR requirement for Stainless Steel Cages to house 40 Squirrel Monkeys, which will be purchased under a separate, future solicitation.</p>
<p>Under the theme of enhancing product safety, in collaboration with the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), NCTR will develop animal laboratories for the study of biological processes associated with the behavioral pharmacology of tobacco and related products including nicotine and nicotine-like chemicals. Among other activities, these laboratories will study the constituents of tobacco products that may affect the reinforcing properties of nicotine as they pertain to nicotine's ability to initiate and/or maintain self-administration and vice versa. Towards this end, direct use, non-capitalized scientific equipment animal housing and testing apparatus will need to be procured. More specifically, the Government will purchase equipment and supplies to support 40 nonhuman primate (NHP) Squirrel Monkey (Saimiri Sciureus) species for nicotine self-administration studies. Prior to obtaining research primate subjects, adequate and compliant caging must be obtained.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The NCTR Division of Neurotoxicology has the need of obtaining appropriate direct use, scientific equipment via animal caging-housing space for 40 NHPs. Animal caging required is such as that outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, or its' associated caging equipment to support upwards to 40 NHP Group 1 (up to 1.5 kg) species individuals. The species of choice will be Squirrel Monkeys, (Saimiri Sciureus). This division requires at least 3.2 square feet (floor area) and at least 30 inches tall (height from cage floor to cage ceiling)/76 cm (height) per monkey.</p>
<p>The Government will employ 2 over 2 minimum cage specifications with modular interlocking capabilities between units. The preferred total width for the 2 over 2 unit is between 40" and 44" (101.6 to 111.8 cm), such that five connected units would require between 200" and 220" of wall space.<br /><br />In order to use cages for both singly or pair housed animals, and to allow singly housed animals to have some access to each other, self-storing and/or integrated horizontal panels with three options are needed:</p>
<p>&bull; Solid (no contact with animal in adjoining cage) <br />&bull; Partly mesh and/or barred (allow for grooming contact with animal in adjoining cage)<br />&bull; Partly open (complete access to either side by an animal)</p>
<p>Additionally, the enclosure caging should comply with, and provide ability for addition of enrichment means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Enrichment devices may include perches, swings, mirrors, or other increased cage complexities at our discretion to stimulate forging or task-oriented feeding behavior and all the while providing interaction with the care giver or other familiar and knowledgeable person.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:</p>
<p>Based upon advice from experts that were consulted during our due diligence efforts to establish tobacco-product relevant behavioral pharmacology laboratories at NCTR, and in consultation with staff from NCTR's Veterinary Services Division, appropriate NHP animal housing, feeding and enrichment equipment will be identified and purchased. Considerations of the unique characteristics of the Squirrel Monkey species Siamiri, thus influencing our caging choice are that the species Locomotes on all four limbs (use both vertical and horizontal space). They use their tail for balance and perch rather than sit like other primate species such as our in house Rhesus Macaque. Their perches should be round in shape instead of flat shelves or twin bar to avoid the development of pressure sores on the tail. Additional considerations are that perches should be positioned at multiple levels to maximize three-dimensional use of space within caging environment. Given that they live in large groups (20-200 animals) in the wild, but that these large groups generally have a ratio of one male per 10-20 females, in captivity group housing of males should be limited to two males per group. Finally, cages should provide the ability to attach and/or introduce enrichment devices (e.g., forage board or puzzle board, etc.) to cage front as desirable to include swings, moving perches, or objects hanging within the cage, such as plastic chain or looped PVC tube.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics (Minimum Cage Specifications):</p>
<p>&bull; At least 3.2 square feet (floor area)<br />&bull; At least 30 inches tall (height from cage floor to cage ceiling)<br />&bull; 2 over 2 with the following specifications <br />o Modular interlocking capabilities <br />o Self-storing and/or integrated horizontal panels with three options:<br />&#61607; Solid (no contact with animal in adjoining cage) <br />&#61607; Partly mesh and/or barred (allow for grooming contact with animal in adjoining cage)<br />&#61607; Partly open (complete access to either side by an animal)<br />o Panels dividing upper and lower cages shall be partly removable and/or adjustable to allow vertical access between cage compartments for exercise or pair housing<br />o Exterior measurements that do not exceed 44" in width <br />&bull; Stainless steel<br />&bull; Casters that are 1 piece (no parts glued in)<br />&bull; Squeeze back <br />&bull; Two perches (preferably located at different heights) on two different cage walls <br />o Pull bar mechanism for a squeeze back may serve as one perch <br />o Perches shall be rounded and not be flat shelves<br />&bull; Fixed panels shall not be solid panels (barred or mesh for light and visibility)<br />&bull; Bar at top of cage for hanging enrichment items (e.g., hanging plastic chains, etc.)<br />&bull; Front panel shall include access for a pole and leash system, feeders, card holder, water bottle holders<br />o Ability to attach and/or introduce enrichment devices (e.g., forage board or puzzle board, etc.) to cage front is desirable <br />&bull; Guillotine style door with complete swing out capability<br />&bull; Cage lock mechanism <br />&bull; Rear drainage pans</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>120 days or less after receipt of purchase order. Timely delivery is important to keep the overall study timeline on track and understanding it's the critical path to our separate requirement for the purchase and delivery Squirrel Monkeys.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought notice shall, at a minimum, provide capability statements to include current in-house capability and capacity to meet this requirement and a list of three prior completed projects of the same nature within the past three (3) years, including date(s) of sale, description, dollar value, client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of contact mailing address, client point of contact phone number, and client point of contact email address.</p>
<p>Respondents shall indicate DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), VOSDB, HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code identified in this notice.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government recommends and would appreciate vendors providing a "no obligation" cost estimate for the above referenced requirements for "information purposes" only.</p>
<p>The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response.</p>

<CONTACT>Steven McDonald, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-450-4678, Email steven.mcdonald@mda.mil - Cassandra Pendergraft, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-313-9928, Email cassandra.pendergraft@mda.mil
<DESC><p>1 Objective<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is conducting market research to identify and support development of concepts for a common kill vehicle technology program for the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This research will support identification of applicable technology and concepts as well as qualified parties capable of developing and producing modular and scalable kill vehicles and component or subsystem technology applicable to the Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) and current or future versions of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) missile. This request for information (RFI) does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor should you construe it to be a commitment by the Government. Participation is strictly voluntary, and participants will bear all costs associated with responding to this RFI. White Papers submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned</p>
<p>The MDA is developing a phased approach to acquire common kill vehicle technology with the goal of establishing commonality among both GBI and SM-3 variants. There may be a significant benefit to modular and scalable technology that improves capability and maximizes the commonality among future interceptor kill vehicles. Some of these benefits may include reduced development, production, and maintenance costs. Interested parties should submit a white paper that demonstrates expertise in developing kill vehicles and kill vehicle technology. Additionally, interested parties should submit descriptions of candidate kill vehicle concepts and kill vehicle technology that could achieve the MDA vision as described in paragraph 3. The MDA will review your responses to determine industry's experience designing, integrating, and producing exo-atmospheric kill vehicles and experience applicable to designing, integrating, and producing modular and scalable technology.</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any future formal request for proposal. Information received in response to this request may be used by the Missile Defense Agency for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. MDA will not critique the responses to this notice.</p>
<p>2 Background<br />The mission of the MDA is to protect the homeland, our friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.</p>
<p>In accomplishing this mission, the MDA has fielded a missile defense system that engages and destroys intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile threats in the midcourse phase. The current system relies on interceptors that use the kinetic energy from a direct hit to destroy the incoming ballistic missile threat. The interceptors' kill vehicles track the warhead and maneuver to collide with it. This hit-to-kill technology has been proven in a number of successful flight tests across multiple weapon system platforms.</p>
<p>3 Vision<br />The MDA requests industry input to identify qualified exo-atmospheric kill vehicle developers that can develop kill vehicle concepts that could share components, algorithms, software, interfaces and/or standards in part or in whole for all exo-atmospheric missions. Responses should include a description of a phased approach for specific kill vehicle development, integration, test, and production experience and capabilities of proposed concepts. MDA requests that industry submit descriptions of candidate kill vehicle concepts and component and subsystem technology. Concepts and technology for multiple object kill on a single interceptor are highly desired. Also, describe the maturity of identified technology including previously conducted tests or demonstrations. Provide recommendations and schedules/timelines for key demonstrations necessary to transition to a kill vehicle product development program. Approaches to conducting 36-48 month kill vehicle prototype technology demonstrations (e.g., simulation, hardware in the loop, captive carry, hover testing) are also desired.</p>
<p>RFI responders are urged to describe their experience, capabilities, and candidate technology or concepts to address the following attributes and approaches:<br />&bull; Modular, open and upgradeable architectures<br />&bull; Long-range seekers and advanced sensors (e.g., small aperture seekers, discriminating sensors to address complex threats and countermeasures)<br />&bull; Lightweight, miniaturized avionics<br />&bull; Novel propulsion technology and techniques<br />&bull; Lightweight structures and mini-kill vehicle dispenser system<br />&bull; Lethality improvements<br />&bull; Continuous communications with the Ballistic Missile Defense System and KV-KV communications<br />&bull; Shipboard compliant propulsion (both solid and liquid)<br />&bull; Leak mitigation systems <br />&bull; Algorithms for engagement management and formation flying of multiple kill vehicles, discrimination, guidance, navigation, and control<br />&bull; Address manufacturability, high tolerance to supply chain variability, affordability, reliability, suitability, maintainability, testability and operational effectiveness <br />&bull; Affordability in terms of potential unit cost savings expected from proposed KV concepts <br />&bull; Modeling and simulation tools and capability<br />&bull; Draft development schedule/timeline</p>
<p>4 Instructions<br />Interested respondents will require facility clearances of no less than "SECRET," and all employees will be citizens of the U.S. or lawful permanent residents.</p>
<p>Address questions concerning this RFI via e-mail or in writing to:</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Eulerian cradle to support the measurement capability of BT-4 in the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) user facility. The system will be sited in the NCNR a resource accessible to researchers in the NCNR and to outside users via collaboration to measure a wide range of physical properties of materials.
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a Physical Measurement System. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The Eulerian cradle is a device that, when combined with existing sample-positioning instrumentation, will constitute a "4-circle" goniometer. Compared to typical goniometers in use at the NCNR, a 4-circle goniometer has the advantage that the entire angular range is accessible, and angles can be adjusted independently. The NCNR will use a cryostat or cryocooler in conjunction with the Eulerian cradle. In addition to the cradle itself, the NCNR requires a cryostat carrier with an x-y-z translation stage, as well as a video camera and scope to use for optical alignment of the sample. The measurement system shall meet the following minimum requirements.</p>
<p>1) Load (weight) capacity: 15kg minimum</p>
<p>2) Sample orientation axes must be motorized and must operate independently. That is, if the chi circle is rotated, the phi circle is not and vice versa.</p>
<p>3) An XYZ cryostat holder must be provided so that it is possible to mount a cryostat or cryocooler on the Eulerian cradle, such as the Huber 512.12 or similar.</p>
<p>4) The Outer Diameter of the Chi circle of the Eulerian Cradle should be less than 21 inches.</p>
<p>5) Angular travel range:<br />Phi circle: 360 degrees.<br />Chi circle: 360 degrees.</p>
<p>6) Angular accuracy: <br />30 arc seconds on both the phi and chi circles.</p>
<p>7) Repeatability: 30 arc seconds on both the phi and chi circles.</p>
<p>8) Backlash: 15 arc seconds on both the phi and chi circles maximum.</p>
<p>9) Angular resolution: 0.001 degrees or smaller.</p>
<p>10) Sphere of confusion [mm] with a load of 10kg: .02 mm</p>
<p>11) Compatibility with existing sample positioning devices:<br />Huber 1000 series goniometer heads should fit on the goniometer head support of the phi circle to allow for compatibility with the existing heads and future systems.</p>
<p>12) A scope must be provided, which can be mounted on the Eulerian cradle, such as the Huber 512.12 or similar for optical alignment of the sample. Furthermore, a video camera should be provided, which will attach to the scope and provide output which can be read by a computer.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture an Eulerian cradle are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to joni.laster@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are identified are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an automated loadlock upgrade for an existing Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tool to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The sputtering tool is sited and used in the CNST NanoFab as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the automated loadlock that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The NIST CNST NanoFab operates a Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tool to deposit thin films of various metals and insulators. It is a heavily subscribed by the NanoFab users. In its present condition, each user must spend an average of 60 minutes to perform one sputtering run. Of these 60 minutes, 45 are required to pump the chamber down from atmospheric pressure to the required 4 x 10-4 Pa (3 x 10-6 Torr) after loading the wafer. These 45 minutes can be reduced to 10 minutes by upgrading the tool with an automated loading chamber ("loadlock") system allowing the main chamber to remain under high vacuum during sample insertions, thus reducing the total run time from 60 to 25 minutes. The upgrade shall enable the operator to load a wafer without breaking the vacuum in the sputter tool chamber, and through software control automatically evacuate the loadlock, open an intra-chamber gate valve, transfer the wafer to the sputter tool, retract the loadlock manipulator, close the gate valve, and commence a pre-programmed sputter deposition process. After the process is completed, the loadlock system shall automatically return the wafer to the loadlock for removal by the user. This upgrade will more than double the throughput of this tool and thereby increase both productivity and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION: <br />a. The loadlock system shall upgrade a Denton Vacuum Discovery-550 sputtering tool.<br />b. The loadlock shall mate to an existing size-10 CF-flanged port on the sputtering tool (flange outer diameter 254 mm, nominal tube diameter 203 mm, bolt circle 232 mm, 24 bolt holes).<br />c. The loadlock shall be equipped with a motorized manipulator arm to transfer a wafer placed on a carrier plate into and out of the sputtering chamber.<br />d. The transfer sequences and sputter deposition process shall be completely automatic and consist of the following steps: pump down the loadlock to a suitable transfer pressure; open the gate valve; transfer the wafer carrier plate into the sputter chamber using a motorized manipulator; retract the loadlock manipulator; close the gate valve; pump down the sputter chamber to its base pressure; run the sputter deposition process; open the gate valve, transfer the carrier plate back into the loadlock; close the gate valve; and vent the loadlock to atmospheric pressure.<br />e. The loadlock and transfer mechanism shall be compatible with the existing sputtering tool features, including wafer heating to 400 &#8304;C, carrier plate rotation, and wafer RF bias.</p>
<p>2. CONSTRUCTION:<br />a. The loadlock chamber shall be made of electro-polished 304L-series stainless steel.</p>
<p>3. WAFER TRANSFER:<br />a. The loadlock shall be capable of accepting and transferring one wafer at a time, with wafer diameters of 75 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm. Wafers shall be transferred by means of a carrier plate fitting the existing rotating platform in the sputter chamber.</p>
<p>4. PUMPING SYSTEM:<br />a. The loadlock chamber shall be capable of reaching a vacuum of 6.6 Pa (5 x10-2 Torr) in &le; 5 minutes.<br />b. The loadlock may make use of the existing pumps on the sputter system.<br />c. The loadlock shall be equipped with the following:<br />i. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic high vacuum gate valve between the loadlock chamber and the sputter chamber;<br />ii. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic roughing valve to the loadlock chamber;<br />iii. Computer-controlled, electro-pneumatic vent valve;<br />iv. Vacuum gauge on the loadlock chamber interfaced to the sputter tool system controller; and<br />v. A quick-access-type loadlock door with viewport (minimum diameter 50 mm).</p>
<p>5. SOFTWARE: <br />a. The loadlock software shall integrate seamlessly with the existing sputtering tool software and the programmable logic controller.<br />b. The software shall be capable of an automated, unattended process sequence as described in section 1.d above from wafer-in to wafer-out.<br />c. The software shall provide the following options:<br />i. Manual operation of loadlock and sputter tool;<br />ii. Automatic operation of loadlock and sputter tool: auto-pump, auto-vent and auto-deposition;<br />iii. Operation of the sputter tool without use of the loadlock; and<br />iv. Abort button to stop any process step.</p>
<p>6. TRAINING: The vendor shall provide on-site operation and maintenance training following installation.</p>
<p>7. DELIVERY and INSTALLATION: The delivery and installation of the system in the CNST NanoFab clean room shall be completed in less than 3 months ARO.</p>

<a href="mailto:hilary.o.meckel@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Kansas City</a>
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT.    <br> This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. <br>  <br> 1.	 Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the spillway gates at Harlan County Lake's Dam.   It is anticipated that no more than 2 to 3 gates will be rehabilitated in a contract. <br>  <br> 2.	Dam Location and Description. Harlan County Dam is located on the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near Alma, NE. The dam was built in the early 1950's as part of a flood control/irrigation project.  The dam is combined earth-rolled embankment and concrete gravity dam. The concrete section includes a controlled spillway regulated by 18 Tainter Gates, 9 sluice gates and two irrigation outlets. The Tainter gates are 40 feet wide and 30 feet high and located between piers located 48 feet on center. The existing piers are constructed of an 8 feet wide section above the spillway weir. The piers resist forces imposed by the water and Tainter gates under various water levels and gate configurations. The piers also carry loads from the bridge that spans between the piers. The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck. <br>  <br> 3.	 Project Description.  The work in this project will consist of strengthening structural steel components of the gate, replacing the existing trunnion and bearing with new components, replace tainter gate chain, repair or replace electrical systems, and blast and paint the gate.  Challenging components to the contract are access to the gate, shoring of the gate, and installation of major mechanical and structural components. <br>  <br> 4.	Access.  The ogee of the spillway at Harlan County is steep.  The reservoir will be regulated by the sluice gates during gate modifications, indicating an appreciable tailwater will be present.  The bridge across the dam cannot be permanently closed during construction and has limited capacity (see paragraph 5).  It is anticipated that shoring the tainter gate and replacing the trunnion will occur from accessing the downstream side.  Partially filling the stilling basin with gravel for crane access may be acceptable.  Other means submitted by the Contractor will be considered. <br>  <br> 5.	Bridge.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur. <br>  <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only as defined by FAR 15.201. The purpose of the posting is to ascertain the breadth of interest and capability of the marketplace to fulfill a specific need.

<DESC>Contract Number - R13PX60223
Project Number - Not Applicable
Treasury Account Symbol - 14 0680
Limited Availability of the Justification - As stipulated in FAR 6.001, contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of Part 13 are exempt from the policies and procedures to promote full and open competition in the acquisition process.  As such the Contracting Office is only making the J&A publically available at the Government Point of Entry for 30 days.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation No.: R13PS60223 Project Name: Operation and Maintenance Services; Jamestown Dam and Reservoir
In accordance with FAR 6.302, the proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)( 1).
1. Agency and Contracting Activity - Requiring Agency:  Bureau of Reclamation, Dakotas Area Office, 304 East Broadway, Bismarck, ND 58501 Contracting Activity:   Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Regional Office, 316 North 26th, Billings, Montana 59101
2. Nature/Description of Action - The proposed sole source action is for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) effort for operation and maintenance services using FY2013 funds at Jamestown Dam and for certain land management activities along Jamestown Reservoir with Stutsman County, North Dakota.
3. Description of Supplies/Services - Reclamation is responsible for the operation and maintenance of Jamestown Dam and for certain land management activities along Jamestown Reservoir.  Jamestown Dam and Reservoir is located in central North Dakota immediately north of the city of Jamestown in Stutsman County.  Reclamation constructed the dam and reservoir in 1952-1953 as a multi-purpose project for flood control, irrigation, municipal water, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits.  While Reclamation maintains the ultimate responsibility for the operation and maintenance of Jamestown Dam and Reservoir, the Government has delegated some aspects of administration to other Governmental entities.  Stutsman County administers recreation management along the reservoir under a management agreement with Reclamation.  The North Dakota Game & Fish Department administers fish & wildlife management along the reservoir.
Currently, Reclamation has neither the personnel nor the equipment to successfully conduct all required operation and maintenance projects at the dam and along the reservoir.  The required operation and maintenance services that the contractor shall complete on as as-needed basis at Jamestown Dam and Reservoir include:
(1)  Conduct General Dam Site Surveillance Inspections of Jamestown Dam to check for unusual conditions and site security;
(2)  Make Gate Changes for adjusting water releases from Jamestown Reservoir;
(3)  Conduct vegetation control activities on the Jamestown Dam embankment and downstream area by mowing vegetation within specified areas for aesthetics, seepage monitoring, weed control, etc.;
(4)  Assist Reclamation with miscellaneous maintenance activities such as maintaining existing fences and gates for site security and public safety, removing debris from the dam, outlet works, and spillway areas, and performing other miscellaneous maintenance activities; and
(5)  Conduct an existing and ongoing noxious weed control program on the Jamestown Dam embankment, Jamestown Dam downstream area, and on the Jamestown Reservoir lands.
Reclamation will request the contractor to perform the work on an as-needed basis.  The Government will make payment for quantities actually conducted by the contractor and accepted by Reclamation.  Without the timely performance of these services, Reclamation cannot adequately maintain a high-head dam or control noxious weeds on reservoir lands.
Although many agencies and contractors can provide operation and maintenance services, a contractor that has firsthand knowledge of the area, that has attended Reclamation's "Damtender Training," and that has North Dakota State commercial right-of-way applicator certification would be ideal.
4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition - 41 U.S.C. 251(c)(l) - FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications - Although many agencies and contractors can provide operation and maintenance services, the unique nature of the services require a contractor to attend Reclamation's "Damtender Training," and have North Dakota State commercial right-of-way applicator certification.  As such, the proposed source for this action is Stutsman County, North Dakota.
Stutsman County has conducted similar services as requested in past years under Cooperative Agreement No. 9-07-60-06140, under Purchase Order R11PX60304 in 2011, and under Purchase Order R12PX60139 in 2012.  They have continually demonstrated their ability to conduct the activities in a timely and cost effective manner.
Stutsman County is currently the only entity in the geographic area with Reclamation-trained damtenders on staff.  The proposed requirement requires the contractor to conduct general site surveillance inspections of the dam, which check the status of the dam and associated facilities for items such as the temperature inside the control vault, status of downstream access gate closures, activation of the control vault alarm system, and reservoir water levels.  The contractor is also required to make gate changes to adjust water releases from the dam.  Using a contractor without the required damtender training could compromise dam integrity, increase the possibility of a dam failure, and potentially endanger lives.
Additionally, noxious weed control on reservation lands has been and will likely continue to be a significant land management issue and concern.  Stutsman County has the required equipment and experience to mow, spray, and use biological means to control noxious weeds.  Stutsman County personnel are trained in the application of noxious weed control chemicals, have historical knowledge of the location of noxious weeds, and are familiar with access routes over both public and private lands to noxious weed infestations.  Reclamation does not have the personnel, equipment, or other resources to effectively and efficiently conduct noxious weed control monitoring, mapping, and treatment activities on reservoir lands.
6.  Description of efforts made to maximize competition - Reclamation conducted market research to identify available sources.  None of these efforts yielded additional sources capable of completing the Government's requirements.  As such, there is no competition anticipated for the proposed action.  Additionally, the estimated cost of the proposed action is more than the $15,000 threshold for disseminating information.  Therefore, Reclamation will post a "Notice of Intent" to FedBizOpps allowing other sources the opportunity to notify Reclamation of their ability to fully perform the required services.
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost - Pursuant to FAR 12.209 and 13.106-3(a)(2) and assuming one response is received, price reasonableness will be based on market research, historic pricing, current published price lists (such as the "Book Rental Values" for equipment use rates and wage determination rates for personnel rates), and comparison to the Government's Independent Cost Estimate.
8.  Description of Market Research Conducted - The Dakotas Area Office (DKAO) conducted market research on January 24, 2013 and February 19, 2013.  The required services are not available through UNICOR or AbilityOne.  DKAO's Contracting Office consulted GSA schedule 03FAC (Facilities Maintenance and Management Consulting), Category 811 006 (Facilities Maintenance and Management Consulting).  No contractors have the required specialized damtender training and experience to successfully complete this project.  Additionally, he conducted an internet search for the geographic areas of North Dakota and South Dakota. This search did not identify any contractors providing dam tending services.  Finally, the Contacting Officer consulted Reclamation engineers with knowledge of the market.  The engineers did not identify any additional damtender providers.
9.  Any Other Supporting Facts - As previously stated, without the timely performance of these services, Reclamation cannot adequately maintain a high-head dam or control noxious weeds on reservoir lands.
Stutsman County, North Dakota is a governmental non-profit entity that has conducted similar services as requested by Reclamation in past years under Cooperative Agreement No. 9-07-60-06140, under Purchase Order R11PX60304 in 2011, and under Purchase Order R12PX60139 in 2012.  They have continually demonstrated their ability to conduct the activities in a timely and cost effective manner (when compared to equipment use rates, personnel rates and material costs).
10.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition - Stutsman County, North Dakota has unique qualifications, experience, and resources for assisting with O&M activities at Jamestown Dam and on Jamestown Reservoir lands that are not available competitively from private contractors.  As such, Reclamation does not anticipate having a competitive requirement for the above-specified types of work as long as Stutsman County, North Dakota is Reclamation's cooperating entity in the O&M of Jamestown Dam.
Activities beyond the scope of Stutsman County's operations as a managing partner will be open for competition.

<CONTACT>Heather M. Bakos, Contracting Officer, Phone 5712725361, Email heather.bakos@uspto.gov
<DESC><br />Description of Supplies/ Services: <br />The USPTO has established, on the USPTO campus in Alexandria, VA, and through a Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12) a Government-owned and operated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 201-1) compliant system to support the personalization and issuance of smart card identification credentials under HSPD-12.
<p>USPTO's objective is to ensure that the current Card Management System implementation delivers the expected services and security in a reliable and predictable way through preventive maintenance and proactive management.</p>
<p>This requirement is for managed service for the following core HSPD-12 system components: ActivID Card Management System (CMS), and ActivClient Desktops Software. The CMS enables USPTO to securely issue and manage smart cards and digital credentials, as well as securely update credentials on the cards after they have been issued to end-users. ActivClient smart card client software enables USPTO to secure workstations with smart cards while enforcing strong authentication for desktop access and network login.</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source:<br />The USPTO is anticipating that approximately 12,000 employees and contractors will need to be maintained as enrolled and issued credentials through this solution. This HSPD-12 qualified service provider will provide recurring activities focused on maintaining the CMS platform current, installing Hotfixes, and updating the CMS configuration and policies, and testing the system. All activities will be performed in accordance with the USPTO configuration management process.</p>
<p>The current HSPD-12 solution is a Probaris/ActivIdentity solution. Probaris is the primary HSPD-12 solution service provider and previously subcontracted directly to ActivIdentity for the CMS portion of the solution. At the conclusion of the original Probaris HSPD-12 service contract, Probaris would no longer provide the CMS maintenance, but instead has&nbsp;provided the only&nbsp;responsible small-business partner that it has ongoing successful partnerships for CMS support projects, Axiad IDS. The Probaris/Axiad IDS maintenance agreement is required to advance the HSPD-12 project. There will be no transition period available due to security requirements. Axiad IDS already has the required system knowledge and is able to begin maintenance without a break in service. There is no other known vendor with the knowledge, skills, or experience working with this platform with Probaris for the CMS maintenance. The use of any other vendor would create substantial duplication of time and costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253). In fact, the PTAG states while "it is the policy of USPTO to promote competition to the maximum extent possible...USPTO intends to balance these considerations with the program benefits that can be gained from developing a reduced supplier base and building strategic alliances with its suppliers."</p>

These parts are proprietary to Schottel Inc. the manufacturer of the Z-drive units. The part numbers can't be cross referenced because they are internal part numbers.  Without physically taking the transmission shaft and transport worm out, it is impossible to match them to another manufacturer's part. The old parts in the Z-drive unit were destroyed, so they are unable to be dimensioned at this time.  <br>  <br> This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service/supply must respond in writing no later than March 31, 2013 @ 10:00 AM CST. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly demonstrate ability to provide services/supplies outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to Contact person Valerie Marshall, Contract Specialist, Phone: (901) 544-3619, Fax: (901) 544-3710, e-mail: valerie.marshall@usace.army.mil.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17, Olin E. Teague VA Medical Center, Temple, Texas. 
Purchase Request 674-13-2-5169-0010 - (SP) Fuel Spill Clean-up

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition. As part of the Green Environmental Management System (GEMS) program, outside expert consultation is needed from time-to-time to support highly technical environmental issues.  To support the interpretation of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local codes, expert consultation services are required.  

On September 18, 2010, a VA employee identified a diesel odor and observed diesel fuel in the intermittent stream located along the eastern property boundary.  
The VA notified the TCEQ of the release and contracted an environmental service company to abate, contain and remove released diesel fuel and affected soil. The presence of a large number of underground utilities and nearby buildings prevented the removal of all soil impacted by the diesel fuel release.  Additional environmental expertise was requested via contract with Zephyr Environmental to provide consulting, reporting and correspondence to TCEQ. Prior submittals from Zephyr to TCEQ have been acceptable, but additional reporting and testing is required before VA is issued an official "closure" letter. We are requesting  Zephyr Environmental Corporation, Austin Texas (telephone 512.329.5544)  to remain as the environmental contractor to complete the project.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   Central Texas VA requests a service contract to cover the remaining spill clean- up monitoring and regulatory reporting requirements. The proposed awardee is Zephyr Environmental Corporation. 

The investigation and remediation of the diesel fuel spill falls under the jurisdiction of the TCEQ Remediation Division.  These activities are performed in accordance with the Texas Risk Reduction Program (TRRP).  Zephyr has experience with all aspects of this program.  This program requires the following, as necessary:
"	Determine horizontal and vertical extent of contamination
"	Submittal of an Affected Property Assessment Report
"	Submittal of a Remedial Action Plan
"	Conducting remediation, as necessary
"	Submitting a Remedial Action Effectiveness Report, if necessary, summarizing remedial action over a three year period.
"	Submittal of a Remedial Action Completion Report.
Zephyr will continue to provide the CTVHCS with consultation services to complete the  remedial cleanup activities originating from the diesel fuel spill that occurred at the CTVHCS Boiler plant in 2010. The service includes the completion of required permits, reports and correspondence on behalf of CTVHCS to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, within the following timeframes:     

SCHEDULE FOR FUTURE ACTIVITIES
ESTIMATED DATE	ACTIVITY
Due 5/31/2013	Prepare and submit the Remedial Action Plan. 
8/2013	Receive TCEQ comments on the RAP
9/2013	Provide response to RAP comments to TCEQ
10/2013	Receive TCEQ approval to implement RAP
11/2013	Perform First Quarter groundwater monitoring
2014	Perform four quarters of groundwater monitoring
2015	Perform four quarters of groundwater monitoring
2016	Perform three quarters of groundwater monitoring
12/2016	Prepare Remedial Action Effectiveness Report (RAER)
1/2017	Submit RAER
2/2017	Deed record impacted area and submit information to the TCEQ
5/2017	Prepare and submit Remedial Action Completion Report (RACR)
7/2017	Receive comments from the TCEQ on RACR
8/2017	Submit response to comments on RACR to TCEQ
9/2017	Receive approval of RACR

NOTES: 
"	The dates provided above are estimates.  
"	It may be possible to lessen the monitoring or it may be necessary to take a different course of action regarding remediation depending upon the results of the groundwater monitoring.  
"	Upon completion of the three years of groundwater monitoring, Zephyr will prepare a Remedial Action Effectiveness Report (RAER) that will provide the results from the 12 quarters of groundwater monitoring and address whether the monitoring has been effective in determining whether the groundwater has been impacted by the overlying contaminated soil.  
"	This report will be sealed by a Texas registered Professional Geoscientist than has overseen the activities conducted under the requirements of the RAP.

The next step in the remaining process is the submittal of the Remedial Action Plan (RAP) that will be completed utilizing the TRRP form and format for submittal by May 31, 2013 for comment and approval by the TCEQ.  

The period of performance is April 25 2013 to 30 September 2017.

4.	 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (5), as implemented by FAR 6.302.5  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority: As a result of the hazardous substance spill at the VAMC Temple petroleum impacted soil requires clean-up and remediation strategy over a (3) year period.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) gives us 60 days after the completion of the Affected Property Assessment Report (APAR) to complete our Response Action Plan (RAP), which is due no later than May 31, 2013.   Failure to complete the RAP in a timely manner could result in an investigation by the TCEQ and in potential compliance issues under 30 TAC 335.4 General Prohibitions and imposed fines. In order to minimize further damage and penalties imposed by the state from the discharge of hazardous materials, and to comply with TCEQ and OSHA. Zephyr was selected to complete remaining phase of remedial clean-up and monitoring as they were the initial consulting firm contracted in 2010. Significant interest would be compromised by delaying award of this contract to complete emergency requirement. Zephyr has been identified as the only responsible source due to previous procurement history for this requirement. Zephyr is the only contractor who that can provide these services within a specified period of time to meet regulatory rules and standards. Zephyr provided the initial consulting, reporting, and corresponding under VA257-P-0667; however, additional reporting and testing is required. Pre the market research memo, a geoscientist from a competing firm may be reluctant to certify information which they did not previously collect or oversee.  

6.	Description of Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Zephyr current has the required license and permits needed to continue work they also meet state regulation to perform services under this requirement. Zephyr ranked #10 in the category of environmental services firms and #6 of firms with fewer than 100 employees. Companies were ranked by an evaluation of policies, benefits, working environment, and a comprehensive anonymous survey of employees.

 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 187,400.  In accordance with FAR 15.403-(3)(ii)(B) research was conducted to ascertain historical prices paid under comparable terms and conditions by the Government. Price comparison with the historical hourly rate found a 12% increase from previous procurement in 2010 and current 2013 published provided by Zephyr. Current rates were also compared to GSA published price list for similar labor categories and found pricing 15- 18% higher than list prices provided by Zephyr.  Other factors considered were regulatory knowledge, lead time, service availability, history and knowledge of the CTVHCS. Through price evaluation prices are considered to be fair and reasonable. 
	 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted Market research was conducted through SBA Dynamic search and resulted in several companies as possible sources under tool NACIS code 562910. Mitigating factors such as Cost, Procurement Lead Time, Permits/License and possible violations and penalties should VAMC Temple fail to meet state required deadline of May 31, 2013 were considered. With the above considerations taken to account; it has been concluded that it is more advantageous to the government at this time to award to Zephyr.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   Zephyr has been identified as the only responsible source to perform these services within the specified period of time to meet regulatory rules and standards. The initial document of this contract, the Response Action Plan (RAP), is due to the TCEQ by May 31, 2013. 

Zephyr has completed the following parts of this requirement from previous contract awards:

<p>(a) This is a requirements contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule. The quantities of supplies or services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.

<p>2852.223-70 Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (June 1996)</p>
<p>(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a <br />(b) hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, dis- covers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.1. Long-Term<br />Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047,</p>
<p><br />"Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);</p>
<p>b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;</p>
<p>c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:</p>
<p>&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation</p>
<p>d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:</p>
<p>1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 2) Favorable fingerprint results; 3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:</p>
<p>It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:</p>
<p>a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; b. Favorable fingerprint results; c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and d.<br />Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.</p>
<p>A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelvemonth period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.</p>
<p>3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.</p>
<p>a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.</p>
<p>b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.</p>
<p>c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.</p>
<p>d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.</p>
<p>e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br /><br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.</p>
<p>5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.<br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.</p>
<p>3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br /><br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.</p>
<p>5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>

<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (<br />ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are Approximately equal to cost or price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&emsp;<br />PERFORMANCE BASED QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN<br />R/V MANTA CREW SERVICES</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE</p>
<p>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards included in this contract and in subsequent Task Orders issued. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.</p>
<p>2. AUTHORITY</p>
<p>Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E - Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the articles, services, and documentation called for in Task Orders to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to meet the quality standards set forth by the contract and follow-on Task Orders. The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's performance to assure performance is timely, effective and delivering the results specified in the contract or Task Order.</p>
<p>4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES</p>
<p>The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:</p>
<p>Contracting Officer (CO) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)], A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - [Reference Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COR) is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of designation.</p>
<p>5. RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows:</p>
<p>Contracting Officer - The Contracting Officer [as defined in Section G, Clause G.1 1 1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (April 2010)] ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>COR - The COR [as defined in Section G, Clause G.2 1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR) April 2010)] is responsible for technical administration of the project and assures proper Government surveillance of the Contractor's performance. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. While the COR may serve as a direct conduit to provide Government guidance and feedback to the Contractor on technical matters, he or she is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.</p>
<p>6. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p>The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP. In addition to specific instructions that may be mentioned, the appropriate and standardized form that is to be used for documentation of QA surveillance is the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.<br />100% Inspection - This level of inspection shall be accomplished by monitoring and documentation. <br />Periodic Inspection - Periodic inspections shall be conducted if and when specified in individual Task Orders. <br />Random Monitoring - Random monitoring shall be conducted at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Even though the Government, through its COR, will be monitoring the contractor's performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, the Government will use a quality-assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract. The contractor's performance will be evaluated at the end of the Task Order period of performance, contract period or if there is an unsatisfactory report submitted by the COR for any performance problem on the contract. Ratings will be made in two categories.</p>
<p>Satisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate meets the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are minor and offset by outstanding elements of performance within the Standard;</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate fails to meet the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are pervasive;</p>
<p>In general, the work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the contract Task Orders are satisfied, the extent to which the work performed follows the approach found in the Task Order Statement of Work, quality of work, clarity of documentation, timely completion of scheduled tasks, cost control and business relations. At the discretion of the COR or the Contracting Officer or Specialist, other government officials approved by the Contracting Officer or Specialist may be asked to evaluate a particular deliverable or set of deliverables.</p>
<p><br />7. ANALYSIS OF SURVEILLANCE RESULTS</p>
<p>When appropriate, the CO may investigate an event further to determine if all the facts and circumstances surrounding the event were considered in the COR opinions outlined on the forms. The CO will immediately discuss every element receiving a substandard rating with the Contractor to assure that corrective action is promptly initiated. At the end of every contract period, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of his/her surveillance of the Contractor's performance during the previous period. This report will become part of the formal QA documentation. This documentation will be used for the contractor's yearly performance report documenting quality, timeliness of performance, cost control, business relations and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>If the level of performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory for more than one Task Order, the remedies at 52.246-4(e) will be assessed against the Contractor.</p>
<p>8. NON-MONETARY INCENTIVES<br /><br />Incentives are to encourage sustained satisfactory or greater performance. Although not directly monetary in themselves, future business opportunities are impacted by performance. Incentives include 1) opportunity to complete additional Task Orders which are technically more challenging and financially more rewarding 2) positive past performance rating or letter of recommendation and 3) a reduction in task monitoring and reporting.<br /><br />9. DOCUMENTATION</p>
<p>The COR will, in addition to providing documentation to the Contracting Officer, maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government's performance of the quality assurance function, including the originals of all Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms. All such records will be retained for the life of this contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.</p>

<p>9.	JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A.	Statement of Work</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br />As part of USAID Forward reform efforts, the Agency's Policy, Planning, and Learning (PPL) Bureau has revised the way the Agency approaches project design; by taking the lessons of the President's Policy Directive on Development and Secretary's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), USAID is committed to ensuring project design process is informed by evidence and supported by analytic rigor (see Annex 2).  By following a core set of principles (see Annex 3), this improved process aims to help USAID missions implement projects that are more innovative and cost-efficient, helping them to deliver high impact results. During the design phase, projects are expected to:<br />&bull;	Closely link up to relevant country development strategies and priorities;<br />&bull;	Take measurement and evaluation into consideration from the start;<br />&bull;	Establish clear expectations for the impact and outcomes of the project; and<br />&bull;	Keep the ultimate goal of sustainability in mind-projects should have an exit strategy.</p>
<p>The USAID/Liberia Democracy and Governance Office is preparing to design a new project for Elections and Political Processes in accordance with revised agency guidance (see Annex 1) that incorporates the core principles.  The design of this project will be based upon the strategy set forth in the recently-finalized Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) for Liberia.  The USAID/Liberia Democracy and Governance Office is responsible for managing a program with the goal of more effective, accountable and inclusive governance.  The development hypothesis theorizes that achievement of four intermediate results (IRs) will result in the achievement of the DO.  The four IRs are:  (1.1) public resources managed more transparently and accountably; (1.2) improved policies, models and providers increase access to justice; (1.3) strengthened capacity to implement election processes; and (1.4) civil society and media exercise their advocacy and oversight roles.  As USAID/Liberia moves to implement the CDCS the Democracy and Governance Office will rely on this new ADS guidance to design its overall project and conceptualize new activities.</p>
<p>With a portfolio of approximately $38 million per year, the Democracy and Governance Office currently manages multiple democracy and governance activities, spanning numerous sub-sectors such as: elections, economic governance, anticorruption, rule of law, civil society, legislative strengthening, land tenure, and civil society and the media.  As the largest bilateral donor in Liberia, USAID works closely with the Government of Liberia (GOL) and strives to align program priorities with the country's priorities and goals. USAID will support the GOL's efforts to mobilize and effectively manage public resources, combat corruption, facilitate the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in the resolution of disputes, foster constructive political intercourse, and continue to strengthen the electoral process.</p>

<p>Annex 2: Key USAID Definitions<br />ADS 201.3.7 Projects Effective date: 01/17/2012</p>
<p>A "project" is defined as: <br />A set of executed interventions, over an established timeline and budget intended to achieve a discrete development result through resolving an associated problem. It is explicitly linked to the CDCS Results Framework. More succinctly, a project is a collaborative undertaking with a beginning and end, designed to achieve a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Several other terms relate to this definition of project, including "program" and "activity". "Program" is aligned with a CDCS Development Objective and includes all projects and other activities that are associated with a particular DO. "Activity" is a component of a project that contributes to a project purpose. It refers to an award (such as a contract or cooperative agreement), or a component of a project such as policy dialog that may be undertaken directly by Mission staff.</p>
<p>Annex 3: Key USAID Principles for Project Design<br />ADS 201.3.8.5 Additional Principles of Project Design Effective date: 01/17/2012 <br />In addition to the application of the Operational Principles discussed in ADS 200.3.1, there are a number of significant additional principles that apply specifically to the design process as follows: <br />&bull; Apply analytic rigor and utilize the best available evidence: There is always a dynamic tension between the pressure to obligate funds and the time needed for evidence-based project designs. It is essential that project designs not short-change rigorous analysis and the collection of evidence from development experience and lessons learned derived from well documented, rigorous evaluations. In addition to USAID directly producing analytic studies, additional methods for obtaining needed information can be used, such as literature reviews, synthetic analysis of existing knowledge, peer exchange of experimental knowledge, consultations with local thought leaders to elicit local knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>Methods and formats should be matched to available resources and to the knowledge being sought, and should be planned to optimize the analytic gain for the effort and funding available. While lengthy analytic studies will be necessary in some cases, in others, sufficient analyses can be conducted by using interactive formats ranging from face-to-face facilitated workshops to virtual discussions among development experts, and so on.</p>
<p>&bull; Continuous Learning for Adaptive Management: Regardless of the approach to analysis, it should be recognized from the outset that the analytic basis for projects continuously needs to be updated, tested, and upgraded. Project design should therefore incorporate plans to reflect on the evidence underlying project design, assess the implications of divergence between anticipated and unanticipated outcomes, and facilitate reflection, additional analytic work, and course correction during project implementation. Missions that have included a focus or component in their Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) on collaborating, learning, and adapting (CLA) should have a separate implementation plan for operationalizing this component across the Mission portfolio. They should ensure that project designs reflect the projects' relationship to that broader implementation plan.</p>
<p>&bull; Implement review processes appropriate to a project's cost and complexity: In addition to conducting analysis, project designs can also be improved through the use of peer input and peer review. This can take a variety of forms, including having USAID/Washington staff undertake an early knowledge management review to identify lessons from similar projects and programs; having a panel of experts participate in a facilitated project design review session; and seeking design and review participation from experts at partner country institutions, U.S. Government and other donor agencies, think tanks, and universities. In consulting outside USAID, judgment must be used to avoid potential conflicts of interest. At a minimum, all projects must undergo an internal multidisciplinary formal review involving various Mission offices and functions.</p>
<p>&bull; Promote collaboration and mutual accountability among USAID, the partner government and other key stakeholders: In line with the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action, and the principles of USAID Forward, the design process must include the active engagement of partner country governments and civil society, through, for example, joint diagnostic constraints analyses. An explicit assessment of the partner government's capacity and role with regard to project implementation and managing donor resources should also be included. Based on the outcome of that assessment, a decision should be made on the host country's role in the project, and their contribution toward sustainability, including mutual accountability consistent with ADS 220.</p>
<p>&bull; USAID staff must lead in the project design effort: USAID staff should carry out the major steps of the project design process. The designated USAID project design team should oversee the analysis, conceptualization, and detailed design aspects of the project. Collaboration, consultations and peer reviews with experts should be used, but USAID staff should have a leading role. USAID staff should serve as the principal liaison with host government officials and with other donors in establishing project priorities and broad design parameters. Where a Mission does not have appropriately skilled staff resources, they may be available from USAID/Washington, including the Pillar Bureaus, Regional Bureaus and PPL.</p>
<p>&bull; Broaden the range of implementing options to be considered: Use of partner country agreements and systems, local non-governmental and community-based organizations, agreements with Public International Organizations (PIO), and pooled funding arrangements broaden the range of mechanisms beyond USAID-direct contracts and grants awarded to U.S. organizations. Missions should consider mechanisms being pioneered by USAID's Office of Innovation and Development Alliances (IDEA). The choice of implementing mechanisms is one of the most fundamental considerations in the final stage of project design and has clear linkages to the project's sustainability strategy.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

Reference Request for Quoations and Attachment 1 for additional terms and conditions and specifications. <br>  <br> Question and answers to include clarifications as follows: <br>  <br> Question 1: Who is installing the projectors?  Question 2: Are there installation drawings?  Question 3: Could they be referring to DPI's colormax system?  <br>  <br> Answers for 1, 2, and 3: Installation of the projectors are not part of this requirement. Fourteen projectors will be positioned in a semi-circle pattern at a radial distance of 47ft from the center of a 100ft radius hemispherical dome/projection screen. The horizontal spacing between the centerline of each projector/lens will be 13 degrees for a total projection fan or field-of-view (FOV) of 182deg (13deg x 14 = 182 deg). The total required FOV for each projector/channel (which will include the overlapping or blending regions between adjacent projectors) will be 24 feet or 13.75 degrees horizontal x 15 feet or 8.6 degrees vertical when projected on to the 100ft radius spherical projection screen with a projector throw distance of 53ft (100 - 47 = 53ft) from the screen. <br>  <br>  <br> Question 4: To provide a price for color balancing we will need more information: The installation drawing will show us how the projectors are being used which will give us a clear idea of how long the color balance will take.  <br>  <br> Answer 4: As far as color balancing - once the projectors are installed and aligned, we would like for them to be internally color balanced/adjusted (using their built-in color balancing capabilities), to minimize the requirement for external color balancing/corrections which can be accomplished with the image generator software for the entire projection system. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>

NO ANALYSIS OF VIDEO REQUIRED. Drains may contain some water - depends on many factors that vary daily however, it is not likely to be more than a couple of inches. Resolution of video should be high enough to detect issues with the pipes (cracks, holes, buckles, etc.). Should be able to rotate to view multiple angles. Must be able to video record entire lenght of pipe system. Operator must be able to take direction from Reclamation provided on-site inspector.
COMO DAM TOE DRAIN: The pipes connecting all inspection wells are 2- 24" diameter corrugated HDPE.  The lengths between inspection wells are approximately 700 feet, 600 feet, and 405 feet - also must go up-slope for 100 feet.  Those lengths cover all the 2-24" diameter pipe.  All toe drain slopes are 0.005.  The Outfall pipes at 2 of the inspection wells are 1-30" diameter corrugated HDPE.  The lengths of the outfall pipes are approximately 50 feet and 450 feet.  Inspection wells (access points) are 8' diameter concrete barrels with with hinged steel lids; metal ladders and platforms exist in the inspection wells.  There are no bends. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 2-24" means there are 2 (quantity) parallel 24" diameter pipes.  The 405 foot run has access at both ends (8 foot diameter observation wells).  I guess I left off a 100 foot run (2-24" corrugated HDPE); this run only has access from one side (obs. well).  The 700 foot run has access from both sides (obs. wells) as does the 600 foot run.  The 1-30" outfall pipes have access from both ends (obs. well and ground level screened weir box entry), 1, JOB; <BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>CONCONULLY DAM, CONCONULLY, WASHINGTON Video inspections of entire toe drain system.

CONCONULLY DAM TOE DRAIN: The pipe is a 12" diameter, perforated, and asbestos-bonded No. 14 gage CMP.  Total length is 760 feet.  It has  two 45-degree bends (both to the left if facing the entry); one is 40-feet and the other is 660-feet from the entry.  I can't tell from the drawings what the entry access is like; it appears to be at the ground surface near the left abutment (facing downstream). ADDITINAL INFORMATION Can't find any other access points other than the outfall weir box (ground exposure) near left abutment. Also, it's a 12" CMP, not concrete., 1, JOB; <BR><span class="label">LI 003: </span>SALMON LAKE DAM, CONCONULLY, WASHINGTON (1/2 MILE NORTH OF CONCONULLY DAM) Video inspections of entire toe drain system.

Resolution of video should be high enough to detect issues with the pipes (cracks, holes, buckles, etc.). Should be able to rotate to view multiple angles. Must be able to video record entire lenght of pipe system. Operator must be able to take direction from Reclamation provided on-site inspector.
SALMON LAKE DAM TOE DRAIN: The pipe is a 8" diameter, corrugated, and perforated HDPE pipe.  Two pipes combine at an observation well and a 12" diameter corrugated double-wall HDPE pipe discharges to the weir box and outlet channel.  This 12" diameter pipe is approximately 215-feet in length and straight. The right abutment toe drain (8" perforated) is approximately 1,000-feet in length with slight bends.  The left abutment toe drain (8" perforated) is approximately 150-feet in length with a gradual 90-degree bend in the last 25-feet (where it dumps into the observation well).  At the top of each toe drain, a clean-out emerges to the surface.  This clean-out is a non-perforated 8" HDPE pipe that rises at 45-degrees relative to ground surface.  Access at the clean-outs (tops of toe drains), the observation well, and the weir box all seem plausible. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Does have 5 foot diameter observation wells.  The right cleanout (12" diameter ground access) is approximately 310 feet from an obs. well...approximately 310 to the next obs. well...approximately 320 to the final obs well.  Left cleanout same as right and toe drain is approximately 180 feet. Therefore, total 8" toe drain pipe length is approximately 1,120 feet.  12" outfall pipe (collects both right and left toe drains) is approximately 200 feet with an outfall weir box (ground exposure)., 1, JOB; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9eIxSI0wR%2BgOQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html .

<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>(e) Questions concerning payments:</p>
<p>(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.</p>
<p>(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.</p>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>Each of these six work areas include a range of possible technical skills that will be required on future call orders, and for some, especially M&amp;E, the range of skills listed is very wide. Given this breadth of listed technical skills described under the BPA, it is possible that many (and possibly most) vendors will not have all the requisite skills across all six work areas or within some or all of the six work areas. This reality should not discourage vendors from responding individually, nor should it be seen as a signal that small vendors need to work together with a large prime contractor to be recognized by MCC.</p>
<p>From MCC's perspective, the objective of the BPA is to generate a population of known vendors with known areas of expertise and interest. While vendors are free to work together to submit a response to the RFQ on all elements of the six work areas, that is not MCC's primary intent. Instead, MCC encourages vendors to respond individually or in small groups to demonstrate their core competencies on any or all of the six work areas and on any or all of the skills required within each work area. It is not MCC's intention to receive responses from a small number of mega-consortia that cover all areas; rather, MCC is seeking to establish relationships with a broad range of possible future partners. That relationship is expected to be flexible. Vendors that demonstrate core competency in a subset of skills within a work area or within a sub-set of work areas will have the opportunity to respond to future task orders either by building new institutional capacity in skills that were not previously listed or to work together with other vendors that have complementary skills. In other words, individual responses from small vendors that cover only a sub-set of skills or work areas will not preclude those vendors from bidding either individually or collectively on task orders that reach beyond the core competencies listed in their response to the BPA.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />February 12, 2013 (reposted from Nov 2012)</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following contractor's questions.
<p>1. Attenuators values X-2 and X-4 are called out. Is it required or desirable that the two attenuators be able to be used cumulatively to provide a total attenuation value of X-8?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: It is required that the two attenuators be able to cumulatively provide a total X-8 attenuation. The attenuators must be able to be used individually and cumulatively. The statement of work is amended to include the change.</p>
<p>2. No handling equipment for the attenuators was called out. Should a light duty jib crane mounted on a portable (casters) stand be included in the proposal?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes, the contractor is allowed to use a light duty jib crane mounted on portable casters to handle the attenuators. The statement of work is amended to include a light duty jib crane mounted on a portable (casters) stand or equivalent</p>
<p>3. Although not stated in the statement of work, are lockable storage box on casters be required to store the attenuators when not in use? The maximum weight of each attenuator section will be in the order of 25 pounds.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Storage boxes on casters must be provided. They are not required to be lockable. The statement of work is amended to add requiring the use of storage boxes on caster.</p>
<p>4. Can AFFRI offload and load crates skids from a truck? If so what is the maximum weight capacity.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes, AFRRI can offload and load crates skids from a truck. The maximum capacity is 5,000 lbs.</p>
<p>5. Please confirm that the Model 81 can be removed from the site for the attenuator installation.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The Model 81 can be removed from the site for the attenuator installation, assuming the contractor takes control of the Co-60 source. Our license only permits the source to be stored in the Model 81 irradiator. Ideally, the contractor will take possession of the Co-60 source and Model 81 irradiator to perform the required tasks and return the unit and source to AFRRI once the work is complete. Additionally, the contractor will have to provide ALL required equipment for moving the source and Model 81 irradiator.<br /><br />6. We would like a dimensions sketch or photo of the Model 81 device.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The dimensions aren't available at this time but will be posted at a later date.</p>

As part of the evaluation process, contractors will be requested to include a baseline repair parts list with their proposals.  The repair parts list will be the offeror's design sparing strategy for the life of the contract. This list will be used for evaluation purposes. The government will evaluate the contractor's proposed repairs parts list to determine price reasonableness and to ensure the price proposal is not unbalanced. <br>  <br> While an effort has been made to include a comprehensive Repair Parts list in the contract, it is recognized that not all of the necessary Repair Parts have yet been identified.  It is anticipated that those items will be added to the baseline Repair Parts list as they are identified, but in no event will the additional costs associated with those items increase the overall ceiling price of the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract beyond that specified in the documentation supporting the Government's approval to enter into this contract.  The Government will review the Repair Parts list submitted by the contractor and select only those parts that are required for sustainment, not common items or parts that are already in the Government's supply chain. <br>    <br> The tactical power supplies furnish 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32VDC from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.  The tactical power supply can also operate from a 24 VDC storage battery in the battery standby mode.  Full technical details of the tactical power supplies can be found in MIL-PRF-49080 Revision D, dated 17 March 2010, found at: https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=26824.  Notes: 1) Revision D contains new requirements and many differences relative to Revision C; 2) There is an Exceptions to Specifications, dated 30 May 2012, that will be included with the solicitation that updates the Point of Contact and changes the output cable's relationship to the output connector.  These details will be supplied with the future release of the RFP.  The tactical power supplies will be designed to be field maintainable with full instructions included in the Technical Manual.  The tactical power supplies will be required to undergo First Article Testing, will require configuration management control, and undergo periodic production testing.  Details of testing can be found in the aforementioned MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, dated 17 March 2010. <br>  <br> The Government intends to award a five-year ordering period, Firm-Fixed-Price, (FFP), IDIQ type contract as a Full and Open Competition after Exclusion of Sources pursuant to FAR Part 15 for Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U & PP-2953E/U.  This requirement will be conducted on the basis of Small Business Set-Aside with a single contract award in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  Award will be made to the proposal which is determined to be the best value to the Government.  The National Stock Numbers associated with the previous requirement were NSN: 6130-01-522-3494 and NSN: 6130-01-571-2142.  The NSN numbers will change, and new NSN numbers are in process of being assigned for this new acquisition.  The place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility; no contractors will need to have access to Army installations.  The anticipated and/or potential delivery schedule for PP-6224D/U is 100 - 400 units per month until completion, and for PP-2953E/U, an anticipated monthly delivery quantity of 100 - 250 units per month until completion.  Based on future and possible changing Government requirements, shorter lead times, or higher quantities, or concurrent deliveries may be required.  The quantities and lead times will be negotiated for the specific Delivery Order.  The combined delivery quantity of concurrent delivery orders of one or both Tactical Power Supplies is not required to exceed 500 total Power Supplies per month.  The mix of PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U will be determined by the Government 150 days prior to delivery.  The minimum guaranteed order under this contract will be for either fourteen (14) First Article Units, including Testing and Reports, or for an amount not to exceed $250,000, whichever is less.  FOB Point for delivery of the Tactical Power Supplies is FOB Destination.

PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
Two-Phase Design-Build - Lake Pleasant Visitor Center Upgrades 
Solicitation Number:  INR13PS30001
Background:
  The United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), owns the visitor center located at Lake Pleasant Regional Park north of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona.  The visitor center and park are managed by Maricopa County Parks and Recreation.  
  The Lake Pleasant Regional Park Visitor Center is located on a terrace at the western end of New Waddell Dam.  It was constructed in 1990 by Reclamation as an overlook where visitors could observe construction of the new dam.  Professionally designed exhibits featuring prehistoric and historic objects from Reclamation collections were installed inside including a large park map that showed points of interest using a push-button lighting system.
  With the completion of New Waddell Dam in 1993, the visitor center has continued to provide an exceptional opportunity for visitors to be introduced to the diverse resources of the Park.  In the ensuing years, Park staff has added a wide variety of material to complement and enhance the original exhibits. These include brochures and promotional literature, additional exhibits, found objects, live animals, and growing inventory of snacks, beverages, and gift items for sale.  These diverse materials occupy every available space and then some, and offer little in the way of an organized, consistent educational presentation.
  The trend in visitation has been increasing over the years, and in 2009, the Visitor Center hosted nearly 45,000 guests and netted over $41,000 in snack and souvenir sales. Visitation and sales are expected to continue to increase in coming years.
  Twenty years later, the Visitor Center is in great need of refurbishment. 
Project Description:  
  Reclamation has a requirement to evaluate, design, and remodel approximately 2,500 gross square foot visitor center; to refurbish, upgrade and update the centers facilities, interpretive exhibits, and information services.    Water is the one common thread that is woven throughout the history of the park and the surrounding area.  From the earliest prehistoric hunter/gatherers to the present, water has been the key resource for people living in the area. The Vision is to use "water" as the common theme, to highlight the environmental, cultural, engineering (Old Waddell Dam and the New Waddell Dam), natural history, and recreational features of the area. The Goal is to make the visitor center a true "Discovery Center" and a key visitor destination.
  To fulfill the Vision and accomplish the Goal, a variety of issues must be addressed:  utilities need to be upgraded and alternative "Green" solutions should be considered; exhibit, sales, and media areas must be improved, revised and updated; and the existing structure must be used for the upgrade.  
Procurement Approach:
A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $500,000 and $1,000,000.
This requirement will be a competitive, Total Small Business Set-Aside.
The design and construction is expected to last 365 calendar days.
There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures, FAR Part 15, and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fbo.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about March 15, 2013, under Solicitation number INR13PS30001.  Only up to three of the highest qualified offerors selected after evaluation of the Phase One proposals will be invited to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  
The projected award date is on or about August 9, 2013.  All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.  
NOTE: The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore, the responsibility of all interested parties to periodically access the above FBO internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued and to ensure that they have the most current information.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.  
In addition, offerors are required to have a current registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register at https://www.ccr.gov.  Written questions may be submitted to Rosa M. Gmez at rgomez@usbr.gov or by fax at 702-293-8332.  Only written questions will be accepted and addressed.

<DESC><p>1 Objective<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is conducting market research to identify and support development of concepts for a common kill vehicle technology effort for the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This research will support identification of applicable technology and concepts as well as qualified parties capable of developing and producing modular and scalable kill vehicles and component or subsystem technology applicable to the Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) and current or future versions of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) missile. This request for information (RFI) does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor should you construe it to be a commitment by the Government. Participation is strictly voluntary, and participants will bear all costs associated with responding to this RFI. White Papers submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned</p>
<p>The MDA is developing a phased approach to acquire common kill vehicle technology with the goal of establishing commonality among both GBI and SM-3 variants. There may be a significant benefit to modular and scalable technology that improves capability and maximizes the commonality among future interceptor kill vehicles. Some of these benefits may include reduced development, production, and maintenance costs. Interested parties should submit a white paper that demonstrates expertise in developing kill vehicles and kill vehicle technology. Additionally, interested parties should submit descriptions of candidate kill vehicle concepts and kill vehicle technology that could achieve the MDA vision as described in paragraph 3. The MDA will review your responses to determine industry's experience designing, integrating, and producing exo-atmospheric kill vehicles and experience applicable to designing, integrating, and producing modular and scalable technology.</p>
<p>Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any future formal request for proposal. Information received in response to this request may be used by the Missile Defense Agency for acquisition planning and solicitation preparation activities. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. MDA will not critique the responses to this notice.<br />2 Background<br />The mission of the MDA is to protect the homeland, our friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.</p>
<p>In accomplishing this mission, the MDA has fielded a missile defense system that engages and destroys intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile threats in the midcourse phase. The current system relies on interceptors that use the kinetic energy from a direct hit to destroy the incoming ballistic missile threat. The interceptors' kill vehicles track the warhead and maneuver to collide with it. This hit-to-kill technology has been proven in a number of successful flight tests across multiple weapon system platforms.</p>
<p>3 Vision<br />The MDA requests industry input to identify qualified exo-atmospheric kill vehicle developers that can develop kill vehicle concepts that could share components, algorithms, software, interfaces and/or standards in part or in whole for all exo-atmospheric missions. Responses should include a description of a phased approach for specific kill vehicle development, integration, test, and production experience and capabilities of proposed concepts. MDA requests that industry submit descriptions of candidate kill vehicle concepts and component and subsystem technology. Concepts and technology for multiple object kill on a single interceptor are highly desired. Also, describe the maturity of identified technology including previously conducted tests or demonstrations. Provide recommendations and schedules/timelines for key demonstrations necessary to transition to a kill vehicle product development program. Approaches to conducting 36-48 month kill vehicle prototype technology demonstrations (e.g., simulation, hardware in the loop, captive carry, hover testing) are also desired.</p>
<p>RFI responders are urged to describe their experience, capabilities, and candidate technology or concepts to address the following attributes and approaches:<br />&bull; Modular, open and upgradeable architectures<br />&bull; Long-range seekers and advanced sensors (e.g., small aperture seekers, discriminating sensors to address complex threats and countermeasures)<br />&bull; Lightweight, miniaturized avionics<br />&bull; Novel propulsion technology and techniques<br />&bull; Lightweight structures and mini-kill vehicle dispenser system<br />&bull; Lethality improvements<br />&bull; Continuous communications with the Ballistic Missile Defense System and KV-KV communications<br />&bull; Shipboard compliant propulsion (both solid and liquid)<br />&bull; Leak mitigation systems <br />&bull; Algorithms for engagement management and formation flying of multiple kill vehicles, discrimination, guidance, navigation, and control<br />&bull; Address manufacturability, high tolerance to supply chain variability, affordability, reliability, suitability, maintainability, testability and operational effectiveness <br />&bull; Affordability in terms of potential unit cost savings expected from proposed KV concepts <br />&bull; Modeling and simulation tools and capability<br />&bull; Draft development schedule/timeline<br />4 Instructions<br />Interested respondents will require facility clearances of no less than "SECRET," and all employees will be citizens of the U.S. or lawful permanent residents.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), plans to issue a solicitation for helicopter services to support the U.S. Navy's (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office for Integrated Weapon Systems Test and Evaluation (T&E) (PEO IWS 1TE).  The Navy requires two contractor-operated-and-maintained medium lift helicopters to support Navy ship T&E trials.  Helicopter services will primarily be performed off the East and West coasts of the United States using Navy testing ranges in the vicinity of Norfolk, VA and San Diego/Ventura, CA; however, ship trials can require shipping the contract helicopters in transport aircraft to the Hawaiian Islands and U.S. territories such as Guam.  The primary mission for the contractor will be transporting passengers and cargo to and from Navy vessels at sea; therefore, pilots and aircraft will have to comply with pertinent Navy instructions for aircraft operations.  AQD will issue a commercial item solicitation for aircraft services in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and evaluate offers using the best value procedures prescribed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  AQD plans to award either a single Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the entire scope of work but reserves the right to award two separate IDIQ contracts, with one contract being primarily for the East coast and the other contract primarily for the West coast.  However, the Government may order aircraft to perform services anywhere they are needed.  The base contract period will be for one year with four one-year option periods.  This action will be a full-and-open competition and not set-aside under any small business program.  Any resulting contract will be subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965.  The NAICS Code is 481211, Offshore Marine Nonscheduled Charter Passenger Air Transportation, and the small business size standard is $28.0M.  AQD plans to issue the solicitation around May 20, 2013.

<DESC>May 24, 2013 Updated Questions:

Q11:  If a formal solicitation is posted, will the government allow offerors to request additional NDA's after the 27 February 2013 deadline?  Given the magnitude of this procurement, and depending on the TDP's classification requirements, it is expected that company-wide NDA's may be required if a bid decision is made.

A11: Additional TDPs may be request after 27 February 2013. Each individual requiring access (necessary for evaluation of the TDP for the purposes of proposal bidding/planning) will still be required to sign an NDA as per the terms of the NDA. A Company-wide NDA will not be acceptable.


Q12: A RFP was anticipated to be released in March 2013.
 Weve been monitoring FBO but havent seen anything. Did we miss it? Or has it been delayed? If delayed, is there a new timeframe available?

A12: The RFP has not been released yet. The pre-solictation synopsis has been unarchived. The Government intends to release the RFP in June 2013.


Q13: A Prime Contractor has submitted signed NAVSEA NDA(s) and executed DD Form 2345 to SEA02 for approval.  A prospective Prime Contractor Supplier has submitted signed NDA(s) and completed DD Form 2345 to SEA02 for approval.  In response, both parties have received the NAVSEA TDP and may desire to discuss the information contained on the NAVSEA TDP.  
Paragraph (1)(a) states, The Recipient shall not release or disclose this Data to any third party, including any individual within the aforementioned company who have not signed a NDA.  Can the SEA02 approved Prime Contractor and the Supplier discuss the information contained on the NAVSEA TDP or does this action conflict with the NDA requirement, Recipient shall not released or disclose Data to any third party?   The approved Prime Contractor or Supplier can be viewed as a third party in this case.
 
 
A13: If both parties have submitted signed NDA(s), DD Form 2345 and received NAVSEA SEA02 approval for receipt of the TDP, then those parties may discuss the TDP with each other once it is received. However, please note that only those individuals from each party that have received confirmation of an approved NDA, from NAVSEA SEA02, may discuss and/or view the TDP, no individuals within the company without these approvals may discuss and/or view the TDP.


Q14: This question surrounds the termination of the NDA.  Paragraph (7) is clear if not awarded a contract. However, if awarded a contract, does the NDA expire upon award? 
 
A14: Please refer to paragraph (5) of the NDA. "(5) If awarded a contract, the Recipient may retain all TDP data files for the period of contract performance.
 Within 10 days of contract completion the Recipient agrees to permanently delete and remove all TDP data downloaded to any and all EDs, LANs and IDEs.  If not awarded a contract, the Recipient agrees to permanently delete and remove all TDP data downloaded to any and all EDs, LANs and IDEs, no later than 10 calendar days after notification of contract award or from the date of RFP cancellation. In the event the Recipient elects not to propose on solicitation N00024-13-R-5332, the Recipient shall return the TDP to the aforementioned address above in paragraph (4) and permanently delete and remove all TDP data downloaded to any and all EDs, LANs and IDEs, no later than 10 calendar days after solicitation N00024-13-R-5332 closes."

<a href="mailto:hilary.o.meckel@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Kansas City</a>
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT.     <br>  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  <br>    <br>  1.	 Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the spillway gates at Harlan County Lake's Dam.   It is anticipated that no more than 2 to 3 gates will be rehabilitated in a contract.  <br>    <br>  2.	Dam Location and Description. Harlan County Dam is located on the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near Alma, NE. The dam was built in the early 1950's as part of a flood control/irrigation project.  The dam is combined earth-rolled embankment and concrete gravity dam. The concrete section includes a controlled spillway regulated by 18 Tainter Gates, 9 sluice gates and two irrigation outlets. The Tainter gates are 40 feet wide and 30 feet high and located between piers located 48 feet on center. The existing piers are constructed of an 8 feet wide section above the spillway weir. The piers resist forces imposed by the water and Tainter gates under various water levels and gate configurations. The piers also carry loads from the bridge that spans between the piers. The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck.  <br>    <br>  3.	 Project Description.  The work in this project will consist of strengthening structural steel components of the gate, replacing the existing trunnion and bearing with new components, replace tainter gate chain, repair or replace electrical systems, and blast and paint the gate.  Challenging components to the contract are access to the gate, shoring of the gate, and installation of major mechanical and structural components.  <br>    <br>  4.	Access.  The ogee of the spillway at Harlan County is steep.  The reservoir will be regulated by the sluice gates during gate modifications, indicating an appreciable tailwater will be present.  The bridge across the dam cannot be permanently closed during construction and has limited capacity (see paragraph 5).  It is anticipated that shoring the tainter gate and replacing the trunnion will occur from accessing the downstream side.  Partially filling the stilling basin with gravel for crane access may be acceptable.  Other means submitted by the Contractor will be considered.  <br>    <br>  5.	Bridge.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur.  <br>    <br>  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only as defined by FAR 15.201. The purpose of the posting is to ascertain the breadth of interest and capability of the marketplace to fulfill a specific need. This Sources Sought/RFI does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposals (RFP), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), or a promise that any of the aforementioned will be issued in the future. This request does not commit the Government to contract for any services or supplies. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is not seeking quotes, proposals, or bids at this time; nor will USACE accept any of the aforementioned at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred as a result of responding to this Sources Sought/RFI.  <br>    <br>  If a solicitation is released in connection to this requirement, vendors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for an award. Firms can register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov. For further questions or concerns regarding CCR, please contact CCR assistance at (888) 277-2423 Monday through Friday from 08:00 to 18:00 (EST). Potential vendors must also complete their online representations and certifications. To do so requires CCR registration, including an MPIN number. Instructions for the Offeror Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) may be obtained, and required information may be entered at http://orca.bpn.gov.   <br>    <br>  This sources sought notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this notice with a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than January 4, 2013 by 16:00 (CST).

The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck.   <br>      <br>   3.	 Project Description.  The work in this project will consist of strengthening structural steel components of the gate, replacing the existing trunnion and bearing with new components, replace tainter gate chain, repair or replace electrical systems, and blast and paint the gate.  Challenging components to the contract are access to the gate, shoring of the gate, and installation of major mechanical and structural components.   <br>      <br>   4.	Access.  The ogee of the spillway at Harlan County is steep.  The reservoir will be regulated by the sluice gates during gate modifications, indicating an appreciable tailwater will be present.  The bridge across the dam cannot be permanently closed during construction and has limited capacity (see paragraph 5).  It is anticipated that shoring the tainter gate and replacing the trunnion will occur from accessing the downstream side.  Partially filling the stilling basin with gravel for crane access may be acceptable.  Other means submitted by the Contractor will be considered.   <br>      <br>   5.	Bridge.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur.   <br>      <br>   THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).

<DESC>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME. <br> Northern Regional Medical Command (hereafter referred to as NRMC) intends to issue a Request for Agreement Quotation (RFAQ) for the standardization of Vital Signs Monitors on or about May 23, 2013, but the actual issue date for this RFAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days. <br> The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the MTFs in the NRMC Area of Responsibility (AOR) based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value.  The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). As an NRMC-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, best value will determine selection.  It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the NRMC goal of medical materiel standardization that meets institutional requirements.  <br> Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to Vital Signs Monitors that can noninvasively and automatically measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure (NIBP), pulse rate, temperature and oxygen saturation (SpO2)   for adult and pediatric patients over the age of 3 years.    <br> NOTE:  This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DOD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program.  To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens & Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens & Minor.  This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.  Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act.  Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country. <br> Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFAQ is imminent.  Upon issuance of the RFAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	Vendor must provide Vital Signs Monitors which at a minimum can noninvasively and automatically measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure (NIBP), pulse rate, temperature and oxygen saturation (SpO2)   for adult and pediatric patients over the age of 3 years.  <br>    <br>  VITAL SIGNS MONITOR WITH NIBP, PULSE RATE, TEMPERATURE AND SpO2  <br>    <br>  a.	Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands and descriptions) via excel spreadsheet, product catalog and literature in response to this RFAQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in the table above.  <br>  2.	Vendor must provide pricing for each NRMCAOR on the required products above in the FBO Package Worksheet. This information includes: Vendor Part Number (PN) for required items/samples, Manufacturer/Distributor PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, DAPA UOM, QTY in DAPA UOM, DAPA Unit of Packaging (UOP), QTY of DAPA UOM in DAPA UOP, DAPA Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of DAPA UOM in DAPA UOS, UOS proposed DAPA price and UOS proposed Incentive Price, UOM DAPA and Incentive Price. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each required item/sample.  <br>  3.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and the date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number at the time of Phase II, Clinical Performance Evaluation request for samples, will not be considered for continued participation.  <br>  4.	Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the NRMC AOR). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to this RFAQ in Phase I will not be considered for continued participation.  <br>  5.	The selected Vendor(s) of Choice may offer other items beyond the minimum required product line for consideration to be added to the Incentive Agreement. Products must be offered at an Incentive Price discount off of the vendor's DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.  <br>  6.	Vendor must indicate in FBO Package Worksheet, country from which each line item is an end product, in accordance with (IAW) the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.  <br>  7.

<AWARDEE>Continuous Cash Recovery, 130 Moore St.
 , Saint Augustine, FL 32084-4809 US
<DESC>The US Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Procurement Services has awarded a sole source service contract to Continuous Cash Recovery (CCR), a HubZone small business, for a three-month bridge service contract, while the multiple award, multi-year service contracts are still in the acquisition process and review, to avoid a break-in service in support of the Office of Comptroller Financial Office (OCFO). CCR has been processing the financial services in support of OCFO's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) services for the last 12 months. Therefore, sole sourcing this three-month bridge service contract to CCR is more cost-effective and in the best interest of the Government since the standard six months learning curve required is not anticipated. The period of performance for this service contract is for 3,119 hours or three months whichever comes first. The period of performance will begin on June 20, 2013.

<DESC>The proposed new contract action is to procure the WebLogic server application, standard edition - processor perpetual licenses, for use in the Global Command and Control System - Army (GCCS-A). In addition, this proposed contract action includes WebLogic support which enables us to receive patches, upgrades and technical assistance. GCCS-A is a member of the Family of Systems associated with Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J).  GCCS-J provides critical Joint Warfighting eCommand and eControl (C2) capabilities by presenting an integrated, near real-time picture of the battle space for planning and execution of joint military and multinational operations. GCCS-J is used by all nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs) at sites around the world. GCCS-A supports the planning and execution of Army operations at strategic/operational/tactical levels of battle command. The GCCS-A software integrates GCCS-Joint software applications and infrastructure components in additions to Army-developed applications to perform Army specific functions. GCCS-J applications are developed in WebLogic, which is a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) application server for building and deploying enterprise Java Enterprise Edition applications. WebLogic provides infrastructure for transaction management supports and extends Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) security while providing a rich set of security providers that can be customized to deal with different security databases or security policies.
