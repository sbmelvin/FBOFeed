Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) has a requirement to acquire various components, which will be used to support Maritime Special Operations Missions. NSWCPC intends to solicit Para Gear Incorporated 3839 West Oakton, Skokie IL on a sole source basis for ten (10) Talon 3 Harness Containers, four (4) Silhoutte190 Canopies, one (1) Silhouette 230 Canopy, five 950 Silhouette Canopies, five (5) 7-cell PD193R Reserve Canopies, four (4) 7-cell PD176 Reserve Canopies, and one (1) 7-cell PD218 Reserve Canopy.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The items being procured, to ensure operational integrity, must be the same as or compatible with parts and equipment originally manufactured for or specifically incorporated into the 11 Meter Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat  (11M NSW RIB).  The 11M NSW RIB is a high-speed combatant craft used by the Special Boat Teams to support the Maritime Special O! perations mission. The Government does not own the technical data packages or specifications to compete this procurement.  Para Gear is the manufacturer of these items and are the only known company approved by NAVSEA with the specifications and design to meet these requirements.  The items being acquired can only be procured from Para-Gear Incorporated by direction of Naval Special Warfare (NSW).  The items being procured have undergone extensive testing and qualification.  Each part has been tested to perform to rigid requirements as specified by NSW.  Only those articles, which have been successfully tested, are qualified.  The objective of this process is to verify that the system provides acceptable levels of safety and mission critical support throughout the system specific operating range.  The intent of the process is to provide maximum reasonable assurance that the mission can be completed and an accident will not occur.   The equipment being procured, which is manu! factured by Para-Gear Incorporated, are the only items authorized for use with the 11M NSW RIB.  Therefore, to ensure operational capability and compatibility with other RIB components, purchase action must be limited to this manufacturer.  FSC Code:  8340, NAICS: 314912, SBA Size Standard: 500 employees.    A contract will be awarded on the basis of the proposal submitted in response to the RFQ on or about 24 Nov 04.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of Man-Computer Interactive Data Analysis System (McIDAS)Software License and support.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the license and support from The University of Wisconsin as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  This requirement is for the renewal of the McIDAS Annual Membership.  McIDAS is a continually evolving software system that is uniquely tied to an extensive satellite and meteorological database.  The database is integrated with an interactive graphics analysis system that permits the user to match various datasets in time and space and display and analyze them together.  The annual site license provides access for all LaRC personnel to the McIDAS software system, data and services.  The University of Wisconsin is the only organization that provides McIDAS software and the full complement of historical and current satellite data in McIDAS format.	It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 19, 2004.

<DESC>A-Cardiovascular Health Study-Transition Phase.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with University of Washington to maintain core coordinating center support for the Cardiovascular Health Study (data management, data analysis and publication, collection and adjudication of event data) and support for core laboratory and repository functions during the transition period to a study which is fully funded by investigator initiated grants.  In addition to maintaining the study infrastructure and ensuring participant safety and confidentiality, the contractor, through the CHS Steering Committee, will actively recruit investigators (especially new investigators) from within and outside CHS, maintain broad accessibility to data and specimens, and pursue opportunities for collaboration with other non-profit and for-profit organizations. On-going data analysis and publication efforts will continue.  Contract support will decrease annually over the three-year contract period as ancillary studies gradually assume the majority of the core infrastructure costs.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The incumbent contractor, as the CHS Coordinating Center since 1988, has the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for the transition phase of this study.  The CHS Coordinating Center serves as the repository for the vast CHS data set and provides statistical expertise to support CHS and collaborating investigators in its use.  Over the past sixteen years they have acquired a level of familiarity with CHS's operational methods, study variables, and analytical procedures that is needed for making further scientific progress.  Successful study management and timely, thorough analysis and interpretation of study findings is dependent on continued participation of current contractor staff.  Interested respondents must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform these services as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a Request For Proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, has a requirement for a Coordinating Center to Support a Multi-center, Randomized Trial of Lutein/Zeaxanthin and Omega-3 LCPUFAs in Age-Related Macular Degeneration.  The NEI intends to implement Phase III clinical trial on two nutritionally-based preventive interventions for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract in people at risk for developing sight threatening forms of AMD.  The primary objective of this Phase III trial is to determine whether oral supplementation with macular xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) will decrease the progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration compared to placebo as determined by fundus photographs.  The effect of lutein and/or omega-3 LCPUFAs on lens opacity will be measured based on the incidence of cataract surgery.  The contractor will perform three integrated core services: (1) conduct of background research to support aspects of study design, data management and analysis, and manuscript production; (2) development and maintenance of a research infrastructure for recruitment, training, communication, and monitoring of participating Clinical Sites (20 - 100); and (3) development and implementation of research protocols necessary for conduct of the trial.  In addition, the contractor will operate as a hub to manage the integration of resource sharing, system organization, and project monitoring of a reading center, a drug distribution center, a nutrition coordinating center, and a central biochemistry laboratory.
An eight-year, cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated, with award to be made in September 2005.  RFP 260-05-01 will be available on or about December 1, 2004, and will be posted on this website.

<DESC>UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the BAA list general evaluation criteria for white papers and
proposals respectively. In addition to these general criteria, the following criteria will also
be considered. These criteria do not replace the criteria listed in the BAA but will be
taken into consideration as well. These criteria are listed in priority order:
• Is the technology truly revolutionary? Does it represent a major advance over
current technologies? Because of the revolutionary nature of the technology, will
the benefit provided to end users also be revolutionary?
• Is the technology applicable to the widest possible set of homeland security
uses/users? These will include emergency responders (including fire, police,
USAR, EMT), other public safety officers, Coast Guard personnel, and custom
officials and border guards but may be extended to other homeland security
uses/users.
• Is the development risk profile for the technology addressed both qualitatively
and quantitatively?
• Can the proposed program be executed within cost and schedule and with
acceptable risk?
• If a single technology (material/material system) does not address all
requirements, how will those requirements be addressed?

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The purpose of this synopsis modification is to revise the Government Furnished Property provided to the winning contractor, change the estimated release date, the type of CW-1181 Domes anticipated, and the response date.   1.) The Government DOES NOT intend to provide a mold as Government Furnished Property as originally indicated because this procurement is for urethane domes.  The mold that we own was originally designed for use on rubber domes. The Government will provide a drill fixture to the contractor, which can be used when manufacturing the CW-1181 Domes.  2.) The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 11/30/2004. 3.) NUWC Division Newport intends to solicit proposals for the production of CW-1181D and CW-1181E Domes.  NUWC anticipates a five year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) supply contract for a maximum of 200 CW-1181D Domes and 200 CW-1181E Domes.  4.) The response date is revised to 01/07/2005.  5.) All other terms and conditions remain the same.
Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site 
http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>Draft STATEMENT OF WORK Detail Tasks The ECMS shall have the ability to:   •	Create electronic folders, which are built and maintained in accordance with a classification scheme;    •	Manage folders, including their documents, records, and metadata;    •	Declare an electronic document as an ORM corporate record and maintain its integrity as an authentic representation of a business action or decision;    •	Search for and retrieve records;  •	Consistently manage the retention and disposition of whole folders and records, retaining what should be kept and disposing of what should not, whether by transfer to another organization or destruction •	Control access to folders and records, and to maintain an auditable track of actions taken on them; •	Provide manageable, usable and robust mechanisms to carry out core ORM functions, capture documents, classify those documents as records and allowing the management of those records; •	Incorporate the functionality of the existing WBTS into the capabilities of the broader ECMS. Record Organization Record Capture, Declaration and Management Electronic documents that are generated or received in the course of ORM business processes originate from both internal and external sources.  The electronic documents may be in various formats, may be produced by different authors; and may be received as single documents and as multiple document files. They may arrive through different communication channels e.g. local area network, wide area network, electronic mail, facsimile, letter post (to be scanned), and at variable arrival rates and volumes. The contractor shall develop a flexible input system to capture documents with good management controls so that these diverse requirements are addressed. The contractor shall develop a system that will ensure electronic documents can be captured, so that they can be declared and stored as electronic records from: •	Standard ORM office applications •	Operating system directory management facilities •	E-mail applications •	Images created by a document scanning system The contractor shall develop a system capable of supporting document capture from new office applications, including open source software, as these are brought into use by ORM. The contractor shall support the capture and declaration of any electronic document that is stored as a single electronic file.  Examples include:  •	XML documents and forms •	word processing documents •	documents produced by text editors •	spreadsheets •	e-mail messages •	e-mail messages with attachments •	e-mail receipts •	encapsulated ‘web pages’, with all components, in a single physical file •	presentations •	desktop publishing documents •	PDF format documents •	document images from a scanning system •	single static images in common formats •	bit-mapped and vector graphics. Declaration Management Search, Display and Presentation The contractor shall provide the capability to search, retrieve, and display classes, folders, and electronic records.  The contractor shall provide the capability to search and display interface via a web browser platform to support the retrieval and display of folders and records, and the subset of folders and record metadata normally available to ORM end users.   The contractor shall provide the capability to support graphical browsing of the classification scheme, and browsing directly from a class to the folders created under that class; and the direct selection, retrieval and display of electronic folders and their contents through this mechanism.  The contractor shall provide a search system that is capable of: •	Searching all records management metadata elements;  •	searching the full-text content of electronic records;  •	searching both metadata and record content through an integrated interface; •	constructing searches by combining multiple terms, from multiple sources; •	defining and storing saved searches for reuse by end users;  •	retrieving a complete electronic folder and all its parts and records; and •	displaying a list of all or designated parts and records in the context of that folder as a discrete group and in a single retrieval process. Display Presentation The contractor shall provide the capability for the presentation of folder metadata, records and record metadata to a destination external to the ECMS, in a form suitable for electronic publication.  The contractor shall provide the capability for the presentation of folder metadata, records, and record metadata to a destination external to the ECMS, in a form suitable for electronic publication.  The contractor shall provide the capability for presenting classes, folders and records in one or more of the following formats: •	an XML format suitable for publication •	a non-proprietary HTML format suitable for publication •	an e-GIF approved format suitable for publication. The contractor shall provide the capability for allowing an e-mail retrieved by browsing or searching to be copied to a compatible e-mail application, for transmission in a manner normally achieved by that application. Retention and Disposal A fundamental aspect of records management is the use of retention schedules to govern the removal of records from operational systems. Retention schedules define how long the records have to be kept by the ECMS, and how they should be disposed. The contractor shall provide a function that specifies retention schedules, automates reporting and destruction actions, and provides integrated facilities for exporting records and metadata. Review Transfer, Export and Destruction Access Control Audit An audit trail is a record of actions taken that involves the ECMS. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the ECMS as a result of system parameters.  The audit trail for records can be viewed as metadata of the records (because it consists of information describing some aspects of the records’ history), though this is not essential.  The ECMS must be capable of management and control of electronic records according to the standards necessary for compliance with requirements for legal admissibility and security, and must be capable of demonstrating this compliance. The audit trail is a key factor in meeting these requirements by maintaining a complete record of all the actions on every record. The ECMS must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about:  •	all the actions that are taken upon an electronic record, electronic file or classification scheme; •	the user initiating and or carrying out the action; •	the date and time of the event. The contractor shall provide the capability that once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the ECMS must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about the events.  The contractor shall provide the capability to maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at a minimum for the life of the electronic records or electronic files to which it refers. Backup and Recovery Reporting The contractor shall provide flexible reporting facilities for the Administrator.  The contractor shall include, at a minimum, the ability to report the following: •	numbers of files, volumes and records; •	transaction statistics for files, volumes and records; •	activity reports by user. The contractor shall provide the capability for Administrators to query and produce reports on the audit trail. These reports must include, at a minimum, reporting based on selected: •	classes; •	files; •	volumes; •	records; •	users; •	time periods. The contractor shall provide the capability for Administrators to enquire on and produce audit trail reports based on selected: •	security categories; •	user groups; •	other metadata. The contractor shall provide the capability to produce a report listing of files and volumes, structured to reflect the classification scheme, for all or part of the classification scheme.   The contractor shall provide the capability to include features for sorting and selecting report information.  The contractor shall provide the capability to include features for totaling and summarizing report information. The contractor shall provide the capability to allow Administrators to request regular periodic reports and ad-hoc reports. The contractor shall provide the capability to allow Administrators to restrict users’ access to selected reports. Usability The contactor shall follow the accepted standard rules for the user interface of each operating system or platform for which it is supplied  (for example, a Windows-based version of an ECMS should follow Microsoft Official Guidelines for User Interface Developers and Designers) •	follow consistently present user interface menus, commands and other facilities in all parts of the ECMS application.  •	use consistent terminology to label functions and actions in all parts of the ECMS application. •	Be consistent with the e-government guidelines for web design where a web browser interface is employed for the ECMS. Authentication and Encryption The contractor shall provide the capability to retain the information relating to electronic signatures, encryption and details of related verification agencies. The contractor shall provide a structure that permits the easy introduction of different electronic signature technologies and that provides the following capabilities:  (a)	validity checking of an electronic signature; (b)	retention and preservation as metadata, details about the verification process for an electronic signature, including: •	the fact that the validity of the signature was checked; •	the Certification Authority with which the signature has been validated; •	the date and time that the checking occurred. (c)	validity checking of an electronic signature at the time of capture of the record; (d)	features that allow the integrity of records bearing electronic signatures to be maintained (and to prove it has been maintained), even though an Administrator has changed some of its metadata, but not the content of the record, after the electronic signature was applied of the record; (e)	storing the following with the electronic record: •	the electronic signature(s) associated with that record; •	the digital certificate(s) verifying the signature; •	any confirming counter-signatures appended by the certification authority in such a way that they are capable of being retrieved in conjunction with the record, and without prejudicing the integrity of a private key. Document Management  Hybrid and Physical Folder Management The contractor shall provide the capability to support the management of physical folders in a manner that is closely integrated with the management of electronic folders and electronic records. Design and Performance The contractor shall provide robust and flexible open architecture that can evolve to meet the needs of a changing ORM environment, appropriate to the types of implementation for which the ECMS is intended. Integrity The contractor shall enforce data integrity, referential integrity and relational integrity at all times. Disaster recovery The contractor shall provide the capability for automated and manual back-up and recovery facilities for all classes, folders, records, metadata, audit trails and configuration settings held in the ECMS, either provided by the ECMS itself or by facilities in its environment with which it can interface. Storage The contractor shall provide facilities for monitoring storage facilities, and automatically alert an Administrator when a capacity threshold is reached, or when an error condition requiring attention occurs. Performance The contractor shall provide evidence of adequate performance and response times for commonly performed functions under the normal operating conditions for which it is intended. A benchmark for normal operating conditions is: •	75% of the user population actively using the system •	total record volume to be expected after 5 years use stored •	multiple, concurrent and representative active use of system functionality Scalability The contractor shall provide evidence of the degree of scalability that it can support over time, as ORM’s organizational needs change and develop. System Platform  ORM is in the process of migrating to a Microsoft Server 2003 platform.  The ECMS designed and developed and implemented by the contractor shall be compatible with the Microsoft Server 2003 platform.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for:  Integration of Gravity-Insensitive Heat Pump System JSC is developing heat rejection systems that may one day be used on exploration vehicles or planetary bases.  A vapor compression heat pump system is currently being tested as part of this development program.  The current heat pump being tested is made up of commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and while the system was developed to simulate the function of a heat pump to be used in space, the compressor selected is only suitable for ground-based systems and must be oriented properly in order to function.   JSC has issued a related RFI (Microgravity-Capable Refrigerant Compressor) to identify potential microgravity- capable compressors.  JSC is looking for expertise in integrating the selected microgravity-capable compressor and appropriate evaporator and condenser into a heat pump system that will function under all gravity levels from 0 to 1-g.  This would involve sizing, selecting or manufacturing the heat pump condenser, evaporator, and other related heat pump hardware necessary for a gravity-insensitive heat pump that is capable of absorbing approximately 15 kW of heat at the evaporator at a temperature of 40 F, with a heat pump lift of 90 F (difference between the evaporator and condenser saturation temperatures).  The system should be designed so that the orientation with respect to gravity can be changed to measure the gravity dependence of the system. Tasks would involve analysis; ground testing and hardware integration of a prototypic aerospace heat pump system, but flight certification would not be expected. Contractors with this kind of expertise are invited to submit their credentials and a list of previous relevant projects. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of less than 7 pages indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; number of employees; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); and point of contact - address and phone number).	 Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Keith Hutto no later than November 22, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for: Microgravity-Capable Refrigerant Compressor; JSC is developing heat rejection systems that may one day be used on exploration vehicles or planetary bases.  A vapor compression heat pump system is currently being tested as part of this development program.  The current heat pump being tested is made up of commercial off-the-shelf hardware, and while the system was developed to simulate the function of a heat pump to be used in space, the compressor selected is only suitable for ground-based systems and must be oriented properly in order to function.   JSC is interested in determining if there are commercially available off-the-shelf or custom-built compressor candidates that would not only provide the necessary refrigerant conditions for the heat pump, but also perform this in a microgravity environment.  This compressor would also be expected to operate in partial gravity (such as the moon or Mars) and in Earth’s gravity environment.  It is the goal of JSC to integrate such a compressor into a heat pump system similar to the current setup, and determine by testing in different orientations whether or not the compressor would function independent of gravity.  Information is requested regarding potential gravity-insensitive compressors that could be integrated into a heat pump which is absorbing approximately 15 kW of heat at an evaporator temperature of 40 F, with a temperature lift of approximately 90 F (difference between the evaporator and condenser saturation temperatures).	Refrigerant type is flexible, however it is noted that the current heat pump being tested at JSC operates using R-134a.  The compressor design life should be 35,000 hours or more.   It is believed that for efficient heat pump system operation, the compressor needs to be capable of variable speed operation down to 20 or 30% of full speed.  If a motor controller is available with the unit, please describe its characteristics separately, or the requirements for an external motor and controller to drive the compressor. There is not a specific maximum power requirement or voltage requirement or mass or volume requirement, but this information is solicited and the more efficient it is, the better candidate it is.  Information about control of the compressor and any built in safety features is also desired. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references and capabilities statement.  Please limit the capability statement to less than 7 pages.   Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned, and point of contact - (address and phone number).

<DESC>NA TITLE: "Job Analysis and Training Manual for Pesticide Applicators Seeking Initial Certification to Apply Fumigants to Mediums other than Soil" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify small and/or small disadvantaged businesses that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide technical support in the evaluation and development of training materials for EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs.   Background EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for approving programs to certify pesticide applicators as competent.  Generally, this is done through delegation of the program to a state lead agency, whereby applicators are required to pass a core exam, followed by a category exam.  While most categories differ significantly between states, standards of competency for fumigation of mediums other than soil is inherently similar throughout the country.  In order to promote consistency in training throughout the country, the EPA is committed to developing training materials on fumigation to be distributed to the states for use in their certification and training programs. Additionally, the EPA agrees with and supports the recommendations of the Certification and Training Assessment Group (CTAG), and is committed to producing verified training and testing materials.  Valid examinations are legally defensible, give reliable results and provide a solid foundation for certification and licensing.  A valid exam is developed by using measurement standards [established by the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME)].   The process begins with the development of a job analysis, which is then used to develop a valid exam and manual.  While the cost of producing materials and exams using this method is initially higher, the defensibility of the exam and the high caliber training manual are valuable in the long-term and ensure a higher percentage of those certified are truly competent. During the pesticide re-registration process for the active ingredients Aluminum (Al) and Magnesium (Mg) Phosphide, EPA noted its concern regarding the toxicity of the chemicals and the need for clear guidance in the form of training materials to prepare users of these fumigants.  The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between EPA and registrants of Al and MG phosphide calls for cooperation between registrants and "representatives of EPA, USDA, academia, the states and the user community in the development of training modules and validated certification examination questions that can be used by the states in their Certification and Training programs." General Scope of Work EPA seeks to establish a contractual relationship to meet the terms set forth in the MOA and to provide states with adequate materials to ensure competent applicators are certified to use fumigants. The purpose of this contract is to support the Environmental Protection Agency in the evaluation of existing training materials, the development of a job analysis, and the production of a training manual, PowerPoint training tool and video/DVD for pesticide applicators seeking initial certification to apply pesticides in any medium save soil. Other Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated appendices which are posted to the following web-page on or about November 05, 2004: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0510192/index.htm The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.0 million for potential small and small disadvantaged businesses. The potential contract is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed-Price type with an estimated period of performance of one (1)?twelve month Base Period; plus two (2)?twelve month option periods. Any interested small business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested small business concerns who believe they have the capability of providing services as defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within a 15 page limitation.  Responses shall demonstrate capabilities/expertise with consideration to the SOW requirements.  Responses, including the vendor's business status (e.g.  small, small disadvantaged, minority-owned, 8(a), etc) should be mailed to the following:  (1) U.S. POSTAL SERVICE ADDRESS:  U.S. EPA - Ariel Rios Building  ATTN: Dennis James Bushta (Mail Code 3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

<DESC>This synopsis represents Market Research and the Government's attempt to expand the vendor base of an item currently restricted to one source. TACOM-Rock Island is soliciting information from industry. Your participation in this Market Research is vo luntary and at no cost to the Government. The acquisition is for the Nitrogen Intensifier and the Oil Transfer System for the M198 Howitzer. NAICS Code: 333913.  The Nitrogen Intensifier must meet the following requirements. General Description: The Nitrog en Intensifier is used to assist the military in filling the M198 Towed Howitzer recoil mechanism and equilibrator with nitrogen. The intensifier utilizes and intensifies all but 150 PSI of nitrogen from a pressurized supply bottle. It accepts the nitrogen  from the supply source and intensifies the nitrogen source by a hydraulic pump and electric motor. The intensified nitrogen is then forced into the accepting nitrogen vessel of the recoil mechanism or equilibrator. The intensifier shuts down when 150 PSI or less is left in the nitrogen supply bottle or when the desired set upper pressure level is obtained. Specifications: Ambient Temperature not to exceed 110 deg F or be less than 5 deg F during operation. Maximum nitrogen pressure not to exceed 2500 PSI. Maximum hydraulic pressure 2500 PSI. Minimal electrical service to be single phase 115 VAC, 60 HZ, 20 Amps. Low-end pressure switch 150 PSI +/- 50 PSI.  High-end pressure switch 1850 PSI +/- 50 PSI.

Inlet connection - 1/4 inch female quick connect, Outlet connection - 1/4 inch male quick connect.  15 foot nitrogen hose. Hand held on/off pend ant switch. Built in pressure gage. Pressure relief valve set 2100 PSI +/- -50 PSI. Approx weight 170 LBS +/- 5 LBS. Size: approx 20 feet W x 231/2 inch D X 15 inch H. General Description: The Oil Transfer System is for use as an alternative to the M3 Hand  Oil Pump currently used by the military. The system provides .59 GPM of oil for filling oil reservoirs and recoil mechanisms on the M198 Towed Howitzer. It provides pressure up to 2500 PSI and can self-purge its system of air prior to pumping oil. The sys tem accepts oils from pressurized systems through the same line it discharges from and allows oil to flow through a 5 micron high pressure filter in either direction whether it is from a pressurized system or to a pressurized system or reservoir. Specifica tions: .59 GPM oil flow. Manual hand pump backup - .7 cubic inches per cycle. 5 micron oil filter (replaceable) for transferring fluids. Compatible with oil per MIL--PRF-6083. 5 gallon reservoir with sight glass. Indicator gage when 5 micron filter change is required. Self purging to eliminate air.

<SUBJECT>A--EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE – INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
<DESC>EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE – INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Description The National Academy of Public Administration has released a report that recommends NASA modify its technology transfer program to improve the program’s effectiveness.	The report is located on the NASA Exploration Systems Acquisition Portal url:  http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition.html   In light of this report, we are seeking concepts, innovative approaches, and tools that will boost: NASA’s technical strength via infusion of external technology solutions (i.e., “spin-in” of outside technologies into NASA) and U.S. economic strength and public benefits through the transfer of NASA technology to create new products and services (i.e., “spin-out” of NASA technologies into the private/academic sector). The five basic elements of technology transfer at NASA are: (1) identifying/documenting available technologies as well as NASA’s technical needs, (2) evaluating/prioritizing these technologies/needs, (3) protecting NASA’s intellectual property, (4) performing active outreach to find potential partners, and (5) negotiating partnerships.  The five basic elements will still apply under the transformed model, but how we implement those functions will change.  We are seeking concepts, approaches, and tools to enable a more effective and efficient technology transfer program.  NASA is considering a more centralized approach to technology transfer in line with the NAPA recommendations and have developed a concept of how that centralized approach might work.  The concept is described in the white paper “Transformation of NASA’s Approach to Technology Transfer, Making the Most of the Innovative Partnerships Program”, which is located on the NASA Exploration Systems Acquisition Portal url:  http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition.html  This approach may serve as the foundation for NASA’s future approach to technology transfer, but it may also be significantly altered in response to this Request for Information. For this Request for Information, NASA is interested in receiving white papers from all sources that address aspects of technology transfer and the appropriate organizational “transformed” structure and management approach.  Enclosed are the key focus areas, issues and suggested white paper topics.  White papers that examine one or more of the topics are invited.  Papers that address other important aspects in a manner consistent with the information requested below are also welcome.	White papers should be consistent with the January 14, 2004, U.S. Space Exploration Vision.  Innovative approaches are welcome, but should be reasonably achievable.  White papers should address the following Focus Areas and their associated Topics:  Focus Area 1 – Program Management;  Topics: Lessons Learned, Acquisition Strategy, Innovative Approaches, Effectiveness, Teaming Arrangements, Metrics.  Focus Area 2 – Tools and Methods;  Topics:  Innovative Use of Technology Transfer Industry, Low Cost Methods, Web-based Tools, Radically Different Practices, High-tech, Small Business Incubators, Leveraging of Federal, State, & Local Technology Transfer & Economic Development Efforts, Partnership Development, Licensing, Technology Infusion.      All documents should be delivered in electronic format using Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat by no later than 4:30 EST on December 01, 2004.  The white paper should not consist of more than five pages of text and three pages of graphics.  Any submittal that exceeds these page limits will not be reviewed.  All documents shall be delivered electronically to the following location: https://codet.nis.nasa.gov/Windchill/ExplorationPortal/ESRTIPPSubmit/  Each submission will receive an electronic notification of a successful upload.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development.  Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited.  By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which NASA releases and disseminates the information for review.  Review may be performed by multi-disciplined review teams. Review teams may be comprised of Government personnel from NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, other NASA Mission Directorates, NASA Field Centers, and/or other Government agencies.  Moreover, review teams may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information: Mechanisms for Point-of-Care Data Entry in Combat Environments
<DESC>In military healthcare, there is a need to increase the efficiency of data entry into theater source information systems.  Technologies exist that have the potential to allow for streamlined entry of medical encounter information into source systems,  such as voice recognition and the remote detection of individual soldiers vital signs.  Of paramount importance is the ability to capture clinically meaningful data under theater conditions, with the concomitant noise and chaos of a combat environment. The military has already developed highly effective mobile tools to collect data at the point of care, but so far these rely upon entering data into electronic forms, usually via a pen interface or standard keyboard.  In a combat environment, however, situ ations arise when these tools prove inadequate.  In such situations, it is challenging, or even impossible, for the provider to capture any encounter data at all, much less data that is clinically significant.  Therefore, of particular interest here are th e mechanics of data entry  in other words, ways of relieving the burden on the provider as much as possible. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), in concert with the Department of Defense (DoD) Health Affairs, seeks to gain an understanding of what technologies are currently av ailable in the commercial market to meet the need for an innovative method of medical data entry that relieves the burden on care providers operating in combat environments.   Information must be submitted not later than December 10, 2004. Points of Contact: Ms. Jessica Kenyon USAMRMC TATRC (301) 619-7036 kenyon@tatrc.org OR Mr. Mark Jeffrey USAMRMC TATRC (301) 619-7937 Jeffrey@tatrc.org

STATEMENT OF WORK 

Technical Services to Support the Counter Man Portable Air Defense Systems Program

1.	Background

The DHS Under-Secretary of Science and Technology submitted a congressionally mandated program plan to Congress on 22 May 2003 for development and demonstration of an anti-missile device for commercial aircraft.  The major objective of the DHS Counter-Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) program is to migrate military technologies that will best protect commercial airliners from MANPADS. Phase I of this program culminated in preliminary design reviews of the systems.  The primary objective of Phase II is to continue with the development, demonstration, and test of the system prototypes in order to assess the suitability of these systems for commercial applications. 

2.	Scope 

The Contractor shall provide technical experts to assess two Counter Measure (CM) system installation approaches proposed by BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman, in the areas of structural and electrical impact, drag, aircraft interfaces, and design adaptability/universality across Boeing’s commercial fleet.  A Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) will be required under Task 1, and the Government may procure subsequent data reports by authorizing Tasks 2, 3 and 4. 

3.	Specific Tasks

The following tasks shall be performed under this Statement of Work (SOW) no later than December 23, 2004:
Task 1:
A)	The Contractor will prepare for the TIM by reviewing the Government-Furnished documents cited in this SOW.
B)	Between November 12, 2004 and the TIM, the Contractor’s technical experts shall prepare presentation slides to identify and discuss high level risks and technical issues with respect to the Counter-MANPADS systems interface on the aircraft types listed within this SOW.  For each of the following topics, the Contractor will cover, within two to four slides, diagrams of the applicable architecture, and highlight any significant technical issues that need to be considered for the design and certification of Counter-MANPADS equipment installations.  “Significant” is defined as any supplemental engineering task or test that would not be evident, or anticipated, having completed only one Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) on one aircraft sub-type.  The topic areas shall be:
i)	Structural fatigue & vibration just forward of the non-constant section.
ii)	Structural interference issues just forward of the non-constant section.
iii)	Power loading/margin on essential and non-essential buses.
iv)	Interface to the aircraft transponder to override the Mode 3A code.
v)	Interface to the master caution warning system to provide missile notification.
vi)	Crew interface at the flight deck.
vii)	Interface to the flight data recorder to provide a discrete missile warning. 
C) 	TIM:
The Contractor shall participate in the TIM from November 30 to December 3, 2004, at Boeing’s Renton 10-16 building, room 72V4.  The intent of the TIM is to identify high level risks and technical issues with respect to airframe and Counter-MANPADS systems interface, considering the B737-300/-800, 747-200/-400, 757-200, 767-200/300, 777-200, & MD80 aircraft types. 
On the first two days of the meeting, the Contractor shall participate in separate one day briefings by BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman on each of their respective systems.  BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman teams will brief Contractor’s technical experts on behalf of DHS for approximately one half of each day.  For the remainder of each day, the Contractor’s technical experts shall present slides on aircraft type and sub-type variations as identified above. 
On the last day and one half, the Contractor shall participate in closed discussions with the Counter-MANPADS SPO to review the following:
i)	Significant risks and technical issues with respect to BAE System’s and Northrop Grumman’s Counter-MANPADS systems interface and installation approach for Phase II.
ii)	Significant risks and technical issues with respect to the installation and certification of Counter-MANPADS systems across the Boeing fleet.
iii)	The Contractor’s cost projections for Counter-MANPADS life cycle costs.
iv)	Contractor, pursuant to a mutual agreement with the Government, shall perform action items resulting from the TIM, and which are within the scope of the SOW. Action items shall be assigned only to obtain and provide additional information and/or clarification on questions regarding the Counter-MANPADS interfaces and/or the Boeing aircrafts.  All action items shall be closed within two weeks following the last day of the TIM.
D)	Government-Furnished Documents to be provided by DHS to Boeing no later than November 12, 2004:
	Items i) through v) are BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman’s documents as provided to the SPO at the preliminary design in July 2004.  As such, these documents may not reflect the current or final design of the system.
i)	Aircraft & Avionics Integration Design Documents (AAIDD)
ii)	Specifications on Line Replaceable Units (LRU) not contained within the pod
iii)	Specifications on the pods with a 3-view drawing
iv)	External Interface Control Documents
v)	FAA Certification Plans
E)	Task 1 Deliverables and Schedules
1A)	Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM)
	Note:  The viewgraph briefing shall be presented to the SPO during the TIM.
Schedule:  November 30-December 03, 2004.
1B)	The following Deliverables shall be delivered to the SPO:
Item:   One (1) each Aircraft STC Design & Cost Matrix.  Its format is to be determined by the Contractor, and it shall summarize significant design or certification risks to the integration, installation and certification of Counter-MANPADS equipment on Boeing aircraft types and sub-types. 
Each significant technical risk and/or issue must have a corresponding Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost projection according to the following categories:
High:	Greater than $10 million
Medium:   Greater than $1 million, but less than $10 million
Low:   	Less than $1 million
The ROM must indicate the level of increased/decreased design and certification effort as compared to the Phase II baseline efforts on the Phase II STCs (B767-300, B747-200 and MD-11).  The objective of this effort is for the Contractor to identify issues (including certification) that needs to be addressed, going from the prototype programs which BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman will complete in Phase II to the US commercial fleet retrofit, and which will identify the ROM for non-recurring cost impact, that would be part of the life cycle cost implications for the fleet.
Schedule:  No later than two (2) weeks following the last day of the TIM. 
Format:  Viewgraph format determined by the Contractor. 
Task 2:
A)	One (1) each Drag and Fuel Economy Report.  This Report shall provide the mission block fuel increase (in percent and in USG per year) for a 1.00% increase in drag, and for a 500 lb increase in operating empty weight (OEW). 
Assumptions will include typical mission rules, payload and load factor, range, trips per year, etc.  An analysis of brochure levels of block fuel required will be provided for these typical missions, as well as for a six-hour mission for the wide body models, and a three-hour mission for the narrow bodies at typical cruise Mach number and altitude.  An analysis of penalties to certified performance (for example, takeoff field length, second segment climb, and/or en-route climb) WILL NOT be provided at this time.  The Report shall include the following aircraft:  Boeing 737-300/-800, Boeing 747-200/-400, Boeing 757-200, Boeing 767-200/-300, Boeing 777-200 and MD-80.  Representative engines should be used.

Amendment 2
Questions and Answers

 
The purpose of this amendment is to answer contractual and technical questions submitted before the specified cutoff date and time of October 29, 2004, 11:00 A.M. EST.  
 
The due date for quotes has not changed.  Quotes must be submitted to Ms. Gena Leake NLT November 5, 2004, 1:00 P.M. EST via e-mail [gena.leake@dcma.mil] or facsimile [(703) 428-3579].  ALL correspondence MUST reference the solicitation number in the subject line.
   
 
QUESTION 1.  Who will provide the actual part/inventory content?  If this is pulled from somewhere will you provide the contractor with the necessary non-technical support to gain permission to interface with desired system?
ANSWER:  The data comes from various Government databases.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to obtain and have all the required data available to fulfill the contract requirements. 
 
QUESTION 2.  The current configuration is licensed to 4 locations in the U.S. (Alexandria, VA; DCMA East - Boston, MA; DCMA West - San Diego, CA; Ft. Belvoir, VA).    
Worldwide access would have a substantial effect on the price of the copywritten data vs. 4 sites in the U.S.   
Can the bidder assume access to be the same as the current configuration?  If not, please tell me the new locations 
ANSWER:  

The current contract does not specify the number of site licenses or specific locations.  While there are overseas locations, the current contract price does not separately identify or price them.  

The following is the current configuration the Government is paying for:

Parts/Logistics - 10 simultaneous users
 
Specs/Standards - 5 simultaneous users
 
Sites:
  DCMA East - Boston, Ma
  DCMA West - Carson, Ca
  DCMA HQ - Alexandria, Va
  
Access is provided to all DCMA users (including overseas locations) via the above sites.
The DCMA overseas sites can be viewed at the following URL:  http://home.dcma.mil/dcmai/places.htm.  You must click on each field office to view the locations supported by each field office.
