It is the Company’s intent to make this procurement a Small Business Set-Aside.  If you do not respond affirmatively to all participation criteria contained in the expression of interest, you will not be eligible for subsequent procurement actions.  After evaluating responses to this EOI the Company will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested to allow for a competitive Small Business Set-Aside procurement.  If so, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications to the qualified small businesses that responded to this EOI.  If it is determined that a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are not available, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications open to small and big businesses.*****

All subcontractor personnel working on this project must be United States citizens.  Offerors must be able to obtain a favorable Foreign Ownership, Control, or Interest (FOCI) determination from the Government in order to be eligible for subcontract award.*****
 

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT & SCOPE OF WORK*****

The project will replace the existing nine compressed air trains located in five different locations at Y-12 with a centralized system to be located in existing building 9767-13.*****

New compressor trains will be provided to produce compressed air that meets the requirements of American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Instrument Society of America (ISA) S7.0.01-1996, “Quality Standard for Instrument Air,” except that the maximum dewpoint allowable will be -40ºF.  Nominal capacity is expected to be in the 12,000- 15,000 scfm range at a pressure sufficient to provide 110 psig air at the using facilities.  The system will be designed in a modular fashion so that capacity can be matched to demand and will include backup equipment.  Design life of new equipment and facilities will be at least 20 years.*****

The new compressed air trains will be installed in Building 9767-13 and will consist of compressors, air dryers, receivers and associated filters, heat exchangers, and interconnecting piping.  An integrated control system will be provided for local operation.  The control system will be connected to the existing Y-12 Utility Management System for monitoring and remote control.  Supporting utilities will include electrical power, cooling water, and brine.  These utilities will be supplied from existing systems which serve Building 9767-13.*****

Some building upgrades are required to meet this project’s required design life.  Existing ventilation systems will be replaced by this project.  A new roof will be put on the building and a new roof access system will be provided to enhance maintenance access.  Cooling tower 9409-13 will also be upgraded; new pumps and control valves and a new sprinkler system will be provided to increase operability and extend design life.  Engineering/Procurement associated with the building upgrades and cooling tower 9409-13 upgrades may be excluded from the E-P subcontract.*****

Surplus equipment/facilities where space is needed to install the new compressed air facilities will be demolished by the project.  Other equipment/facilities that become surplus because of the project will be placed in safe shutdown for disposition by others.*****

Access to Building 9767-13 requires a Q-clearance or a Q-cleared/Personnel Security Assurance Program escort.  All personnel must be United States citizens with assigned identification badges and vehicle passes.*****

The E-P subcontract scope of work consists of Title II and III engineering plus supply of all engineered equipment, including the compressors, air dryers, receivers and associated filters, heat exchangers, motors, electrical switchgear, interconnecting piping and wiring (if required to deliver equipment as packaged units for ease of installation), etc.*****

Deliverables from the E-P subcontractor will include the engineered equipment plus all technical documentation to obtain fixed price construction bids to construct the facilities and install the equipment; to maintain the equipment; and to operate the equipment.*****

Testing Support--Factory testing and checkout of engineered equipment prior to delivery to Y-12 will be provided.  Test, checkout, and startup support for the final installation will be provided (Title III).*****

Quality Control/Quality Assurance--Requirements will be per DOE 414.1A.*****


PROCUREMENT PROCESS*****

BWXT Y-12 intends to award an evaluated competitive fixed price subcontract to the successful offeror that best meets the project’s goals and objectives.  Selection will be based on best-value using a two-phased approach of a Request for Qualifications and a Request for Proposals.  Phase 1 (Request for Qualifications) will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications.  From the responses received, BWXT Y-12 will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to no less than three (3) firms to receive the Request for Proposals.  No pricing is to be included in Phase 1. Notices will be forwarded to offerors upon completion of the SOQ evaluations to inform them if they made the shortlist to receive the RFP.*****

Phase 2 (Request for Proposals) will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Structure & Control, and Socioeconomic and Affirmative Action Plans and provide Pricing.  The basis for award will be the firm offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the SOQs evaluated under the Request for Qualification.  Subcontract award is anticipated in October 2004, but will ultimately depend on the availability of funding.  Award of partial scope of the subcontract may occur if full funding has not been released.*****

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to upgrade the SL-100 telephone system at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC).  This upgrade will be accomplished by the purchase and installation of 4 new Intelligent Peripheral Modules (IPE). Southwestern Bell Communications (SBC) is the only known source for the acquisition and installation of the telephone systems hardware since they are currently on contract with the FAA for maintenance of the SL-100 telephone switch.  SBC will coordinate/provide installation, testing, and documentation of the proposed system.  As the FAA's provider for maintenance, SBC must do the planning and coordination of this hardware upgrade for compatibility with the existing hardware.  The use of a "non-certified" vendor would void the FAA's maintenance agreement on the telephone switch and could cause major telephone outages at the MMAC.

<DESC>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Cancer Insitute (NCI), on behalf of the Synaptic Transmission Unit (STU) of the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) intends on entering into a sole source purchase order with Rapp Optoelectronic GMBH, Gehlenkamp 9A, Hamburg, Germany 22559 for the purchase or a UVILA Complete Turn-Key System with accessories.  The focus of the STU is the characterization of presynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission.  Current projects include measuring the delay between the increase in the calcium current and vesicle fusion, as well as the current associated with the opening of the fusion pore.   In order for the STU to reach its goal, it is necessary to induce a rapid and precisely timed increase in calcium in the cells.  Therefore, the STU at NINDS requires a system which provides a light source to induce exocytosis due to caldium uncaging.  The UVILA system can produce very intense but very brief pulses (a few nanoseconds) of ultraviolet excitation pulses at short intervals (100 milliseconds).  The UVILA system is compatible with NINDS existing FlashMic system also manufactured by Rapp OptoElectronics.  Rapp OptoElectronics is the only source known to the NCI that can provide this system which is compatible with existing government-owned equipment.  However, if any interested parties believes it can provide the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST, (local Washington, D.C. time) on January 7, 2004.  This procurement will be processed based on FAR 12 acquisition of commerical items. If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.

<DESC>Synopsis:

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor to provide items under the general grouping of metals and metal products and ancillary services for the Northeast, Central, and West Regions of the United States. A Prime Vendor, or integrated supplier, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products. The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, copper, brass, titanium, nickel, alloys, and other industrial metals, in several forms, including wire, plate, sheet, strip, bar, angle, extrusion, pipe, tube, valves, fittings, and any other shape required by the ordering activities. The items required under this solicitation are not fixed to a discrete group of NSNs. Rather, requirements may change and expand or contract due to the needs of our customers. Related services such as cutting to size, scrap and salvage metal removal, and technical support will be included in any resultant contract as needed by ordering activities. 
The Northeast Region consists of the following states: Connecticut, Ohio, Delaware, The District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.
The Central Region consists of the following states: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas infrastructure system at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility system being privatized is described as follows: Installation: Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. System Description: Natural Gas.  The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, it has 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units which the Air Force controls. Gila Bend Airfield is 65 miles southwest of Phoenix, AZ. It has 40 buildings and 180,065 square feet, which the Air Force controls. Fort Tuthill is 135 miles north of Phoenix, AZ. It has 31 buildings and 44,119 square feet, which the Air Force controls. At each location, the utilities to be possibly privatized are the natural gas distribution system and the wastewater collection system. Luke Air Force Base has it’s own wastewater treatment plant. Although the systems shall be evaluated individually, privatization shall combine and group as many systems as is feasible under a single RFP. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. Gila Bend Airfield: Three one thousand-gallon propane tanks owned by the propane supplier, Amerigas Inc. supply propane gas to Gila Bend Airfield. The tanks store propane at 100 psig. Propane gas is delivered to the lodge at 12.5 psig, and to the Fire Department at 10 psig. Fort Tuthill Recreation Area: Propane gas is supplied to Ft. tuthill Recreation Area at two each, one thousand-gallon propane tanks owned by the propane supplier, All Star Gas, Inc. The Air Force-owned piping consists of approximately 1250 feet of piping. The tanks store propane at approximately 100 psig. Distribution is at 5 psig. Wastewater collection system: The sanitary sewer system at Luke Air Force Base (AFB) consists of three major components, the sanitary sewer collection system, the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and non-potable water reuse system. The sanitary sewer system consists of the gravity mains, cleanouts, lift stations, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer form the facility buildings and family housing on the base. A majority of the gravity collection mains and service laterals were installed in the 1940’s when the base was first constructed and in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP), the force mains are Cast Iron (CI) and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP).  In the 1970’s, additional base housing was installed. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP), the force mains are Cement Mortar Lined Ductile Iron (DI), and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP). Since the 1980’s, the base has made a concerted effort to install PVC for all sanitary sewer piping of sizes 8-inchesa or less. Consequently, most of the gravity mains, force mains and service laterals in these areas are composed of PVC. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed in the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s are in fair to good condition. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed during the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s are in good to excellent condition. The WWTP is designed to all the sanitary flow from the sanitary sewer collection system through a 21” RCP main gravity line flowing from the site. Major improvements were conducted in 1994 to provide an advanced wastewater treatment plant which consistently met effluent discharge limitations and provided reuse water for discharge to the base golf course and parks for irrigation purposes. Improvements were designed to allow the facility to effectively treat an average daily flow of 1.0 million gallons per day (1.0MGD) with removal efficiencies in excess of 95% or better for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and suspended solids. The WWTP has a certified laboratory capable of performing both process control and process monitoring tests. Since most of the WWTP equipment was installed or reconstructed in the 1994 improvements, its overall condition is good to excellent. Gila Bend Airfield: The sanitary sewer system at Gila Bend Airfield consists of service laterals, cleanouts, oil/water separators, lift stations, gravity mains, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer from the facility buildings on the base. The collected sanitary wastewater is transferred to a central treatment system that was installed in 1970. The gravity collection system consists of primarily Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP) mains with VCP or Cast Iron Pipe (CIP) laterals. Approximately 90% of the system was installed in the 1970’s. In the 1990’s, a small portion of the original mains and laterals were replaced with Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) piping. The treatment system consists of a manually cleaned bar screen, influent Parshall flume and four lagoons designed for 125,000 gallons per day. The treatment system has an NPDES permit and is permitted for discharge. Lagoons No.1 and No.2 have liners that require repairs; however, Lagoon No.3 and Lagoon No.4 do not have liners. Fort Tuthill Recreation Area: The sanitary sewer system at Fort Tuthill Recreation Area consists of service laterals, cleanouts, lift stations, gravity mains, junction boxes and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewage. The collected sanitary wastewater is transferred to a central septic system, which was installed in the 1960’s. The gravity collection system consists of primarily Vitrified Clay Pipe (VCP) mains with VCP or Cast Iron Pipe (CIP) laterals with Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) mains and laterals installed in later additions. The treatment system consists of a lift station, a 20,000-gallon storage tank, septic tank and lateral field designed for 12,000 gallons per day. The lift station contains a wet well, two (2) pumps, float type level controls and a control panel with a Hand-Off-Auto switch for local manual pump control. In 1996, the pumps were replaced with new submersible grinder pumps. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Synopsis
This is a Corrected Pre-Solicitation Notice. Please note that the solicitation number has been corrected to N62472-03-R-0101 and that the estimated date for the Request For Proposal package availability has been changed to January 09, 2004. Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, "Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns". This solicitation will result in award of the Multiple Award Construction Contract - III (MACC-III). The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder. The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods. A set maximum amount has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year. The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000. Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $15,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered. Future task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors. Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price. Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects. Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required. All key professional disciplines shall be registered. The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and the ability to do design build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts. Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts. The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast's 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed. The Government reserves the right to award up to five contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System, NAICS, Code of 236220, and the small business size standard is $28.5 million are applicable to the seed project. Award of the seed project will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to this solicitation, is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government as a result of a Best Value evaluation with price and technical evaluation factors being approximately equal in importance. Two-phase design-build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The evaluation factors under Phase-One may include the following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications, 4) Commitment to Small Business Concerns, and 5) Safety Record. Offerors will be required to provide information for both their construction team, as well as their design team under these factors. Based on its evaluation of the Phase One, the DON will invite up to eight (8) offerors judged best qualified for this MACC-III, as well as, the seed project, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), Naval Academy Prep School (NAPS), Naval Station Newport, RI, to participate in Phase-Two. Offerors selected to participate in Phase Two will be provided the RFP including technical plans and specifications for the BEQ NAPS, at the Naval Station Newport, RI. Phase Two consists of Price and Technical proposals. The seed project will also be evaluated as to price reasonableness. It is anticipated that the offeror awarded the seed project will meet the minimum guaranteed amount. Phase Two technical proposals may include the following factors: 1) The Overall Aggregate Technical Rating Received for Phase One; 2) Technical Approach to Seed Project; and 3) Seed Project Management Plan. The maximum value of this contract will be $100 million over the 4 years of contract performance.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Sources Sought. The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) is seeking sources of technologies suitable for transitioning/integrating existing logistics management systems into the future Naval Logistics Command and Control (NLC2) concept. NLC2 involves real time tracking/management of logistics from the manufacturer and management of that logistics on a Sea Base. In particular, interest is focused on the architecture and functionality of a Sea based Naval Logistics Command and Control with integration of a Ground Logistics Command and Control (GLC2) component system with respect to Sea Power 21. The NLC2 must operate the logistics tail to support Sea Power 21 concepts of Sea Basing, Sea Strike, and Sea Shield operations within a ForceNet network centric warfare communications system architecture within the concept of the Global Information Grid (GIG) that will provide the information that enables knowledge-based real time operations.  The logistics component must provide a wide range of services in addition to real time tracking of fuel, ammunition and water to include maintenance and repair, medical evacuation, medical services and handling of prisoners. These services must be provided and managed by NLC2 in a way that assures that combat forces always have the resources and services when and where they need.  New combat initiatives (e.g. the Expeditionary Strike Force) are aimed at increasing the tempo of battle, maneuverability, and flexibility. Sea Basing requires that materiel needs must be forecast and supplied much more accurately and timelier than for operations of the past. There is a need for the design and implementation of a network architecture that includes standard joint protocols, common data packaging, seamless interoperability, and strengthened security defined in a common architecture or Common Operating Environment (COE).  All information shall be forwarded at no cost to the Government by 30 January 2004.  The preferred method for submitting information is by means of mail (NFESC, Code ESC 32, 1100 23rd Avenue, Port Hueneme, CA 93043-4370).

A U.S. security clearance is a condition of employment.  Contractor personnel shall be required to be United States citizens that possess  Top Secret, Sensitive, Compartmented Intelligence (TS/SCI) clearances and have successfully completed a CI polygraph.    Contractors must be able to administer classified contracts.  This procurement will include tasks necessary to provide the complete range of system testing (integration, installation, infrastructure compliance, operational) services for all DoDIIS SCI intelligence application/tools.  Deliverables will include data in the form of detailed test reports, deployment recommendations, test schedules, test finding justification, configuration management, presentation materials (overheads, briefing aids, etc.), reference guides, revisions to existing Government documents and Interface Control Documents (ICD), white papers, program plans and other general material as required (analysis, plans, schedules).  Responsiveness and timeliness are critical factors for these tasks.  While the majority  of work is accomplished during regular duty hours (7:00am -  5:00pm, M-F), DIA operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.  It is feasible that mission needs may require personnel to work outside of the regular duty hours to facilitate a critical need on an infrequent basis. Successful contractors must be able to provide thorough testing IAW DoDIIS technical standards of approximately 50 tests annually, across multiple operating systems and widely diverse technologies from GOTS and COTS, client server, thick client to thin client and web plug-ins. In addition, contractors must be able to coordinate testing amongst widely dispersed organizations with an extensive inventory of multi-vendor systems.  Contractors must be thoroughly familiar with Department of Defense (DoD) Intelligence Information Systems.  Services that may be required include, but are not limited to, the following: support to joint test planning meetings, Pre-test software evaluations, test plan development and coordination, test scheduling,  integration, installation, infrastructure and operational testing, detailed test report generation, findings management, test bed and software configuration management, statistics management, briefing generation and presentation for multi-vendor, diverse technology systems, system upgrades and enhancements.  DIA requires a contractor support cadre of highly skilled systems testers, analysts, engineers, and application specialists to handle a myriad of issues related to the architecture, integration implementation and operation of a complex and diverse set of systems and networks.  Such personnel need to be experts and certified in the Microsoft NT and Solaris/Trusted Solaris operating systems.  Applications to be supported include a variety of databases, Microsoft Office products, Netscape, Lotus Domino/Notes, and many other GOTS and COTS products.  In view of the special security requirements for this program, the successful vendor will have developed and put into practice a process to handle all aspects of classified contracting.  This includes support in contract administration and pricing. The successful vendor must be able to demonstrate the process by which classified contracts are handled to provide services.  Cleared and experienced individuals must be trained and in place prior to any contract awards to carry out this process in various departments within the vendor's organization. Submissions should be limited to five pages and should be pertinent and specific to the technical areas under consideration for this procurement.  Submissions should include the following qualifications:  (1) Experience - an outline of previous applicable projects and specific work previously performed or being performed;  (2) Personnel - name, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who will provide the services listed above.  Knowledge gained through training may be considered.  Include any other specific and pertinent information pertaining to this proposed procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Vendors interested in participating in this Sources Sought announcement are requested to contact Ms. Kara Byrd (202) 231-4419 at the Defense Intelligence Agency; Attn: DS-CIO LCM; Bldg. 6000; Bolling AFB; Washington, D.C.  20340-5100 no later than January 7, 2004, or sooner if possible, to be included in the above planned meeting.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking sources with the capabilities to perform in-depth quantitative benefit-cost analyses of individual technology development projects and aggregates of projects funded by the Advanced Technology Program since its inception in 1990. *** Quantitative benefit-cost case studies are a foundation of ATP assessment of project outcomes and impacts in the longer term.  They have become instrumental in NIST-level budget documents and financial reporting as well as ATP reports to various stakeholders.  OMB, in particular, expects to see return on investment results, and has increased its expectations for “retrospective” analyses of benefits actually realized by the program to date, as compared with “prospective” analyses, as time has passed.  The utility of these studies depends on consistency and clarity of analysis and on the communication and presentation of complex concepts and results to a lay audience. *** Addressing the multi-faceted mission of the Advanced Technology Program “to accelerate the development of innovative technologies of broad public benefit undertaken through partnerships with the private sector”, studies will identify and quantify technical accomplishments, quantify private and public benefits and costs, and identify broader, less quantifiable impacts on industrial innovation and societal impact.   State-of-the art analysis techniques are expected to include traditional cash flow analysis directed at private and social rate of return measures and/or other approaches such as macroeconomic modeling, simulation, or econometrics, as appropriate.  Emphasis will be on ATP projects where the period of ATP funding has ended and commercialization has begun. *** Some task orders are anticipated to require a team approach, or a network of experts, encompassing specifically, scientist, economist, and/or financial market expertise.  Others may emphasize development of training modules or convening of workshops to explore issues in benefit-cost analysis techniques applied to early stage technology development projects undertaken by industry with private-public funding. *** Examples of studies currently being considered (not exhaustive) include the following: *** (1) Case studies of a single project, a cluster of similar technologies or applications, or a group of projects under an ATP focused program.  Studies will involve quantitative analysis of benefits and costs from product or process technologies.  Such studies will emphasize projects where the ATP-funded technology development phase is complete, and commercialization has begun.

SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS The intent of the System of Systems is to provide a common operating picture encompassing the functional areas of installation management including, but not limited to, electrical and water distribution, sewage and storm systems, data and voice communicati ons systems, HVAC and gas lines, real property inventory and management, space utilization, master planning, environmental management, force protection, training, mobilization and contingency operations planning/execution.  The system will provide installa tion and higher headquarters staff support using and integrating several industry-standard geographic information and CAD systems, and leveraging analytical toolsets already developed at local sites.   The end-state vision incorporates elements of ACSIMÃ¢Â€Â™s GIS-R, PAROÃ¢Â€Â™s PRISMS/MC2, and Corps of Engineers CAD data and expertise into a single source portal supporting master planning and staff decision processes.   System will provide a secure vehi cle (whereby user and group permissions control access appropriate to the userÃ¢Â€Â™s needs, protecting data and Ã¢Â€Âœneed to knowÃ¢Â€Â to appropriate levels) for web delivery of toolsets, spatial data, and linked information to users according to their authorized level of access.  The system will support master planning, force protection, mobilization, training, budget, environment, public safety, and information technology managers with data across functional lines.  Users will tap factually-assured cur rent data directly from the source of record, with no associated replication costs, using geography as the user interface.  The system must be capable of expansion to include other IMA regions and NETCOM interests.   System will provide a data delivery system that reduces installation staff workloads by linking existing data, decreasing redundant data fields, automating routine reports and time-consuming data gathering activities, reducing requests for information and delivering information to key decision makers.  The data delivery elements of the system must already be in production and providing secure access to users, require no software development costs to the government, and support configuration of system softwa re by end user personnel limited within appropriate installation management functional areas. System will use a unique combination of distributed data warehousing and a graphical mapping interface with a web portal to give authorized users near real-time access to source data.  System will allow functional and headquarters staffs to share informati on from common sources regardless of the format or platform.  System will minimize duplication of databases in order to increase staff effectiveness and speed decision-making processes.  This enterprise tool will provide managers with the factually assured  current data directly from the source, when necessary, with no associated replication costs.   All data received in response to this announcement marked or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions.  This is NO T a Request for Proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or an announcement of a solicitation, and no solicitation package exists.   The sources sought announcement is a request for informational purposes only.  It is a market research tool being used to determine potential and eligible firms capable of providing the System of System described above.  The government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  Vendors having the ca pabilities nec essary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, or their statement of capability to Mrs. Margaret P.

<SUBJECT>A -- Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository
<DESC>PN-RM-04-0001 (Statement of Facts)

The NIMH is seeking public comments (or alternative plans) regarding potential use of a deviation to the standard patent rights clause (FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form), in a contract to be awarded under the NIH Roadmap:  “Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository”.  The proposed clause is included in full text in a separate notice PN-RM-04-0001 (52.227-11 Patent Rights (Deviation)), and also in the solicitation for this contract (RM-04-0001), which can be accessed at: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/grants/indexcon.cfm#RequestforProposal and in the FedBizOpps at: http://vsearch1.eps.gov/servlet/SearchServlet.  Due to file size limitations, the Statement of Facts and the proposed deviation to FAR 52.227-11 could not be published together.

If a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) were implemented, this clause deviation would serve to protect the pre-existing and future patent rights of suppliers of proprietary materials for synthesis or inclusion in the compound collection/repository.  The proposed clause deviation only applies to discoveries resulting from routine synthesis activities and repository activities involving the use of proprietary materials (compounds and procedures).  Discoveries resulting from research activities pertaining to the development or modification of chemical synthesis procedures, process development, or other unanticipated discoveries developed by the contractor without the use of proprietary materials will be covered by the standard Patent Rights Clause (FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997).  Furthermore, the Contractor will have the right to ask for greater rights, as defined in the clause, if the supplier of the proprietary compound is not interested in the subject invention.  

Potential offerors and other interested parties are invited to submit comments herein or provide “alternative plans” when responding to the solicitation for this contract, which would serve to meet the objectives/goals of this Program without the use of this deviation.  All plans and comments will be considered and discussed with interested parties. 

Any comments/plans regarding this clause should be submitted, in writing, by March 2, 2004, to Mr. Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Contract Management Branch, NIMH, NIH, 6001 Executive Blvd., Rm. 8154 (MSC 9661), Bethesda, MD 20892 (for Fed Ex, UPS etc. use Rockville, MD 20852);Voice: (301) 443-2234; Fax: (301) 443-0501; E-Mail: ba9i@nih.gov.  See solicitation for instructions on submission of “alternative plans” with a proposal.

The following Statement of Facts provides more detail into the potential use of a deviated patent rights clause:

Statement of Facts

The primary goal of the Molecular Libraries initiative is to improve public health by stimulating the discovery, development, and commercialization of new research tools and potential therapeutic compounds for the treatment of a variety of disorders and the validation of new targets for drug therapy.  We believe the synthesis and repository activities of this contract may constitute an exceptional circumstance where the imposition of a FAR deviation, through a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), would further the achievement of the programmatic goals and meet the objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200.  Historically, the NIMH has obtained the approval of DECs in similar contract programs where proprietary materials are involved. 
 
To meet the goals and objectives of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, this contract will need to acquire and maintain a library of hundreds of thousands of diverse small molecules, which will become a major resource to investigators for further evaluation in a wide variety of assays of biological activity.  The small molecules collected in this repository will be arrayed and sent to screening centers (i.e. grantees, which are not part of this contract) or investigators, to be evaluated and screened for a large number of possible new activities and applications.  Screening will enhance the identification of small molecules that are useful as research tools (e.g., probes to alter the function of novel proteins or molecular imaging probes) or as starting points for the development of novel compounds with therapeutic potential.  The contractor shall maintain an appropriate quantity of each compound by either repurchasing additional quantities, or through synthesis efforts. Under this contract, both proprietary and non-proprietary materials will be provided directly by the compound suppliers (or through NIH) to the contractor for inclusion in the compound collection/repository.   It is anticipated that some of the most unique and promising compounds with the most interesting biological activities will be proprietary.   Therefore, in order  for this program to succeed, it will be essential to obtain a sufficient flow of proprietary materials.

Our previous experience and discussions with compound suppliers (i.e., investigators at academic institutions, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies) have shown that they will not submit their proprietary materials without complete assurance that their intellectual property rights will be protected, such as that which could be provided through a DEC.  

Through discussions with these organizations it was determined that, except for the protection offered by this clause, the NIH would have no other method to gain access to some of these promising compounds; this would result in a less effective and less diverse and unique compound collection.  As many of the compounds with the most interesting activity will be proprietary, having an insufficient number of these compounds submitted for inclusion in the repository would inhibit the discovery of promising new leads for further development as potential research tools or therapeutics.  This would not appear to appropriately support the objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200, et. seq., or benefit the public health under this program. 

Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly unlikely to invest in areas such as the development of research compounds to be used as research tools, imaging probes, or as therapeutics for rare or ‘orphan’ diseases because of cost-restraints and low potential returns. Therefore, this program will fill a critical need by supporting and stimulating the development of much-needed research tools and potential therapeutics that might not otherwise be developed.  It is expected that many investigators who use the compound collection will go on to further develop these compounds into much-needed agents and therapeutics to further research and benefit the public health.   

We recognize the scientific expertise of the contractors and the importance of the Bayh-Dole Act in protecting the intellectual property rights of contractors.  While Bayh-Dole provides incentives for the commercialization of Government supported research and development by allowing contractors to retain rights to inventions, the Act also permits an exception to this provision under exceptional circumstances. In this instance, we believe that restriction or elimination of the contractor’s right to retain title to subject inventions, in a narrow field, may be needed to further the programmatic goals of research and development in order to benefit public health. 

If adopted, use of the proposed restricted Patent Rights clause has been narrowly tailored to apply only to subject inventions using proprietary materials obtained and evaluated under these contracts, and not to subject inventions outside the scope of the deviated patent rights clause.  The Contractor will have the right to ask for greater rights, as defined in the clause, if the supplier of the proprietary materials is not interested in licensing or pursuing the invention. Furthermore, even if a DEC were implemented, rights to subject inventions made without the use of proprietary materials would remain with the contractor, and will be subject to the standard clause at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997). 

Based on previous experience with similar programs, we have discussed and considered approaches other than the use of a DEC for acquiring and evaluating proprietary materials, but we are not currently aware of any viable alternatives that would adequately address the concerns noted above.

http://vsearch1.eps.gov/servlet/SearchServlet.  Due to file size limitations, the Statement of Facts and the proposed deviation to FAR 52.227-11 could not be published together.

If a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) were implemented, this clause deviation would serve to protect the pre-existing and future patent rights of suppliers of proprietary materials for synthesis or inclusion in the compound collection/repository.  The proposed clause deviation only applies to discoveries resulting from routine synthesis activities and repository activities involving the use of proprietary materials (compounds and procedures).  Discoveries resulting from research activities pertaining to the development or modification of chemical synthesis procedures, process development, or other unanticipated discoveries developed by the contractor without the use of proprietary materials will be covered by the standard Patent Rights Clause (FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997).  Furthermore, the Contractor will have the right to ask for greater rights, as defined in the clause, if the supplier of the proprietary compound is not interested in the subject invention.  

Potential offerors and other interested parties are invited to submit comments herein or provide “alternative plans” when responding to the solicitation for this contract, which would serve to meet the objectives/goals of this Program without the use of this deviation.  All plans and comments will be considered and discussed with interested parties. 

Any comments/plans regarding this clause should be submitted, in writing, by March 2, 2004, to Mr. Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Contract Management Branch, NIMH, NIH, 6001 Executive Blvd., Rm. 8154 (MSC 9661), Bethesda, MD 20892 (for Fed Ex, UPS etc. use Rockville, MD 20852);Voice: (301) 443-2234; Fax: (301) 443-0501; E-Mail: ba9i@nih.gov.  See solicitation for instructions on submission of “alternative plans” with a proposal.

Authority to use the following clause may be sought:

52.227-11	Patent Rights (Deviation)

This clause deviation applies to discoveries resulting from routine synthesis or repository activities involving the use of proprietary materials (compounds and procedures).  Discoveries resulting from research activities pertaining to the development of new assays or the development or modification of chemical synthesis procedures, process development or other unanticipated discoveries developed by the contractor without the use of proprietary materials will be covered by the standard Patent Rights Clause (FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights – Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997)

(a)	Definitions.  (1)  “Invention” means any invention or discovery, which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et, seq.)

(2)	“Made” when used in relation to any invention, means the conception or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.

(3)	“Nonprofit organization” means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statue.

(4)	“Practical application” means to manufacture, in the case of a composition of matter or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method, or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.

(5)	“Small business firm” means a small business concern as defined at section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.  For the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.

(6)	“Subject Invention” for the purpose of this clause, means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in Section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of contract performance.  

(7)	“Compound Suppliers” means any entities or organizations that make available to NIMH  a composition of matter or product, patented or unpatented.

(8)	“NIMH” means the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

(9)	“NIH” means the National Institutes of Health.

(b)	Allocation of principal rights.  (1) Retention of pre-existing rights.  Compound Suppliers shall retain all pre-existing rights to those compounds in which the compound supplier has a proprietary interest.

(2)	Assignment to the NIH or compound supplier.  The contractor agrees to assign to the NIH or to a Compound Supplier designated by NIMH the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention except to the extent that rights are retained by the contractor under subparagraph (b)(3) of this clause and subject to a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to the United States Government to practice or have practiced the subject invention for or on behalf of the United States throughout the world.

(3)	Greater Rights Determinations.  The contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation by the NIMH with the contractor, may request greater rights to an identified subject invention of the contract in accordance with the procedures of FAR paragraph 27.304-1(b) and FAR paragraph 27.304-1(c) (in the case of an employee-inventor) subject to the considerations set forth below.  The NIMH will grant greater rights if the supplier is not interested in developing the invention.  In addition to the considerations set forth in paragraph 27.304-1(b), NIMH will consider whether granting the requested greater rights will interfere with rights of the Government or any Compound Supplier or otherwise impede the ability of the Government or the Compound Supplier to develop and commercialize new compositions of matter, compounds, product designs, dosage forms, therapies, technologies or other approaches for the treatment of mental disorders in a rapid, efficient, and cost-effective manner.  A request for a determination of whether the contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to retain such greater rights must be submitted to the NIMH Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1) below, or not later than eight (8) months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the contractor.  Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of the FAR clause at 52.227-13, and to any reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by NIMH such as the requirement to assign or exclusively license the rights to subject inventions to the Compound supplier.  A determination by NIMH denying a request by the contractor for greater rights in a subject invention may be appealed within 30 days of the date the contractor is notified of the determination to an agency official at a level above the individual who made the determination.  If greater rights are granted, the contractor must file a patent application on the invention.  Upon request, the contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country for which the contractor has retained title.  Upon request, the contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.

(c)	Invention disclosure by contractor.  The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the NIMH Contracting Officer as provided in paragraph (j) within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters.  The disclosure to the NIMH Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s).  It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention.  The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure.  In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor.

(d)	Contractor action to protect the Government’s interest.  (1)   The contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the NIH all instruments necessary to – (i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in subject inventions pursuant to paragraph b.2. above, and (ii) Convey title to the NIH or to a Compound Supplier when requested under paragraph b.2. of this clause and to enable the NIH or a Compound supplier to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.

(2)	 The contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and 
      nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government’s right or a Compound Supplier’s right in the subject inventions.  This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause.  The contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.  The contractor will notify the NIH of any decisions not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.

(3)	 The contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application it files and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the National Institute of Mental Health.  The Government has certain rights in the invention.”

(4)	The contractor agrees to provide a final invention statement and certification prior to the close-out of the contract listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.

(e)	Subcontracts.  (1)  The contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work.  The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the contractor in this clause, and the contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the contract, obtain rights in the subcontractor’s subject inventions.

(2)	In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, NIH, the subcontractor, and the contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and NIH with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of FAR clause 52.227-13 which is incorporated by reference in paragraph b.3 of this clause.

(f)	Reporting on utilization of subject inventions in the event greater rights are granted to the contractor.  The contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the contractor or its licensees or assignees when the NIH has granted a request under subparagraph b.3.  Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the contractor, and such other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify.  The contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the NIH in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the NIH in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.  As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the NIH agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the contractor.

(g)  Preference for United States industry in the event greater rights are granted to the contractor.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States.  However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the NIH upon a showing by the contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

(h)	March-in rights in the event greater rights are granted to the contractor.  The contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title through the exercise of the rights specified in subparagraph (b)(3), the NIH has the right in accordance with the procedures in FAR paragraph 27.304-1 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request the NIH has the right to grant such a license itself if the NIH determines that—

(1)	Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;

(2)	Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;

(3)	Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or

(4)	Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (g) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

(i)  	Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations in the event greater rights are granted to the contractor.  If the contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—

(1)	Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the NIH, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the contractor;

(2)	The contractor will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when the NIH deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e);

(3)	The balance of any royalties or income earned by the contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses, (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and

(4)	It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it ill give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the contractor determines that the small business firm has plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal.  The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the contractor.  However, the contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the contractor’s licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary’s review discloses that the contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph.

(j)	Communications.  All invention disclosures and requests for greater rights shall be sent to the NIMH Contracting Officer.   Additionally, a copy of all disclosures, confirmatory licenses to the Government, face page of the patent applications, waivers and other routine communications should be sent to the Office of Extramural Inventions and Technology Resources Branch, OPERA, National Institutes of Health, Rockledge, II, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 3190, MSC 7750, Bethesda, MD 20892-7750

<SUBJECT>A -- Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository
<DESC>PN-RM-04-0001 (Statement of Facts)

The NIMH is seeking public comments (or alternative plans) regarding potential use of a deviation to the standard patent rights clause (FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form), in a contract to be awarded under the NIH Roadmap:  “Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository”.  The proposed clause is included in full text in a separate notice PN-RM-04-0001 (52.227-11 Patent Rights (Deviation)), and also in the solicitation for this contract (RM-04-0001), which can be accessed at: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/grants/indexcon.cfm#RequestforProposal and in the FedBizOpps at: http://vsearch1.eps.gov/servlet/SearchServlet.  Due to file size limitations, the Statement of Facts and the proposed deviation to FAR 52.227-11 could not be published together.

If a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) were implemented, this clause deviation would serve to protect the pre-existing and future patent rights of suppliers of proprietary materials for synthesis or inclusion in the compound collection/repository.  The proposed clause deviation only applies to discoveries resulting from routine synthesis activities and repository activities involving the use of proprietary materials (compounds and procedures).  Discoveries resulting from research activities pertaining to the development or modification of chemical synthesis procedures, process development, or other unanticipated discoveries developed by the contractor without the use of proprietary materials will be covered by the standard Patent Rights Clause (FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997).  Furthermore, the Contractor will have the right to ask for greater rights, as defined in the clause, if the supplier of the proprietary compound is not interested in the subject invention.  

Potential offerors and other interested parties are invited to submit comments herein or provide “alternative plans” when responding to the solicitation for this contract, which would serve to meet the objectives/goals of this Program without the use of this deviation.  All plans and comments will be considered and discussed with interested parties. 

Any comments/plans regarding this clause should be submitted, in writing, by March 2, 2004, to Mr. Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Contract Management Branch, NIMH, NIH, 6001 Executive Blvd., Rm. 8154 (MSC 9661), Bethesda, MD 20892 (for Fed Ex, UPS etc. use Rockville, MD 20852);Voice: (301) 443-2234; Fax: (301) 443-0501; E-Mail: ba9i@nih.gov.  See solicitation for instructions on submission of “alternative plans” with a proposal.

The following Statement of Facts provides more detail into the potential use of a deviated patent rights clause:

Statement of Facts

The primary goal of the Molecular Libraries initiative is to improve public health by stimulating the discovery, development, and commercialization of new research tools and potential therapeutic compounds for the treatment of a variety of disorders and the validation of new targets for drug therapy.  We believe the synthesis and repository activities of this contract may constitute an exceptional circumstance where the imposition of a FAR deviation, through a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), would further the achievement of the programmatic goals and meet the objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200.  Historically, the NIMH has obtained the approval of DECs in similar contract programs where proprietary materials are involved. 
 
To meet the goals and objectives of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, this contract will need to acquire and maintain a library of hundreds of thousands of diverse small molecules, which will become a major resource to investigators for further evaluation in a wide variety of assays of biological activity.  The small molecules collected in this repository will be arrayed and sent to screening centers (i.e. grantees, which are not part of this contract) or investigators, to be evaluated and screened for a large number of possible new activities and applications.  Screening will enhance the identification of small molecules that are useful as research tools (e.g., probes to alter the function of novel proteins or molecular imaging probes) or as starting points for the development of novel compounds with therapeutic potential.  The contractor shall maintain an appropriate quantity of each compound by either repurchasing additional quantities, or through synthesis efforts. Under this contract, both proprietary and non-proprietary materials will be provided directly by the compound suppliers (or through NIH) to the contractor for inclusion in the compound collection/repository.   It is anticipated that some of the most unique and promising compounds with the most interesting biological activities will be proprietary.   Therefore, in order  for this program to succeed, it will be essential to obtain a sufficient flow of proprietary materials.

Our previous experience and discussions with compound suppliers (i.e., investigators at academic institutions, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies) have shown that they will not submit their proprietary materials without complete assurance that their intellectual property rights will be protected, such as that which could be provided through a DEC.  

Through discussions with these organizations it was determined that, except for the protection offered by this clause, the NIH would have no other method to gain access to some of these promising compounds; this would result in a less effective and less diverse and unique compound collection.  As many of the compounds with the most interesting activity will be proprietary, having an insufficient number of these compounds submitted for inclusion in the repository would inhibit the discovery of promising new leads for further development as potential research tools or therapeutics.  This would not appear to appropriately support the objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200, et. seq., or benefit the public health under this program. 

Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly unlikely to invest in areas such as the development of research compounds to be used as research tools, imaging probes, or as therapeutics for rare or ‘orphan’ diseases because of cost-restraints and low potential returns. Therefore, this program will fill a critical need by supporting and stimulating the development of much-needed research tools and potential therapeutics that might not otherwise be developed.  It is expected that many investigators who use the compound collection will go on to further develop these compounds into much-needed agents and therapeutics to further research and benefit the public health.   

We recognize the scientific expertise of the contractors and the importance of the Bayh-Dole Act in protecting the intellectual property rights of contractors.  While Bayh-Dole provides incentives for the commercialization of Government supported research and development by allowing contractors to retain rights to inventions, the Act also permits an exception to this provision under exceptional circumstances. In this instance, we believe that restriction or elimination of the contractor’s right to retain title to subject inventions, in a narrow field, may be needed to further the programmatic goals of research and development in order to benefit public health. 

If adopted, use of the proposed restricted Patent Rights clause has been narrowly tailored to apply only to subject inventions using proprietary materials obtained and evaluated under these contracts, and not to subject inventions outside the scope of the deviated patent rights clause.  The Contractor will have the right to ask for greater rights, as defined in the clause, if the supplier of the proprietary materials is not interested in licensing or pursuing the invention. Furthermore, even if a DEC were implemented, rights to subject inventions made without the use of proprietary materials would remain with the contractor, and will be subject to the standard clause at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997). 

Based on previous experience with similar programs, we have discussed and considered approaches other than the use of a DEC for acquiring and evaluating proprietary materials, but we are not currently aware of any viable alternatives that would adequately address the concerns noted above.

<SUBJECT>FLUSHING OF CHT ZONES ON USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73)
<DESC>The US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) announces a change in stablebase (mylar) format for Missile requirements.  With the emerging technology available today, AMCOM will no longer provide dimensionally-accurate Mylar plots of engineering d ata, but rather digital imagery.  Digital imagery has proven to be more accurate and  will be included in the technical data package bid set.  This imagery  can be reproduced to Mylar at your expense if you so desire.  Due to the high degree of metrology r equired to produce dimensionally-accurate stable-base products, AMCOM recommends that only a certified contractor produce stable-base plots from the digital imagery we distribute. If you require a dimensionally-accurate Mylar plot of a stable base digital image found in an AMCOM technical data package, Ezekiel IPM at 678-281-0139 has been certified as a producer and is provided as informational data only.  After the required synopsis period of time of 30 days, all AMCOM missile requirements with digital ima gery will have this data in the technical data package contained on the CDROM and no hardcopy of the stablebase will be provided.  Point of Contact is stan.crittenden@redstone.army.mil.  Please email any questions and/or concerns.
