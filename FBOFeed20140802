<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Epidemiology is the scientific study of the causes and distribution of disease in populations. NCI-funded epidemiology research is conducted through research at institutions in the United States and internationally with funding through the extramural Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP) and other Programs in the </span><a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences</span></a><a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/extlinks.html"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(DCCPS). Metabolomics is the assessment of small molecules, often defined to be only those molecules participating in cellular metabolism, within a given biological system. Metabolites include low-molecular weight compounds, such as lipids, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides. Modern methods, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Mass Spectroscopy (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), can identify and quantify a large&nbsp;number of metabolites simultaneously within a biospecimen, capturing its metabolomic profile.&nbsp; These profiles have been used to predict the risk of diabetes, diagnose prostate cancer, and identify biomarkers of Crohn's disease. There is a strong interest in applying metabolomic analysis to cancer epidemiologic studies. Since epidemiologic studies often involve field biospecimen collection, the conditions of sample processing, handling, and storage may vary, which may affect the reliability of the results and increase the risk of detecting false biomarker candidates. However, to obtain an accurate assessment of an individual's metabolomic profile, NCI need to understand and then eliminate or alter sample preparation steps that affect measured metabolite levels. It is important to realize the potential variability from the sample handling to properly control for the effect of pre-analytical parameters on metabolite measurements when performing metabolomics research. Understanding this variability is an essential prerequisite to broadening the use of metabolomics technologies to epidemiological studies and pooling measurements from different population-based studies. </span></p>

Most endometrial cancers develop slowly through progression of well characterized precursors, many of which regress with progesterone treatment or are curable with hysterectomy. Thus, early detection of endometrial cancer precursors should enable prevention of many endometrial cancers and reduce mortality. Therefore, researchers at the National Cancer Institute have developed risk prediction models to evaluate endometrial cancer risk based on risk factor data such as BMI and parity. The purpose of this acquisition is to enroll 300 women at increased risk of endometrial cancer. From all women, biological specimens shall be collected with a Tao brush and a tampon. In addition, frozen tissue specimens and blood samples, as well as covariate data for relevant endometrial cancer risk factors shall be collected.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Repairs to the Menemsha Creek Jetties in Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard, MA, to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  Work is expected to begin in October 2014 and all work, including site restoration, must be completed by May 31, 2015.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> Menemsha Creek Federal Navigation Project is located on the northwestern end of Martha's Vineyard, MA about 12 miles southwest of Falmouth, Massachusetts.  The proposed work involves repairing those sections of the east and west jetties that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 and will involve mobilizing heavy construction equipment, armor stone and other project materials to Menemsha by water. <br>   <br> The repair work will involve reconstructing both the east and west jetty to pre-storm conditions including side slopes and crest height.   The quantity of stone to be placed is currently estimated at approximately 1,000 tons, split between the two jetties.  A small amount of displaced stone is expected to be recovered from the site adjacent to the jetties, but the majority of stone needed for the repairs will need to be brought to the construction site from offsite (mainland) sources as there is no known quarry on island. New stone needed to repair the structures is expected to range in size from 2 - 4 tons.   Significant portions of both jetties will require  quote mark dismantling quote mark  prior to rebuilding with new stone so that pre-storm elevations and side slopes can be matched and the armor stone can be properly aligned and interlocked.  It is expected that some of the areas of repair will need to be worked on from marine plant as equipment located on land cannot safely reach portions of the structure. <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects in the last 5 years involving construction/repair of similar massive stone structures, such as seawalls, rubble mound breakwaters, and jetties, from marine plant.  Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on massive stone structures from marine plant.  Please indicate the team subcontractor(s), including their prior experience and qualifications, which will be used to support the offeror's effort.  Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages and proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are due no later than 4:00PM on June 9, 2014.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Raushanah Muhammad or by email to raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil.  Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.   <br>

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation. Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation. If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children. Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items. EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Responses for each evaluation factor will need to be submitted with your proposal. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>I. Description of Requirement
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), section has the requirement to procure two Brand Name, Irys<sup>TM</sup> Systems, manufactured by BioNano Genomics Irys<sup>TM</sup> Systems, 9640 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA. 92121, or Equal. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/ solicitation number is N02RC42547-83. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 20) 05-72, (January 2014) Simplified Procedures for a Commercial Item. The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 334515 and the Business Size Standard are 500. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.<br /><br />The Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute has multiple laboratories that provide genomics technologies to the CCR research community to advance cancer research, including the CCR Genomics Core and the CCR Genetics Branch. Investigating genomic alterations, including repeat regions and rearrangements are extremely difficult to interpret using current short-read sequencing technologies (e.g., Illumina platform) or array-based technologies. These methods at best provide indirect evidence of structural aberrations. New technologies are needed to supplement the sequencing approaches to permit proper scaffolding of contigs to increase the completion and accuracy of de novo assemblies. CCR investigators currently have access to multiple Cores that offer short-read sequencing and microarray technologies but has no access to platforms that permit the direct measurement of structural variations, including indels, copy number variations, rearrangements and accurate measurement of gaps. In order to meet this requirement, the CCR wishes to acquire two Irys<sup>TM</sup> Systems to be installed in the CCR Genomics Core and the CCR Genetics Branch. <br />The following salient characteristics apply:</p>
<p>The NCI requires a platform or device that enables mapping of extremely long strands of mammalian genomic DNA for comprehensive genome analysis. This system must include:<br />a. A bench top instrument that performs electrophoresis and imaging of labeled DNA in a flow cell, for genomics analysis. <br />b. Electronically operated instrument that contains an embedded computer to program each run, regulate all the functions, and monitor instrument performance. <br />c. Reagents and consumables for DNA extraction, labeling, and staining DNA from a variety of sample sources, and loading must be available commercially to support the mapping of mammalian genomes. <br />d. Nanofluidic environment to allows molecules to move swiftly through thousands of parallel channels simultaneously, enabling high-throughput processing to build a more accurate genome map.<br />e. Software and algorithms for quality control, de novo assembly, and sequence or reference alignment must be available for post-process analysis of DNA samples.<br />f. An integrated system with the ability to visualize unamplified, native-state DNA molecules at a minimum of hundreds of kilobases long, and up to and longer than a megabase.<br />g. Must include at least 3 laser lines for detection of multiple events.</p>
<p>II. Delivery</p>
<p>Contractor(s) shall deliver the item within 30 days after award to NIH/NCI Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The Contractor that receives the award will be provided with the complete mailing address and point of contact. Upon delivery, contractor must notify the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to schedule the installation date and time.</p>
<p>III. Installation</p>
<p>The contractor shall install the equipment and have ready to use within seven (7) days after<br />delivery.</p>
<p>IV. Payment</p>
<p>Payment shall be made after delivery, installation, and successful operation of the camera parts. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoice to the NCI COR and NIH Commercial Accounts.</p>
<p>QUOTATIONS ARE DUE: August 12, 2014 at 11:00 am, EST.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/ solicitation number is N02RC42561-83. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 20) 05-72, (January 2014) Simplified Procedures for a Commercial Item. The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 334516 and the Business Size Standard is 500. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The LCB studies the processing, transport, and metabolism of proteins and small molecules related to malignant transformation and multidrug resistance in cancer. NCI employ the techniques of cryo-electron tomograpy and cryo-electron microscopy for studying single particles as well as virus and bacteria. Samples that are plunge-frozen are transferred and imaged in the electron microscope while they are still frozen. <br /><br />Description of Requirement</p>
<p>Structural biologists and cell biologists at Center for Cancer Research are interested in understanding structural aspects of a variety of cell-cell and host-pathogen interactions. Understanding the nature of these interactions at the highest possible resolution helps define the molecular mechanisms underlying various cellular processes important in health and in diseased. Emerging methods in 3D light and electron microscopy are becoming increasingly important for such structural studies. The types of specimens that are studied include bacterial and mammalian cells, tissue specimens, as well as cellular conjugates that relevant to understanding viral entry and infection.</p>
<p>The proposed purchase of the Zeiss focused ion beam scanning electron microscope will provide a versatile tool that will enable these studies to be carried out using a single platform. Specimens for analysis will be either: fixed, stained and plastic-embedded or high-pressure frozen, and freeze-substituted and plastic-embedded to prepare them for imaging. The microscope will allow for automated data collection from these specimens using highly automated procedures, implemented using software that is embedded in the microscope and capable of 24/7 remote operation.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the ion beam scanning electron microscope are as follows:</p>
<p>a. High resolution configuration with optimal working distance ranging from 0.7 nm at 30 kV (STEM mode) to 3.0 nm at 0.2 kV, achieved with untilted and tilted specimens without stage biasing. <br />b. Acceleration Voltage for the SEM column must be adjustable from 0.02 to 30kV, continuously variable in 0.01 kV steps.<br />c. Probe current range must be continuously variable from 10pA to 40nA <br />d. Magnification must be continuously variable from12x through 1,000,000xe. Shottky field emitter electron source <br />f. Focus compensation must allow for minimizing extent of focus change over the entire acceleration voltage and probe current range.<br />g. Scanning electron beam shift desired range is 200 microns at 20kV at an 8.5mm working distance.<br />h. Focused Ion Beam must be with gallium liquid metal ion source, with resolution of 3nm at 30kV, magnification of 300x-500,000x, at acceleration voltage range of 0.5 - 30kV with built-in electrostatic FIB beam blanking.<br />i. FIB column with multiple mechanical aperture positions, motorized, and with ability to continuously vary probe current between aperture positions.<br />j. Specimen stage travel requirements are at least 100 mm in x and y directions and 50 mm in z direction with tilt range of 70 degrees.<br />k. In-lens high efficiency, column-mounted annular scintillator detector and in-lens EsB, column mounted high efficiency scintillator detector with optically coupled PMT for detection of energy and angle selective backscattered electrons. Filtering grid should be adjustable from 0V to -1.5V for contrast enhancement.<br />l. Configuration allows imaging under a variety of conditions which include FIB used for imaging with SEM OFF, FIB is used for milling with SEM OFF, simultaneous imaging with SEM and FIB together, and with control of FIB and SEM via an external scan generator<br />m. Images with 16 bit dynamic range ranging from 512 x 384 pixels to 50000 x 40000 pixels <br />n. Features for noise reduction must include ability to continuously average multiple pixels at all scan speeds, continuous averaging of 2 to 255 frames/lines (user selectable) with image freeze on demand.<br />o. Automatic vacuum system with automatically operated pneumatic column isolation valve with ultimate high vacuum of 10-6 mbar or better. <br />p. Large field automated imaging with milled slice thickness monitored by angled notches milled into the Pt layer on sample with use of stable milled pattern in the Pt layer is used for auto focus and stigmation during automated sample acquisition.</p>
