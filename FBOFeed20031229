DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.  

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term o f the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Fleet established a requirement for full configuration P-3C Aircraft Improvement Program (AIP) mission readiness trainers in FY 02.  The four existing 2F179 AIP Tactical Aircrew Coordination Trainers (TACT) lack acoustic sensor operator stations and require upgraded capability at other aircrew stations to achieve a full mission readiness level trainer.  Also, fatigue life expended (FLE) issues have dictated that AIP readiness training be shifted into trainers to conserve P-3 airframe life.  The AIP readiness trainer requirement is supported by N789 in the APN7 budget and FAST Plan for FY 04 - 06.  
The redesignated 2F179A Tactical Operational Readiness Trainer (TORT) will provide full aircrew coordination training and readiness certification training for P-3C AIP aircrews.  The 2F179A TORT will be an across-the-board upgrade of the current 2F179 TACT.  A stand-alone prototype 2F179A TORT will be delivered to NAS Jacksonville.  Subsequently, the four existing 2F179 TACT trainers will be upgraded to the new 2F179A TORT configuration.   The result will be five 2F179A TORT trainers. 
The trainers are located in NAS Jacksonville, NAS Brunswick, NAS Whidbey Island, and NAS Kaneohe Bay.
The 2F179A TORT prototype and four 2F179 TACT to 2F179A TORT upgrades will be acquired through open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract.  A delivery order will be awarded under the TSC II ID/IQC on a Best Value, trade-off analysis acquisition approach.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR SUBCONTRACTING INFORMATION ONLY.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training & Support, Orlando, FL for support services (including maintenance) for government owned Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Offload Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS).  These services will be awarded under a Basic Agreement, with Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training & Support (LM STS).  The Government intends to award numerous contracts via the Basic Agreement with LM STS throughout fiscal year 2004 for these services utilizing the prices, terms and conditions of the Basic Agreement that will be awarded to LM STS.  The requirements will be for support services for CASS testers/stations located throughout the world (both domestic and foreign).  The following CASS Offload OTPS shall included under the Basic Agreement: RADCOM EA-6B, CATIIID EA-6B, HTS EA-6B, DTB EA-6B, RADCOM H-60, TMV H-60, HTS H-60, NEWTS, RADCOM E-2C, CATIIID E-2C, and HTS F-18.  Services that will be provided for each OTPS shall include, but not be limited to all subcomponents, subassemblies and ancillary gear associated with each individual OTPS.    The period of performance for each contract will be approximately one year from the award date; some may be less than one year.  Also, some contracts may contain options for additional support services for an additional one-year of services.  The government intends to procure these services under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  Many of these OTPS are still in the development phase, therefore, the government does not own data, drawings, software code or other specifications to permit full and open competition.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may be used by the government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should reference N68335-04-R-0031.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  The Navy anticipates the awards to be firm fixed price contracts.  No solicitations will be available for this procurement.

FORM B
REQUEST FOR SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, FPS requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with FPS. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Richard Wheelwright, Contract Specialist, (973)724-7050
<DESC>The government proposes to award a contract to the Boeing Company, St. Louis, Missouri to conduct a pre-QFD meeting to study the two technical approaches  identified. One approach is to design a flat-bottomed platform that moves on  rollers on USAF aircraft and equipment.  The second approach is to design a  crawler (much like the crawler used by NASA to transport shuttles to the launch  pad), and to mount six to seven crawlers on a platform so that it moves on the  floor of a USAF aircraft and equipment. Boeing Decision Analysis is the only contractor who can meet the strict time  performance requirements for the Modular Intermodal Platform (MIP) QFD effort.   The Boeing Team has a great deal of experience in related QFD efforts as they  presided over both the FTTS and FTTS trainer QFD efforts.  Because both of  these efforts went over well and because our MIP effort will tie into the FTTS  efforts, we will be using the same contracted support for the MIP QFD effort.   This selection will provide some congruency between the efforts and lead to a  more streamlined process and product. a)After this effort, five contractors will submit proposals for a MIP platform  that will address each of the requirements identified by the QFD process.  In  addition, other requirements may be amended to this contract, prior to award,  as deemed necessary.  After proposals are received by the government from this  effort, follow-on contracts will be awarded to develop and build prototypes of  their perspective designs. b)The QFD will be held on February 17-20 with a pre-meeting on February 4, 5,  and 6.  These meeting will be held at Fort Lee, Virginia with a specific  location to be determined as the meetings approach.  At these meetings we will  have the voting members of the QFD team as well as an active audience  consisting of non-voting government employees, the perspective contractors, and  representatives from interfacing commercially made equipment.    c)These POs are restricted because of the short performance time and because of  funding constraints.  Each of these contractors is spooled up on the  operational requirements of the platform and they were awarded contracts for  development of EDS-A (Enhanced Delivery System – Air) proposals.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Request for Proposals RFPs to award one firm-fixed price contract for the design and construction (design-build) of the new 1st Brigade Barracks at Ft. Drum, New York. This project consists of constructing three (3) barracks buildings (2-story) with 92 rooms each for unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing (UEPH) facilities with integrated soldier community facilities in the 10200 area on Fort Drum. Construction is to m atch the architectural theme of adjacent buildings which are of masonry construction.Design and construction shall comply with the specifications and requirements contained in the RFP. This is a one-step solicitation with price evaluation preference for HU BZone small business concerns in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4. The Government will use a lowest price technically accepted selection approach for this selection. This solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public b id opening. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimum standards for design and construction quality. The solicitation criteria rely predominately upon military design standards for barracks to meet program specific requ irements for the Army's Barracks Program. The successful Offeror must design and construct a complete and useable facility, as described in the RFP documents. The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that gives the Government the greatest confidence in the Offerors ability to meet the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s requirements in an affordable manner. Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the  RFP in all aspects of project execution. A site visit will also be scheduled, for the Offerors, prior to submittal of proposals, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site. The proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the technical qual ifications and price. The evaluation process essentially consists of five parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, price evaluation, final proposal revision (if discussions are required) and final determination by the SSA. To be con sidered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated on RFP compliance and technical merits. Price proposals will be evaluated on price only. Price will not be sco red, but will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness through the use of price analysis. Technical factors are listed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3. Within ea ch factor, sub-factors are of equal importance. To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors. Technical evaluation includes evaluation of the both the technical proposal and the subcontracting plan. The cr iteria for technical evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1 - Past Relevant Experience of Offeror's Team: The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate relevant experience by the physical completion and acceptance of similar and relevant projects within the last seven (7) years. Factor 2 - Past Performance of Offeror's Team: The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate at a minimum satisfactory performance, including timely completion of punch list and warranty work, for t he projects submitted. Factor 3 - Qualifications of the Offeror's Team: The Offeror will provide an organization chart and the key personnel resumes for the Offeror's Design-Build Team. Factor 4 Ã¢Â€Â“ Subcontracting Plan: (a) The subcontracting plan shall  be submitted in a separate binder labeled Volume III - Subcontracting Plan. Large business concerns must submit as part of their proposal their subcontracting projecti ons for this project in accordance with FAR Contract Clauses 52.219-8 and 52.219-9. All large businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan with their technical and price/cost proposals. The plan should be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the Offeror ineligible for award of the contract. The submission of the subcontracting plan is in no way advantageous to large businesses over any small business in the evaluation process. (b) Small Disa dvantaged Business (SDB) Utilization Plan. (Applies to all Offerors.) Offerors shall submit a SDB Utilization Plan, to include the following information: (1) Identification of each SDB concern proposed and the work each is to perform. (2) Targets expressed  in dollars and percentages representing each SDB concernÃ¢Â€Â™s participation of the total contract value. (3) Total target value of all SDB participation, expressed in dollars and percentages, of the total contract value. Factor 5 Ã¢Â€Â“ Variant Changes to Technical Requirements. Offerors who intend to submit changes (betterments) to Section 01010 and/or drawings shall define these changes in Factor 5. A Ã¢Â€ÂœbettermentÃ¢Â€Â is defined as any component of system which exceeds the minimum requirements st ated in the Request For Proposal. If the offeror does not intend to make changes (betterments) to the 01010 Section and/or drawings, the offeror must provide a statement as such in Factor 5. The price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder labele d Volume II - Price Proposal. The sections shall parallel the submission requirements identified in the bid schedule. Provide six copies of bound written material (folded and bound in Volume II).

5. MARKET VALUE: $ 85,140.00 - $ 110,682.00 per annum  (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: March  2004 –  March 2006
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Basic Function of the position: 

The 1980s marked a watershed in recent Kosovo history.  During the 80s and early 90s, Serbia, the dominating “partner” in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, systematically began to exclude ethnic Albanians from positions of employment in the public and private sectors in the province of Kosovo as well as from access to services once available to them.  This systematic exclusionary policy, in Kosovo often referred to as apartheid, led to conflict between the Albanian population in Kosovo and the Serbian administrators and police.  The heavy-handed and eventually bloody attempts of the Serbs to put down the Albanian Kosovar rebellion ultimately led to the bombing campaign of NATO in 1999 that caused the withdrawal of Serbian authority and the establishment of UN administration (through UNMIK) over the province.

Support for the development of democracy and governance (DG) is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo.  USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo includes two DG strategic objectives (SOs): SO 2.1, Civil Society and Government are more Effective Partners in Achieving Good Governance, and  SO 2.2, More Open and Responsive Government Acting According to the Rule of Law.  
USAID assistance in support of these SOs has taken a number of forms.  USAID has granted funds to the National Democratic Institute with the aim of developing Kosovar political parties and strengthening the newly elected Assembly of Kosovo.  The International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) implements the Kosovo Independent Media Program (KIMP) with the aim of increasing the quality of journalism, strengthening supporting institutions (journalists and broadcasters associations), improving the legal and regulatory framework, and running media outlets as effective businesses.  IREX played a key role in starting Kosovo’s two private television stations, creating the terrestrial broadcast network, and advising OSCE and UNMIK on media law and regulations.  Through a grant to East West Management Institute (EWMI), USAID is focusing its civil society efforts on strengthening the ability of the NGO community to play a more active and effective role in advocating on a wide range of issues.  Other aspects of USAID’s civil society program in Kosovo include women’s leadership development through STAR/World Learning, a women’s internship program implemented by the National Albanian American Committee.  USAID has awarded a contract to the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to implement a justice system reform strategy program to support court administration reform, increased professionalism of the judiciary, public awareness of legal rights, and the transition of the justice system from UNMIK to Kosovar competencies.  A grant to ABA/CEELI focuses on increasing the professionalism of legal advocates through support to the Chamber of Advocates, promoting adoption of continuing legal education, publishing of a legal index, and other activities.  In the area of local governance USAID plans to fund a new initiative to strengthen local governance, improve municipal leadership, increase transparency and accountability at the local level, and assist municipal governments to promote local economic development.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers Day Announcement - Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN)
<DESC>PROPOSERS? DAY ANNOUNCEMENT:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency?s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) announces a Proposers? Day Workshop for the Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) new start.  The goal of this Proposers? Day Workshop is to discuss the goals of DTN, answer questions, and foster teaming among organizations to the extent practicable.  DARPA/ATO anticipates publishing a BAA shortly after the Proposers? Day.

The Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) Program will develop and field technology that will provide network services when no end-to-end path exists through the network.  The primary goal is to provide disruption tolerance by organizing information flow into bundles.  These bundles will be routed through an ?intelligent? DTN network that can manage the delivery of the bundles.  This method will allow messages to pass through the network with successive responsibilities, rather than the traditional end-to-end acknowledgement scheme.  DTN will result in the opportunistically leveraged connectivity and the use of multiple routes while relieving the delivery node of final acknowledgement. 

The second goal of DTN is to provide dynamic network naming and routing.  This method uses a late-binding of bundles (or packets) technique to specific nodes or delivery path.  This avoids forcing all parts of the network to be aware of all other parts of the network.  The result will be a network that matches the tactical unit deployment needs for mobility and stealth.  

The Proposers? Day Workshop will be held on 21 January 2004 at the George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, Ste 329, 3401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA beginning at 8:30am, and anticipated to last until 4:00pm.  Workshop check-in will begin at 8:00am.  The workshop fee is $55.  Presentations will include an overview of the DTN program, specifics for first phase BAA participation, and the evolution of Delay Tolerant  and Interplanetary Networking concepts by Vinton G. Cerf.

Please contact Marisa Riehn (Marisa_Riehn@sra.com) not later than 16 January 2004 if you plan to attend.  Please include your name, company name, mailing and e-mail addresses, phone, and citizenship in the e-mail.  Foreign nationals should complete and return a DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) not later than 16 January 2004 if they wish to attend the workshop.  The DARPA Form 60 will be sent to you based on declaration of citizenship.  The Proposers Day Workshop is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to a BAA.  This information will also be available through the DTN website: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/DTN/index.htm.  

Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the workshop may request authorization to do so.  Presentations may contain 2-4 slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues).  It is the presenter?s responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the DTN Proposers? Day Workshop is approved for presentation by the organization that originally funded the research.  Additionally, all material to be displayed at the workshop must be screened in advance by the DARPA Program Manager for sensitive, but unclassified material.  The DTN Proposers? Day Workshop will be open to the public.  Attendees who wish to make a presentation at the workshop should contact Marisa Riehn (Marisa_Riehn@sra.com) as soon as possible, but no later than 14 January 2004.  An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the DARPA Program Manager for review by 14 January 2004.

The work will be located at the Naval Air Engineering Station (NAES), Lakehurst, NJ. An A-E firm with multi-discipline capabilities is required to provide technical studies and/or designs (including all associated architectural or engineering services coincident with the production of construction contract plans, specifications and cost estimates) for an assortment of projects. In addition to the preparation of 100% complete construction contract documents utilized with the traditional Design-Bid-Build method of acquiring capital improvements, the firm selected for this contract may be required to prepare the abbreviated documents used in the request-for-proposal packages of Design-Build solicitations. The work primarily involves mechanical, electrical and/or fire protection engineering but may also include incidental architectural, civil engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, etc. aspects.
