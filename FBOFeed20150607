In addition, this acquisition provides for scientific and engineering support for the development, upgrades, and life cycle support for the Tape Processing System (TPS), which is used by the ONI as a primary shore-based acoustic data playback and analysis system under the ACINT Modernization program.  Contractor analytical and technical efforts will be required over all stages of system application, from concept formulation of engineering changes to operational fleet technical and logistic support.
