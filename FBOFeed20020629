<SUBJECT>--Amendment to Broad Agency Announcement entitled  New and Innovative Ideas in Advanced Technology
<DESC>NA Amendment 0004 to BAA DASG60-00-0005 This amendment incorporates the following one-time submission opportunity as specified below.   NEW AND INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY Mobile Extended Range Telemetry and Safety System Technology Demonstration Amendment BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT BAA DASG60-00-0005 Topics: C.14  Sensor Technology  8. Sensor/Data Fusion and Target Discrimination - 9.  Sensor and Other Flight Test Experiments   14. Test and Evaluation Infrastructure Concepts and Technology Demonstration This one-time acquisition is not open to allied participation. The purpose of this amendment to BAA DASG60-00-0005 is to solicit innovative ideas and concepts for a Mobile Extended Range Telemetry and Safety System (MERTSS) technology demonstration and the critical technologies required to implement this demonstration . A state-of-the-art MERTSS is needed to meet a critical requirement for MDA system testing.  Current MDA test plans call for integrated extended range missile tests over large portions of the Pacific Ocean.  Currently there is no system or set of systems that will collect telemetry and provide flight termination safety over the complete trajectories envisioned.  The MERTSS must advance the state of the art.   General System Concept:  The MERTSS should be capable of receiving, recording, and displaying in real-time multiple streams of high-rate telemetry data from units under test.  The system capabilities should meet the technical and mission data collection a s well as range safety requirements at various ranges or test locations in the Pacific, including Kodiak Alaska and Wake Island.  To provide maximum flexibility the system should be configured to permit both ship-based and land-based remote deployment and include Over-The-Horizon (OTH) satellite communications capability.  The system should be highly mobile and easily transportable. .    The technology demonstration should cover the entire Pacific range, which may necessitate using more than one system.  If multiple systems are used, each should be capable of standalone and integrated operation with other range control and range safety a ssets, including other MERTSS type systems.  Summary concept papers must be received Not Later Than 26 July 2002.  Formal BAA proposals will be requested based on the evaluation of the concept papers.  Except as otherwise noted in this amendment 004, the proposal preparation instructions in the basic BAA DASG60-00-0005 as amended through amendment 0003 shall apply. A single award under this BAA is anticipated for this special MERTSS initiative. The evaluation criteria set forth in basic BAA DASG60-00-0005 as amended through amendment 0003 shall be utilized to evaluate proposals and select an awardee.  Information Applicable to Proposals for the MERTSS Contract:  A. Nominal System Requirements: For additional Nominal System Requirements see  http://www.smdc.army.mil/contracts/contracts.html   1. MERTSS System Design.  The contractor shall propose a detailed set of system requirements and develop an overall MERTSS system design based on the nominal requirements provided in the attached file.  The system design approach should be modular with th e capability to deploy and operate the telemetry system either with or without the range safety system installed.  The design should be fully redundant to preclude a single point failure from preventing data collection and transmission or prevent proper fu nction, or cause an undesired output of the range safety system.  Also, the design should be expandable to meet future needs such as Multiple Simultaneous Engagements (MSE), higher bandwidth data, more efficient modulation schemes, and digital telemetry. The system design should make maximum use of Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software to achieve requirements.  The system should also be designed to accommodate future upgrades and state of the art technology advan ces.  The technology used for this demonstration should advance the state of the art in both hardware and software, wherever possible.   2.  MERTSS Simulations.   For the MERTSS concept defined in the above paragraph and attached nominal requirements, the contractor should perform trade studies and simulations in sufficient detail to quantify and balance critical subsystem performance requ irements, identify critical issues, and optimize system performance.   3. MERTSS Prototype Fabrication: The contractor shall fabricate prototype MERTSS systems. Emphasis shall be placed on system performance, schedule and cost management during fabrication.  The completed prototype systems will be subject to testing, performa nce evaluation and certification by the various National Ranges.   All hardware and software developed/fabricated for the MERTSS prototype systems will become government property.  4. Prototype Testing and Certification: Prototype testing and certification will be carried out after the completion of the prototype systems.  The contractor will be required to operate/maintain the prototype systems as required during this period.  The p rototype systems will be subjected to certification testing at the National Ranges specified.   B. Other Contract Information: The value for the MERTSS technology demonstration contract is not expected to exceed $22M for a total period of performance of approximately 36 months.  A Cost Plus Award Fee type contract is contemplated for this effort.   Q uestions relating to contractual/cost issues shall be directed to Ms. Paula Parker, e-mail address: paula.parker@smdc.army.mil or phone 256-955-2688.  Technical point of contact for the special MERTSS initiative under this BAA amendment is Ms. Judy Kenname r, e-mail address: Judy.Kennamer@smdc.army.mil (preferred method) or phone:  256-955-3674.
