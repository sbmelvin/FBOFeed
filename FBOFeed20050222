Tests shall be performed to indicate the suitability of the insulation for continued operation.  Inspection and insulation resistance tests shall be performed with acceptable results before the high potential tests.  All test results shall be retained. b.	Inspection.  Insulation shall be examined for evidence of degradation or damage, such as: ·	Puffiness, cracking, separation or discoloration    as indication of thermal aging. ·	Contamination of coil and connection surfaces. ·	Abrasion or other mechanical stresses ·	Evidence of partial discharge (corona). ·	Loose wedges, fillers, tiles, banding, or surge rings. ·	Fretting at supports bracing or crossing (an indication of looseness or movement). c.	Insulation Resistance Test.  Test voltage shall be applied for one minute, reference IEEE standard 43, section 5.4 and 12.2. d.	Polarization Index (P-1) Test.  The polarization index test shall be performed at the same voltage as the test in Paragraph 4.2.2 for ten minutes.  The recommended minimum value of polarization index for windings rated Class B and higher is 2.0 (References: IEEE Stds. 43, Sec. 9.2; and IEEE Stds. 432, App. A2).      If the one-minute insulation resistance is above 5000 megohms, the calculated polarization index may not meaningful.  In such cases, the polarization index may be disregarded as a measure of winding condition (Reference: IEEE 43, Sec. 5.4 and 12.2). e.	Step Voltage Test.  A step voltage test shall be performed with the results forwarded to the government. f.   High Potential Test.  High-potential tests shall be        performed on windings and some accessories of    electrical machines at a specified voltage.

Inspection and insulation resistance tests with the acceptable results shall be performed before the high-potential tests.  Insulation resistance tests shall be repeated at the completion of the high potential tests. High-potential tests shall be successively applied between each winding or electric circuit under test and the frame (or core) of the machine.  All other windings or electric circuits not under test shall be connected to the frame (or core).      Electrical machines may be tested using AC or DC high-potential test equipment.  A DC instead of an AC voltage may be used for high-potential tests.  In such cases, the DC test voltage shall be 1.7 times the specified AC voltage.  A failure under test can be less damaging to the winding if a DC voltage is used.  Multiply the AC test voltage by 1.7 to obtain the equivalent DC test.  Perform AC high-potential testing by applying the specified voltage at 60 Hz, for one minute.  Perform DC high potential testing by applying specified voltage for duration of one minute after test voltage is reached.  The DC potential shall be increased gradually to the desired test voltage in order to limit the charging current.  Reconditioned windings should be tested at 65% of the new winding test value. h.	Load Test.  A full load test shall be arranged with NRTF or as necessary to check the operating characteristics of the machine (Reference IEEE 112 and 115 and NEMA MG-1). 10.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contract with firm-fixed-prices, using commercial methods as described in FAR Part 12, on a sole source basis to Andrew Corporation of Orland Park, IL.  The contract will have a one-year base period and four one-year options, for a total of five years.  The contract will be for Fiber Optic Micro Cable (FOMC) manufactured to NOSC Specification 946-0004-91, Product Fabrication Specification for Fiber Optic Microcable, dated 3 February 1992.  Pricing will be required for continuous lengths of less than 10 kilometers, continuous lengths equal to or greater than 10 kilometers but less than 20 kilometers, continuous lengths equal to or greater than 20 kilometers but less than 23 kilometers, and continuous lengths equal to or greater than 23 kilometers but less than 28 kilometers.  The estimated maximum quantity for the base and all option periods is 7,275,000 meters of FOMC.  This is a follow-on effort to contract N66001-99-D-5032.  Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs and delays to the Government based on the specialized knowledge and experience developed by Andrew Corporation under the prior contract.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>Yosemite National Park is requesting bids for a telecommunications study of the Park's environs.  The goal is to develop a single backbone hybrid system throughout YNP to maximize equipment use and fulfill the park's needs.  The network would be used to pipeline the transfer of computer LAN data, radio communications, security and safety video systems, telephony, burglar/intrusion and fire alarm systems, traffic collection data, and telemetry throughout YNP on one system instead of separate costly systems.  This hybrid system would utilize industry standard technology maximizing bandwidth.  An additional goal is improving radio coverage due to the narrowband and digital P25 compliant radio requirements. Contracting Limitations:  FAR 9.5 restricts design contractors involvement in the resultant system purchases.  The design contractor, parent firm or subsidiary shall not be eligible of award of the system, major subsystem, or the first year of maintenance.  These limitations are formalized in the statement of work.  Please contact Lloyd Sheetz at lloyd_sheetz@nps.gov for further details on N8826-05-0017

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one each 4-axis aerospace grade rear beam filament winding machine, Entec #5K30-120-4-1, complete with all needed features required to filament wind pressure vessels up to 30" X 120" and handle a part that weighs up to 5,000 pounds.  This includes Wimax-II Control System, Pattern Generation Software, Pre-preg Delivery System, and Installation and Training. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Engineering Technology (ENTEC) Corporation, 2975 South 300 West, Salt Lake City, UT  84115-3436.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The ENTEC winding machine being acquired is a more modern reliable version of an older ENTEC winding machine currently being used at MSFC that is obsolete and difficult to use.  In addition, MSFC has a separate ENTEC machine, which is currently being utilized.  The machine being acquired has a similar operating system as both currently owned MSFC machines, and will provide necessary compatibility.	The machine acquired from ENTEC would provide an exact back-up system for producing necessary hardware such as pressure vessels and aerospace components with the required level of accuracy should the other utilized machine malfunction or be down for repairs.  This equipment can be utilized simulatenously with the other machinery to provide faster production.	 2. A machine acquired from a different vendor could not provide this compatibility because another vendor’s machine could not simulate and reproduce current winding patterns because this software is proprietary to ENTEC and cannot be obtained from any other vendor.  Considerable engineering design and software development would be required and another company would be unable to reproduce current hardware such as aerospace components with the needed level of accuracy since the slightest changes to processing parameters would create questions on validity of data and require that a large program, such as Shuttle, manufacture and test numerous pieces of the hardware being manufactured (possibly up to 20) to ensure performance was not compromised, requiring additional time, personnel and funds.   This could also result in a delay to NASA’s critical return to flight schedule and NASA’s mission and cause irreparable harm.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 28, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This solicitation is being offered to encourage interested parties to develop a dispersal system mounted on a fixed wing aircraft to apply Disrupt II (pheromone flakes) using Gelva 2333 as a sticker.  Current technology for applying the pheromone flakes and sticker is the Hercon pod mounted on fixed-wing aircraft (Air Tractor).  Due to availability of the components and the complexity of the pods, there is a need to develop flake dispersal systems using technology that is more readily available.  The dispersal system must be designed, built and mounted on a fixed wing aircraft and meet the criteria i.e. calibration and characterization, before it will be considered for use under this solicitation.  This solicitation is to test the operational readiness of new flake/sticker dispersal system technology.    Potential test blocks may be located in the following states: North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  The treatment acreage will be confined to one state for each prospective bidder.  Areas selected for treatment under this proposal will be identified in the RFP.  Application is expected to occur sometime between mid June to early July 2005. One application of Disrupt II at two rates will be applied to approximately 10,000 acres in treatment blocks located in the Slow the Spread (STS) action area in 2005.  All technical questions should be addressed to Donna Leonard at (828) 257-4329 or Dee Dee Sellers at (540) 432-8245.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) intends to award follow-on work using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Ray Turner of River Metal Recycling, Inc.of Newport, KY. Under  Purchase Order 3W-2356-NTLX, Mr. Turner provided technical support for  EPA's Scrap Metal Projects at the ports of Darrow, LA and Charleston, SC.  The purpose of this additional work is to incorporate a best practice/ISO-9000 standard at all U.S. ports involved  in the importing and  exporting of scrap metal. The contractor will assess all technical and economic implications of implementing an ISO/9000 best practice standard for monitoring imported scrap shipments for radioactive contamination, as well as industry capabilities and requirements to assess the implementation of a  ISO/9000 best practice type of standard. In addition,  the contractor will provide support in developing an international monitoring protocol for imported scrap metal.  The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe will base this protocol in part on the information gathered from the ports of  Darrow and Charleston. It has been determined that because of the ability of Mr. Turner to use the current project's background and scrap metal data, and his expertise internationally with radioactive sources found in scrap metal trade, he is the only vendor uniquely qualified to meet this  requirement. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the response date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting  must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Electricity Company of Ghana, Stephen Akuoko, Managing Director, Electro Volta House, P.O. Box 521, Accra, Ghana, Phone: 233-21-676-762, Fax: 233-21-666-262, Email: sakuaoko@ecggh.com. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for a rural electrification certification program.  The objective of the proposed United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) supported activity is to assist ECG develop a strategy to optimize the use of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to connect and maintain rural and peri-urban customers.  The selected U.S. contractor will develop and implement a certification program that defines operational guidelines and management procedures to SMEs in order for these entities to act as service providers under concession agreements with ECG.

ECG is a wholly owned government entity that is mandated to connect rural and peri-urban Ghanaians to the national electricity grid.  ECG, however, has been unable to keep up with demand for electricity connections.  Because of this lack of capacity, ECG has agreed to work with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to take on this role.  The proposed technical assistance will develop a certification program that will give SMEs credentials necessary to act as service providers to ECG.  The result will be the creation of mini-distribution companies throughout rural and peri-urban communities in the country.  

The certification program will establish policy, procedures, and initial training to SMEs.  The program will ensure that SME managers operate by recognized rural utility management practices.  The SMEs will work on behalf of ECG and have annual reporting requirements, including self-audits, and random on-site audits of overall performance will be orchestrated by ECG.  The SMEs will manage a central switch from ECG’s distribution network, which will then be connected to individual customer meters.  SMEs will be responsible for monthly pre-payment of individual meter-use, and each SME will be held accountable for each central switching station’s off-take from the ECG grid network.  ECG currently has identified 60 possible SMEs throughout the country that would be possible candidates for the certification program. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $246,875 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 PM, March 31, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with FLIR Systems, Inc.,  (FSI), Boston, 25 Esquire Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, for Repair Services to four Maritime Forward Looking Infrared (MARFLIR) units at an estimated cost or $50,000.00.  The basis for the sole source is that obtaining other than FSI's services for repair of the MARFLIR is not possible due to a lack of rights in technical data.  As background information, in 2000, the Government competitively awarded contract N00164-00-D-0026 to FSI for MARFLIR.  With this competitive selection, MARFLIRs were fielded and installed on NSW MKV craft.  As it was a commercial contract, technical data rights (other than Government Purpose Rights) were not obtained.  The Government does not have any mechanical and electrical drawings, information on internal software and interface control documents to provide to another company.  Based on this the repair services for the  four MARFLIR units must be obtained from FSI.  Responses to this synopsis must be submitted by 28 Feb 2005.  Any questions  regarding the above requirement should be submitted via email to Val Romanchek at romancv@socom.mil, (813) 828-7335.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Requirement:  A solid state laser system including an injection seeded pulsed Nd:YAG Laser, integrated harmonic conversion and wavelength separation hardware, and a motorized controlled tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator for broadband frequency co nversion.  The Nd:YAG specification includes a variable pulse repetition frequency up to 30 Hz.  Injection seeding is required for efficient and quality conversion of the OPO.   Output Energy of the Nd:YAG laser must be 1500 mJ/pulse @ 30Hz @ 1064 nm funda mental with injection seeding, 700 mJ/pulse @ 30 Hz 532 nm second harmonic with injection seeding, 400 mJ/pulse @ 30Hz 355 nm third harmonic with injection seeding.  The Q-switched temporal pulse width must be 10 ns nominal at 1064 nm.  The laser must have  mounted dichroic optics to separate 355 nm and 532 nm from 1064 nm for external, non-OPO usage.  Input Power must be 220 VAC single phase.  The motorized OPO must be continuously tunable from 440-705 and 715-2000 nm without changing any optical components , including dichroic separation optics.  At 30Hz, the OPO must provide greater than 50 mJ per pulse between 440 nm and 650 nm and greater than 15mj between 1000nm and 1300nm.  The OPO linewidth must be less than 80 cm-1 across the entire tuning range (barr ing the degeneracy gap).  The OPO output beam must be nominally round in shape with less than 1mrad divergence, less than 200urad pointing stability, +10% pulse-to-pulse energy stability and less than 10ns timing jitter.  The flash lamp lifetime shall be r ated at less than 20 million pulses.  Two (2) copies of the user manuals and schematics for the pump laser and OPO system (and any additional equipment provided by the vendor) are to be provided.  The warranty on electrical and mechanical components shall be a minimum of one year and the warranty on optical components shall be a minimum of 90 days.  The system shall be delivered within 120 days after receipt of order by the vendor, and the vendor shall bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.  A n option shall be included for on site set-up and one day of training support.  *Evaluation of quotations will be based on overall lowest cost and the ability to meet the performance measures stated herein. **Acceptance testing by the receiving office shal l be performed with 21 days of receipt.  -Please contact Mari B. Beckler via e-mail at mari.beckler@wsmr.army.mil with a copy of the proposal NLT 8:00am MST 01 MAR 2005. (Or fax to (505) 678-5107).

<CONTACT>Katie R. Brasfield, 0015405421423
<DESC>USACE has a requirement to secure the services of a Design/Build Construction firm for the Al Mamoon Exchange and Telecommunications Center in Baghdad, Iraq.  Baghdad Telecommunications plans to build what will become the new heart of its operations- Al Mamoon Exchange and Telecommunications Center; a central office building, a post office, a parking structure, and a plaza.  The office building will cater to the needs of the Exchange and Telecommunication Authority combined departments and associated a ctivities; Administration and Accounting Departments, Planning & Operation Department, Engineering Department, Switching and Maintenance Department, Wireless and Mobile Department, and a Traffic Control Department. The post office will serve as one of Baghdads downtown central offices, and the parking structure will be designed to accommodate 250 regular parking spaces, 10 spaces for postal vans, and 2 spaces for delivery trucks with loading facilities, and the plaz a will connect the structures with each other and with the district. The Telecommunication Authority desires its new building to utilize the maximum height allowed at the site by the Civil Aviation and Baghdad Municipality.  Thus, the height of the building is expected to be higher than the existing buildings in the vicinit y of Baghdad Central.  The building will be topped by steel mast to mount telecom antennae encased in I.M.D.S.F. Radome. The desired office building should include a type of service core that allows a combination of large office spaces, also affords the opportunity for developing small secluded spaces for private offices.  The circulation plan should conform and complement t he predominant work flow requirements.  The final office building space program and the exact area requirements for the different offices shall be finalized with SPCO in coordination with the Exchange and Telecommunication Authority departments heads and e mployees at the preliminary design stage. The Al Mamoon Telecommunication Center is envisioned as Iraqs new communication hub that will represent the new Iraq, where a government agency is demonstrating its ability to serve the citizen with dignity and transparency.  The post office will bring ne eded services to the city center, and the parking garage will add convenience in accessibility.  The new office building will be the place where one comes, alone or as a group to conduct communication business, learn about future exchange ideas and opportu nities.  Thus, the design of the building should generate a place for agency employees and staff to conduct an efficient operation with large open work spaces, private offices, conference rooms, exhibit hall, cafeteria, and a large hall for lectures and pu blic seminars.  The building should be environmentally responsive and demonstrably comfortable in both summer and winter. The building will act as a symbolic place which shall reflect the communication center identity, dynamism and developments, the progressive role it plays within Iraq, as well as its connection with the global community.  The building should definitely stan d out as one of Baghdads new urban landmarks reflecting state of the art in both architecture and engineering. The existing project site is located on 14 Ramadan Street, at Baghdads city center.  Existing on the site are two (2) partially destroyed buildings that will be demolished to make room for the new construction.  All infrastructure services exist on the si te such as telephone service, ducts/lines/manholes/etc., drainage lines/manholes/traps/etc., water lines/meters/valves/etc.  Power cables/ducts/panels/etc. are to be shifted beyond the new building area and are to be maintained uninterrupted by the constru ction activities during the execution of the project.  Power supply, drainage, water supply and irrigation facilities/networks/systems shall be upgraded/modified/redesigned to allow provision of such services to the whole install ation within the plot area, inclusive of the new building as well as all other remaining buildings. The new construction will consist of a telecommunication office building, a post office, a parking structure, and a plaza that connect the three new structures with each other and with the existing district.   It is the intent of the Contracting Officer to post the Request for Proposal on or about 05 March 2005. A pre-bid conference will be held on 05 March 2005.  Point of Contact for this conference is James Volz at (540)542-1432 or via email James.VolzGRC-3CBT@tac01.usace.army.mil.   Point of Contact for contract actions:  Katie R.

<DESC>The attached are responses to questions received for this RFI.

RESPONSES TO DCS RFI
NESDIS-DCS-2005-HLK

1. Q - Questions about the solicitation.
    A – This is a “Request for Information (RFI)” only from NOAA at this time.  There is no RFP planned at this time.  Any information about the current systems and mission can be found on the web site cited in the RFI.

2. Q – Is there a time-frame for the release of the RFQ for this proposal?
    A – No.  There is no RFP planned at this time.

3. Q – If we do not respond to this RFI, will this prevent a bid submittal when the RFQ is released?
    A – No, you may still respond to the RFP when one is released.

4. Q – Is NOAA seeking alternatives to the specifications listed?
    A – See response to #5, below.

5. Q – The RFI indicates that you are willing to consider alternate means of relaying data from the collection platforms to NOAA.  Does this mean that the GOES/POES/NPOESS satellites would not perform this task?
    A – Yes.  NOAA is interested in learning about and considering all options/capabilities for relaying and distributing the DCP data via commercial services.  Responders to the RFI will provide a technical approach for providing DCS services that may replace any or all of the existing system segments.  It may provide a better, more capable, flexible and cost-effective solution to a segment or an entire system.

6. Q – How is the data currently distributed from NOAA to the users?  Where are the users?  How many users are there?

POES
Raw data is preprocessed at NOAA into a common format and delivered to two global processing centers owned and operated by a quasi-commercial subsidiary of the French space agency CNES.  Collection Location Satellites (CLS) Toulouse France and Service Argos Inc.  Lanham MD converts the preprocessed data into scientific parameters and delivers data to the users.  The means of data delivery vary from telnet, e-mail, internet, and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Telecommunication System (GTS). GTS is an independent circuit with various gateways around the world where environmental data is shared for the modeling and operational forecast communities.  For more on the GTS visit http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TEM/gts.html.

Users of the POES Argos Data Collection System are located across the globe.  The system is used by researchers and Governments of approximately 39 different countries. 

(Statistics reported in June 2004)  There are 1,106 System Use Agreements in place covering 3,734 programs.  Argos DCS has issued 41,315 IDs for platforms and averages ~12,000 active platforms in a given month.

GOES
The users (mainly U.S. government agencies and international hydro-meteorological offices) are located throughout the GOES coverage area, including the US, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America.  For GOES, DCS data are distributed via several methods: directly from the GOES satellite for reception by a Direct Readout Ground System (DRGS); rebroadcast to a commercial DOMSAT system which retransmits a single data stream in Ku band for reception by a small antennae-based system; Internet distribution from our ground system, and some user Internet-based redistribution systems.  There are approximately 25,000 transmitters (DCPs), belonging to about 400 user agencies.

7. Q – Are you able to consider an alternate frequency (i.e., not the UHF band) for any part of the link - e.g., from the data collection platforms to NOAA, or from NOAA to the users?
Yes, if the frequency change can be coordinated and approved by the users, government agencies and found to be cost effective.
Currently, the frequencies used for the DCS link are set at the user’s platform transmitters and the spacecraft transponder. While there are other uplinks available for metsat use, there are many thousands of DCPs in use around the world using the 401-403 MHz band for this purpose.  The Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) has endorsed use of this band for DCP transmissions.  So it would pose quite a hardship to change all of the existing DCPs to a new frequency.  Of course this could not be accomplished for many years because existing metsats in orbit cannot change frequencies and for those in planning, changes would necessitate substantial delays and additional costs.  The other uplink frequencies available are 2025-2110 MHz, 8175-8215 MHz, 28.5-29 GHz, 40-40.5 GHz.  These higher frequencies would require a much different design.  Adding to the complexity of using these frequencies is the need to coordinate with existing users of these bands, in particular 2025-2110 MHz and 8175-8215 MHz. However, with lead time and advance coordinated planning, it may be possible. Responses to the RFI may describe alternate mechanisms for all links.
8. Q – For information on the customer interface, I presume you are seeking details on the 'human' interface for problem reporting/resolution rather than technical interface specifications?
The customer service interface is that portion of the Responder’s technical approach that is to be used for providing the service both to NOAA and to its subscribers.  This interface may include scheduling requests for service, changing or terminating service, reporting trouble with the service, or requesting information about the service, data processing issues, data retrieval problems etc.  NOAA would be willing to consider whatever ideas the vendor chooses to propose.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) is contemplating extending the current contract with IBM Global Services, Inc. for application engineering and technical support services for the USCB Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS) for 27 months beyond the contract period. The current contract expires on June 30, 2005.   This action represents a continuation of service beyond the limit of the existing DADS contract options.  The DADS program has been developed and maintained by IBM for the past seven years. This extension is deemed necessary for the USCB to develop a long term solution for its data collection activities.  It is the USCB's belief that IBM is the only capable source to provide DADS services within the required time frame at an acceptable level of risk and
cost to continue data dissemination operations until the USCB determines its long term solution. However, interested companies who believe they can meet this requirement  should view the Statement of Work for the current contract at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html, and show clear
and convincing evidence that they have the capability to provide the above described services. Interested companies should submit technical capabilities, business size, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the USCB requirement.  Please forward this information to eric.wayne.franklin@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465
by November 5, 2004.  While this is not a request for competitive
proposals, responses received in response to this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.  No telephone requests will be accepted. No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice.  If no responses are received, the current contract with IBM may be extended for 27 months (for two one-year options) without further notice.

<DESC>This procurement action is anticipated to be sole-source under FAR 6.302-1, based on Ms. Allen's extensive knowledge of the complex and specialized nature  of matters relating to the life cycle analysis of major weapon systems (such as  Future Combat Systems (FCS), Excalibur, PGMM, Colored grenades, etc);  environmental life cycle costing; industrial base policy; strategies;  assessment; and plans; management accounting; business models; defense  marketing; heavy metal issues; life cycle assessment tools; etc. To bring  another contractor to Ms. Allen's current level of expertise would result in  unacceptable delays and require duplication of costs not expected to be  recovered through competitive procurement procedures.  Anticipated contract type will be either Firm Fixed Price or Time and Material.

<DESC>Correction:  Currently this solicitation is for 5 years and $5 million.  A request for approval to increase the term and capacity of the resultant contract to 6 years and $6 million has been filed with the Office of Principal Assistant Responsible fo r Contracting (OPARC), WASH DC.  If term and capacity increase for this contract is approved, the resultant contract will be awarded for 6 years and in an amount not to exceed $6 million. Correction: The minimum guarantee amount during the base period will be 2%, and the minimum guarantee for the option years will be 1% for this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quanity , IDIQ contract.   Effective as of January 1, 2005 On-line Electronic Representations and Certifications, OCRA, are required by contractors.  Contractors must be CCR registered before going to the following OCRA website.   http://orca.bpn.gov/ The website states you have to be CCR registered to fill out the Certs and reps for the solicitations and bid on a solicitation.  Click on the OCRA link to the left of the page.  under NOTE: It says that the contractor must be CCR registered in order to co mplete the online certs and reps. The FAR has changed to incorporate this change.   The following link should explain and clear up any questions on the certs and reps.  http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/changes/fac/fac2001-26.htm   Item I--Electronic Representations and Certifications (FAR Case 2002-024) This final rule requires offerors to provide representations and certifications electronically via the BPN website; to update the representations and certifications as necessary, but at least annually, to keep them current, accurate and complete; and to ma ke changes that affect only one solicitation by completing the appropriate sections of either paragraph (j) of FAR provision 52.212-3 or FAR provision 52.204-8, whichever is included in the solicitation. This change represents a conversion of a paper-based  process to a more efficient electronic process to obtain offerors' representations and certifications. It will also significantly reduce the paperwork burden for both offerors and contracting officers.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: Technical Assistance Center for Mental Health Promotion and the Prevention of Youth Violence 
Project Description:  The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a technical assistance center that will support three federally funded initiatives: Safe Schools/Healthy Students (a collaborative partnership with the Departments of Education and Justice), Youth Violence Prevention, and TCE: Prevention and Early Intervention. Each requires collaborative partnerships across service organizations and the application of evidence-based prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. The focus of this procurement will be to:
1.	Provide multifaceted technical assistance across a wide variety of topics, including concepts and policies related to school safety, school and community-based prevention and treatment, early childhood development, system change, leadership development, community coalition building, sustainability, program evaluation, mental health services delivery and transformation, evidence-based clinical interventions, evidence-based prevention, juvenile justice, law enforcement, family involvement, school-community-family partnerships, substance abuse and co-occurring disorders/prevention, and youth leadership; 
2.	Provide centralized administration, management, and coordination of TA services for all grantees; 
3.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) of the Department of Education intends to award a one (1) year sole source contract with a one (1) year option at the discretion of the government.  The contractor is Accenture.  This contract will fulfill the requirements for requirements analysis, development, testing, operations, maintenance, technical support, and documentation in support of the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system.  COD supports the origination and disbursement of funds for the Pell Grant and Direct Loans programs to post-secondary schools and students.  FSA believes that Accenture is the only source possessing the necessary existing information, resources, and expertise to meet the program requirements within the time required by FSA.  As a result of a competitive procurement, FSA recently awarded a contract for the integration of COD into a new financial aid delivery system referred to as the Front End Integration (FEBI) system; reference website http://febi.ed.gov/library.htm for more information on COD and how it relates to FEBI.  On the referenced website, scroll down until you see the Section titled "ORIGINATION AND DISBURSEMENT" and the paragraph that follows titled "Common Origination and Disbursement System Documentation."  The contract that FSA intends to award to Accenture is necessary to continue services for COD until the new FEBI system is in production.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting a market research of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully support a Replacement of the Tempest High Level Detection System (HLDS).   

The Required Salient Characteristics For The Replacement Of The Tempest High
Level Detection System (Hlds) Or Equal are as follows:

General Description:

The HLDS shall be designed to detect low levels of modulation (both AM,
FM and Vector Modulations; add-ons, and future upgrades to include
Virtual Modulation [VirtM] capabilities) in the output of emitters
operating from DC to 2 GHz. The modulation components may then be
displayed as a video signal, or applied through an internal audio
amplifier to a headset, oscilloscope, or spectrum analyzer. The
equipment is intended for use connected directly to an RF source, and is
capable of being used at power levels of up to 5 watts continuously; 100
watts maximum with the use of external attenuators.

The HLDS shall be a self-contained unit within a shielded case. The case
in turn shall be designed to be self-standing, or rack-mounted in a
19-inch rack, which may be used on a test bench or in a field application.  Either 115Vac/60Hz, or 220 Vac/50Hz shall power the HLDS.

Functional Use:

The HLDS shall provide a means of detecting and displaying (visually or
aurally) low-level amplitude, frequency, or vector modulation components
on the RF output of a radio transmitter.  Any detected modulation
components are amplified, as necessary, and applied to an oscilloscope
or spectrum analyzer for visual observation.  The output may also be
applied as an audio signal to suitable external monitoring or recording
equipment if desired.

Interface Requirements:

There shall be a front panel jack(s) on the HLDS for IF, Video and aural
monitoring:
*  Interface to external test instruments, i.e., oscilloscopes, spectrum
analyzers, etc.
*  IF Path Jumper for injecting an external test IF.
·	Headset jack for aural monitoring.

Companies interested in responding to this request for information should mail the following:  a company pamphlet, brochure, or short statement of the company’s abilities/history with this type of service, the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company’s address.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters. In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP). This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population. The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency. 

*** DESCRIPTION *** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. Bacillus anthracis is considered among the most-likely biological agent threat confronting the national security of the United States. B. anthracis is particularly effective in inducing disease when spores are released as an aerosol. The primary mortality and morbidity of B. anthracis is mediated through a toxemia. Antibiotics target the vegetative B. anthracis bacteria but antitoxins are necessary to neutralize the effects of the toxins and ensure a more successful therapeutic outcome. DHHS is seeking to be advised of the availability of commercial products, or products in advanced development, for therapeutic treatments, directed at anthrax toxemia. These products may include immunotherapeutics or small molecular entity treatments.  Data obtained from this RFI will inform DHHS’s next round of procurements for anthrax therapeutics. Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS. New respondents should submit the following information about their product:: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indications for use (e.g. pre or post exposure prophylaxis or treatment); e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies; i) Timeline for submitting IND package to FDA. Those who have responded previously need only supply updates. All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law

Information must be submitted by April 15, 2005. Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and should be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, phone 202-401-3693, email darrick.early@hhs.gov; and to Susan Peacock, M.S., phone 202-401-6343, email susan.peacock@hhs.gov. Please ensure that at least one (1) COPY of all responses are submitted: one to the technical contact person, Susan Peacock, and one to the primary point of contact, Darrick A. Early.

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2(c)(7)(C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<SUBJECT>D -- Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS)
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) is contemplating entering into a sole source contract with IBM Global Services, Inc. for application engineering and technical support services for its Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS).  This action represents a continuation of service beyond the limit of the existing DADS contract options until a full and open competition is conducted and a contract for the follow-on Integrated Dissemination System (IDS) program is awarded.  The current contract expires on June 30, 2005.  The DADS program has been developed and maintained by IBM for the past seven years. This sole source contract will be for a period of up to 27 months in order to complete the RFP for IDS, run a full and open competition on IDS, and allow a transition period.  It is the USCB's belief that IBM is the only capable source to provide DADS services within the required timeframe at an acceptable level of risk and cost to continue data dissemination operations until the IDS vendor is selected.  Interested companies having the capability to provide the above-described services should submit, via email, their capability statement to eric.wayne.franklin@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465 within 15 days of this notice.  Interested companies may view the Statement of Work for FY2005 of the current contract at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html.  While this is not a request for competitive proposals, responses received within 15 days from the posting of this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice, however the statements will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the USCB.  If no responses are received, a sole source contract with IBM for a one-year base period with options for up to an additional 15 months will be pursued without further notice.

<SUBJECT>--PLANNING, EVALUATION, ANALYSIS, AND GUIDANCE FOR US ARMY HEALTH FACILITIES PLANNING AGENCY PROGRAMS
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY FOR PLANNING, EVALUATION, ANALYSIS, AND GUIDANCE FOR US ARMY HEALTH FACILITIES PLANNING AGENCY PROGRAMS   POC: For further information, contact Jacalyn Jenkins 251-441-5598. The NAICS CODE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT IS 541618. The Mobile Dist rict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity type Task Order Contract with Mitretek Systems, Inc., McLean, VA, as a nonprofit, conflict-of-interest free source, who does not compete for design or cons truction projects for private or government entities, and who has a high degree of expertise in the military medical and medical/biosafety laboratory fields to provide support for strategic planning, program policy analysis, and decision-making support for  the US Army Health Facilities Planning Agency.  The following types of services are required: detailed market analysis and healthcare planning; economic analysis for capital improvement decisions; special studies related to changing healthcare requirement s; program management support and facilitation, acquisition assistance; and advice to the government with regard to emerging technologies, shifts in practice trends, alternative future scenarios and funding strategies, etc.  Respondents must demonstrate a broad capability in the medical and biodefense laboratory fields, including experience in high-level policy making, guidance and regulatory compliance.  This procurement will be subject to stringent organizational conflict-of-interest provisions and respon dents must demonstrate an absence of such conflicts.  That is, the respondent is not engaged in other activities or relationships which would make the respondent unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or th e respondents objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the respondent has an unfair competitive advantage. The Health Facilities Planning Agency (HFPA) is responsible for the planning and execution of facility-related investments for hospitals, clinics, research and other medically-related facilities world-wide.  HFPA is seeking support with its initiatives to:  assess planning and capital requirements for Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) installations in selected markets and  multi- markets;  recapitalize the existing Army medical care delivery, medical research, and biodefense laboratory inventory; shape and im prove facilities in order to respond quickly and efficiently to the ever-changing face of Army and Military Health System (MHS) requirements; identify and use alternative business practices to leverage private industry capital in the development of Army fa cility projects; and, research emerging facility technologies and find opportunities to incorporate these technologies into the Army healthcare facility life cycle management process. The contractor shall assist HFPA in gathering the information needed to acquire, allocate, and manage resources for HFPA military functions.  The contractor may be required to assist HFPA in considering and addressing impacts to its program as a result of troops restationing, BRAC announcements, and coordination and interfacing with the Services in multi-service markets.  The contractor will assist HFPA in conducting special studies, investigations, or focused analyses on a variety of healthcare related iss ues and topics.  These analyses may involve a focused area of inquiry or may involve assessment of a broad set of topics.  Such investigations will feature preparation of a special output document(s) which include policy recommendations and/or actionable i tems/recommendations that should be pursued and that can be referenced by HFPA. In order to support HFPA in managing its program, the following characteristics will be required of the contractor: "	Independent and Objective.  To ensure credibility, consistency, and defensibility, the evaluation of contractor performance must be  free of any perceived or actual bias, free from conflict of interest, and based on the best possible analysis and expertise.  It is imperative that there be no potential for a conflict of interest on the part of the organization providing the required ess ential technical capability.  HFPA must be able to trust this organization with sensitive, government-proprietary information without concern for its misuse. "	Access to HFPA Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition Information.  Some activities require extensive access to planning, budgeting, and acquisition information.  Given the frequent restructuring of corporate ownership, it is difficult to ensure that the r elease of sensitive information to a profit-seeking entity is not going to eventually undermine the integrity of current or future procurements.  Even if there is no actual harm, the appearance of a conflict of interest could severely handicap HFPAs abili ty to act.  Actual organizational conflict of interest is not eliminated completely by temporary exclusion clauses that attempt to separate conflict-free portions of a company from other parts that could gain a competitive advantage through access to sen sitive information, and none of these measures are effective against the appearance of a conflict of interest. "	Need for an Impartial Advisor.  There are many competing priorities within the HFPA operating entities and the requirement exists to engage an organization that can provide objective assessments and recommendations on both external and internal positions .  There is a continuing need to establish an objective resource to help HFPA sort out internal priorities and to represent a credible, independent input to the program management process.  This resource must have access to sensitive information and key de cision makers, and have the mandate to provide neutral ground where internal priority conflicts can be examined and fairly resolved. "	Continuity of Effort.  Informed program management decisions require enlightened advice based on broad, in-depth, and enduring knowledge of the HFPA corporate culture and way of doing business.  The use of a profit-seeking contractor to provide such cont inuity would be unwise in this situation because it would be difficult to maintain continuity without giving unfair competitive advantage and inhibiting appropriate free and open competition. To fulfill its responsibilities with the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness, HFPA requires the support of an organization that can simultaneously: "	Provide a general program management support, which it has successfully applied to other large and complex systems, "	Have access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to government and private sector data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities, and "	Operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence and with freedom from any organizational conflict of interest. The support of an experienced, conflict free contractor is particularly important to HFPA when its policy choices and decision making have long range and far reaching implications. This support will be used to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of HFPA, but it will not be used to perform inherently governmental functions or when the need can be met as effectively with in house resources or by other contra ct support gained via competition.  The contractor will be used when continuity of effort is critical, when the contractor possesses a unique and essential knowledge base, and/or when it is necessary to have access to sensitive or proprietary information, including strategic planning information.  The contractor will also be used when the nature of the work is such that it must be performed by an entity operating in the public interest, without profit motive, with objectivity and independence, and with free dom from organizational conflicts of inter est. The resultant contracts performance period will be a one-year base period with 4, on-year options.  This office believes that only one source, Mitretek Systems, Inc., can provide all of the above required support.  If any responsible source other than Mit retek Systems, Inc. can fulfill all of the above requirements, written notification and supporting documentation may be submitted in writing to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C(Jacalyn M. Jenkins), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-000 1 or jacalyn.m.jenkins@sam.usace.army.mil.  To be considered a viable source, documentation must clearly demonstrate: (1) freedom from actual or potential conflict-of-interest (2) extensive knowledge in each of the areas described in the requirements above  (3) past history detailing any contracts that your company is currently performing or has completed that would be considered the same as/similar to the type of services described above.  Include the contract number, type of contract, dollar value, perform ance location, contract length, government point of contact and current phone number and (6) positive indication that your firm does not compete or bid for design, construction, or construction management project for private or government entities, and doe s not perform as a subcontractor for firms who do compete on these projects.  If no affirmative written documentation is received within 15 calendar days of this synopsis, USACE will proceed with negotiations to issue a contract to Mitretek Systems, Inc. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of six months from the date of publication of this notice. A soli citation is not available.

<SUBJECT>--Sole Source Modification:  ANDE Technologies Training and Consultation
<DESC>A sole source modification to contract W911S6-04-P-0224 to increase the level of effort is contemplated with Mr. Michael Keleher, 2645 Wild Turkey Lane, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. Mr. Keleher has provided non-personal consultation and training services for the Defense Threat Reduction Agencys Op Eval 2 program, which focuses on advanced nondestructive evaluation (ANDE) technologies and devices.    The additional level of effort (no  more than $40,000) required by this contract action is for the evaluation of the effectiveness of training and whether the test group has retained their learning several months after it occurred.  DTRA has scheduled three additional exercises for the test  group involved in the initial level of effort, requiring DPGs support in the evaluation of the test groups abilities. Mr. Keleher has been directly involved in the development of the ANDE technologies and the work expended to date on contract W911S6-05- P-0224.  The participation by any other, if any, technically qualified individuals in the additional level of effort would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and losses of several million dollars to the program.   10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The basis for the authority cited are as follows: Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued pro vision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition The point of contact concerning this action is  Mr. Eric S.

We envision that this would bring together government, industry and academia in tackling some of the fundamental science underpinning the complex information netw ork issues that will be such a vital facet of future coalition military operations and engage the partners in a collaborative environment to fully exploit the joint development of emerging technologies.  ARL and MoD will conduct  Opportunity Conferences (OC) for industry and academia as part of the joint United States/United Kingdom  ITA  (see related announcement in FedBizOpps Special Notice dated 23 November 2004).There will be two Opportunity Conference s, one in the Washington DC Metro Area on 01 April 2005 and one in the London, England Metro Area on 07 April 2005 in order to prepare consortia of industry and academia from both nations in developing proposals to become participants in the ITA program. Additional information on the ITA program and the Opportunity Conferences is posted to the website http://www.usukita.com/ and will also appear in future notices.   Under the ITA fundamental research will be sought in network theory, Security Across a System of Systems, Sensor Information Delivery, and Distributed Coalition Planning and Decision Making.  Emphasis is on the synergistic combination of these technologies  in support of a tactical coalition force.  The ITA program will also provide a mechanism that will allow for the transition of the fundamental research results to military and commercial applications. Our vision is for the ITA to be modeled on the US Army Research Laboratorys Collaborative Technology Alliances (CTAs) as well as the UK Ministry of Defences Defence Technology Centres (DTCs).  The CTAs utilize Cooperative Agreements linked to task order contracts to facilitate basic and applied research and ultimately the transition of those research results to military and commercial applications.  The CTAs involve other US Government Agencies and are focused on transformation of new technologies.  Addit ional information on the CTAs can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/alliances.  Defence Technology Centres are formal collaborative arrangement between industry and academic experts in a particular technology, defined and funded jointly by participants a nd the MOD. The Defence Technology Centres work within a formal contractual framework that facilitates collaboration and provides the opportunity to meet the needs of participating stakeholders via agreed goals. Additional information on the Defence Techno logy Centres can be found at http://www.dtc.mod.uk. A Draft ITA Program Bulletin is expected to be published in early March 2005.  The ITA program will be limited to US and UK entities.  The winning consortium will be required to have membership from both the US and UK, with a strong emphasis on collaborati on among the members.  Potential consortium leads will be required to have an existing significant research and development (R&D) capability in both the US and UK.  Organizations interested in participating in the ITA are requested to register their intere st on the ITA website. A similar announcement is being made in the UK.

<SUBJECT>--Revision of Teleproduction, Preproduction and Production Services for Spirit of America 2005 in Washington DC and two other venue locations yet to be determined as posted on 18 February 2005.
<DESC>Offerors  must be capable of providing: (1)  Large-format video display screen system, measuring 25 feet high by 48 feet wide, with a team of personnel trained and experienced in its operation. It must be able to display multiple images simultaneousl y without distortions or uneven brightness, and the images it presents must be clearly viewable from a wide viewing angle, up to 180 degrees.  The screen must also be able to display images of high enough resolution to eliminate any pixelation when viewed from as close as thirty (30) feet.  The screen must incorporate a customized rigging system able to support both static and dynamic screen implementations, including lifting the screen during the performance so that Army vehicles can pass under it to enter  the performance floor, while ensuring the safety of cast, crew and audience.  The rigging system must be capable of positioning the screen at specified heights, accurate to within one-half of an inch.  A screen surround system must also be incorporated, i n order to integrate the screen into the physical environment of the show.  (2)  A readily accessible database of digital images that can be drawn from to build the graphic screen display component of the production, with a team of personnel trained and ex perienced in its operation.  The images must be formatted to fit the SOA main viewing screen at a very high level of resolution, such that they are viewable with no pixelation from as close as thirty (30) feet.  The images must be of sufficient quality and  variety to offer numerous choices for visual complement to the following general themes, as they are developed into specific storylines by the Executive Producer and the script writing team. (3)  Suitable equipment and facilities for the digital programmi ng and editing of the wide-screen component of the show, with a team of personnel trained and experienced in its operation.  The equipment needed will include digital processing equipment, show control software, and display technologies that replicate the dimensions of the wide-screen, but on a smaller scale.  The wide-screen display must be pre-programmed so that it will be shown in exact synchronization with all elements of the production, to include the live music, recorded music, speaking parts, visual effects, sound effects, lighting effects, set movement, and cast movement.  This synchronization must be accurate to within a fraction of a second. (4)  A demonstrated ability to successfully integrate all the technical and operational components of a show  comparable in size and complexity to SOA.  This would entail coordinating the activities and output of at least twelve functional departments by the service provider, to include project management, show direction, script writing, visual design, sound effe cts design, lighting design, scenic design, sound system design, show logistics, technical direction, video direction, and projection.  It would also entail coordinating each of the above departments with their Army counterparts/points of contact, to inclu de MDW (Commanding General, Ceremonies and Special Events, Special Projects, Provost Marshal, Public Affairs, Operations, Safety, Logistics, and Protocol); The Old Guard (Commander, Liaison Officer, Operations, Logistics, Communications and Spotlight Team,  Rappell Team, Armorer & Weapons Team, Stage Crew, Actor Management Crew, Cast, Drill Team, Caisson, Colonial Color Guard, and Fife and Drum Corps); The US Army Band (Commander, Logistics Representative, Marching Band/Drum Major, and Orchestra/Conductor/Mu sic Arranger); and the Army Visual Information Directorate.  Furthermore, it would entail the integration of all the technical systems of the production, to include lighting, music, acting, voice-overs, large-screen video program, small-screen live video f eed, sound effects, animals, vehicles, rappellers, live weapons firing, pyrotechnics, and moving scenery. (5)  Contractors must be located  within 30 miles (app roximately one hours driving time) of the District of Columbia.  This is essential to ensure the contractor is capable of handling short-notice issues and changes as required by the Military District of Washington. Contractor capabilities statements for providing the above services are to be submitted to Vicki J.Walker, Capital District Contracting Center at walkervi@belvoir.army.mil by 1400 hours (2:00 PM) 3 March 2005.

Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)           The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

HSAR 3052.209-70           PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003).(a) 
Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

Evaluation Process: Award will be made to the responsible contractor whose offer conforms to this request and is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government considering price and non-price factors.  Accordingly, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the low Offeror based on the following criteria:

Technical Proposal
Total Evaluated Price Proposal

Technical Proposal is significantly more important than price and consists of the following factors:

Factor A – Past Performance 50%
Factor B – Technical Merit 50%

Technical proposal shall not exceed 20 single sided pages of 8-½ X 11-size paper with 12 pitch.  Brochures or other pre-printed material may be submitted.  If pre-printed material is submitted it is required to be included in the 20 pages.  

The Technical Proposal will be evaluated using the following rating criteria:

Exceptional (E) – The proposal exceeds the requirements and provides an exceptional or outstanding approach that fully satisfies the Government requirements. A complete understanding of the solicitation is demonstrated.  Award could be made without exchanges with the Offeror.  

Acceptable (A) – The proposal fully satisfies the requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the solicitation. All elements are adequately addressed. Minor weaknesses may be noted, however, award could be made without exchanges with the Offeror. 

Marginal (M) – The proposal does not fully meet the requirements. Minor deficiencies are identified which could indicate an insufficient understanding of the requirements.  With minor revisions or clarifications the proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming technically acceptable.  

Unacceptable (U) – The proposal fails to satisfy the requirements and the approach contains an unacceptable level of risk to the Government.  Major deficiencies have been identified which would require major revision or re-write.  Without major revision or re-write the proposal does not have a reasonable chance of becoming technically acceptable. 

Factor A – Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will consider recent, relevant sources, context, and trends. Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror to successfully meet the requirements as set forth in this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to obtain information in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources.  Offerors must provide the following information regarding past performance:  submit information on up to three projects (not older than three (3) years) that demonstrate performance on work that is similar in scope, size (or larger) and complexity to the work described in this solicitation (Municipal, public, school pools).  Past performance information must include: location where work was performed, point of contact and point of contact telephone number, and contract number.  Include awards, customer letters of commendation, etc., with point of contact and telephone numbers.  

Factor B – Technical Qualifications: Offeror must submit the design layout of the proposed work, material to be used, and the technical solution for the overall work completed. Provide preparation requirements and installation details from the manufacturer of the equipment.  The Government requires warranties on all equipment, paints, and labor.  Warranty periods offered in excess of the minimum specified will receive favorable consideration.

<DESC>Due date for proposals is extended to 03 March 2005, 9:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time. If necessary a second and final question and answer amendment to the solicitation will be issued on 24 February 2005.  All technical questions must be submitted to this office by 23 February 2005, 4:00 pm, Mountain Standard Time (MST) in order to be includ ed in the second amendment.  Technical questions received after 4:00 pm MST 23 February 2005 will not be accepted or considered.     If you plan to request a site visit you must notify this office no later than 4:00 pm MST 23 February 2005.   Responses to questions asked by quoters are as follows.  Q1)   Please verify the input/output ratings for the Exeltech 10 kVa and 5 kVa inverters (i.e. -48 VDC in / 120 VAC out etc.). A1)  Input/output ratings are -48VDC in and 120 VAC out.  Q2)    Are the Inverters being installed in a 19 inch or 23 inch rack (or do we need to quote racks)?  This will affect the configuration of the inverter shelves. A2)  All power equipment (except batteries) are mounted in a self standing 23 inch cabinet which is anchored to the floor of the shelter.  Q3)  Do the existing Exeltech inverters have alarm cards or transfer switches? A3)   Existing Exceltech invertors have built in alarms.  Q4)      Do they want N + 1 redundancy or just straight 10 kVa and 5 kVa inverters? A4) Straight 10 kVa ( 10 - 1 kVa invertors) and straight 5kVa (5 - 1 kVa invertors).  Q5)    Eltek can provide exact matches for the DC power systems.  However, they have a newer version of the same equipment.  Would you be interested in a quote on one or the other or both? A5)  Require exact matches for the DC power system to be compatible with existing systems. One quote.  Q6)  GNB Batteries,  I have model number, was looking for string specs and configuration.  Are there drawings of the location w/ existing systems available?  Additionally, looking for cabling distances so that we can get proper gauge.      A6)  GNB Batteries - MDL 100A21 - 1000 ampere hour per string x 2 strings,          - 24 cells in each string,         - No drawings available,         - 4/0 gauge wire with one cable per polarity was used in previous applications         Q7)   Is a pre-bid site walk through an option?  Can a walk through be scheduled if we desire? A7)   A pre-bid walk through is possible, but not at the actual installation site. The communications shelter is not scheduled to be delivered until 7 March 2005 and firm power needs to be installed to the shelter once delivered and accepted. However, ther e are existing sites nearby which are representative of the type of DC power system we require (may not have the same battery configuration as the 2 string requirement) but all of the other power equipment is the same. The shelter dimensions for the new in stallation are 16' wide x 24' long x 10' high and the batteries and power equipment are co-located in the same area within the shelter.
