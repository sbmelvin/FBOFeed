<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is issuing a solicitation (negotiated) for the purpose of requesting proposals for providing a Rio Grande silvery minnow sanctuary to aid in its recovery.  This sanctuary will mimic river habitats to enhance captive propagation of the silvery minnow.  Parts of the sanctuary have already been constructed.  During this final phase, the pump station will be completed and all piping to the sanctuary will be installed.  Additionally, a filter building and outlet structure will be constructed.  Once completed, water from the Albuquerque Riverside Drain will be pumped through the Rio Grande levee to a filter building.  Leaving the filter building, the water will travel through a constructed channel comprised with habitat features and backwater areas.  At the end of the channel is an outlet structure which will screen the water to keep silvery minnow within the sanctuary.  From there, the water can be diverted back to the Albuquerque Riverside Drain or be discharged to the Rio Grande.  This job requires knowledge and expertise in a variety of construction disciplines:  concrete, earthwork, pipelaying, masonry blocks, plumbing, and electrical.  After completion of construction, the Contractor will be required to provide training on the operations and maintenance of the installed components.  Many of these components will be warranted from one to three years after construction.  The work is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  A site visit is tentatively scheduled for September 26, 2007, at 9:00 a.m.  The confirmed date will be listed in the solicitation.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 237990.  The contract will be firm-fixed price.  Approximate date of solicitation issuance is September 12, 2007.   A free copy of the drawings may be obtained by sending a fax or e-mail request to Estephanie Singleton at (801) 524-3857 or esingleton@uc.usbr.gov.  Refer to the Solicitation name and number in your request, include your DUN's and TIN, phone and fax numbers, company name and address.  Prospective vendors must register in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR web site, http://www.ccr.gov. or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>On October 6, 2007 Robins Air Force Base will once again be hosting Tops In Blue in the Warner Robins Civic Center. The Tops In Blue team will perform before an audience of more than 600 people. The show is free of charge and open to the general public. The audience will primarily consist of active duty military and their family members.
Tops In Blue is composed of 36 of the most talented active duty US Air Force vocalists, musicians, and dancers worldwide. Tops In Blue is one of the oldest and most widely traveled entertainment groups of its kind. The 2007 tour will take Tops In Blue throughout the United States and to more than 27 countries, with a total of over 140 performances over a 9-month period. The Tops In Blue team puts in a lot of hard work for each show, not only during, but before each and every show they are responsible for setting up over 40,000 pounds of staging, audio, lighting, and special effects equipment required for each performance. 
This year is going to be special for us here in Warner Robins as well as the Tops In Blue performers as the show will be commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Air Force. For this exciting production we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash and in-kind gifts to offset the costs of food to feed the team at the meet and greet on October 5th and the continental breakfast, lunch and after show dinner on October 6th. We want to ensure the members receive the sort of trademark welcome that Middle Georgia is famous for giving guests to our community.  
Would your company like to be a part of the Tops In Blue performance again this year?  If so, we can offer you possible logo and/or name recognition in promotional event materials, our Services Edge magazine (9,000 published per month), our Services website, the Rev-Up (20,000 published per week) and even on an event thank you sign.  (All opportunities above are dependent on the total value of your donation.) Those interested in participating should contact Laticia Little no later than October 3, 2007.  If you would like more information or should have any questions, please contact me at (478) 926-6629 or (478) 926-5492. Thank you for your time and consideration.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial items to be acquired under FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any amendments or other pertinent information. Solicitation FA8751-07-Q-0554 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-19 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20070828. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set aside under NAICS code 334111 and small business size standard of 1000 employees.

In addition, the system will have to backup data from a variety of platforms including Solaris, Linux, MacOS, and MS Windows. The Tolis Group bruApp R7500 is a complete, turn key disk backup system using Linux operating system which can be integrated easily and rapidly with existing OFS hardware and software. It provides client support for all required platforms and can perform unattended backups during off hours through a scheduling mechanism. Tolis is the only known source that offers a complete disk based backup system that supports all required client platforms at a reasonable cost.

The estimated delivery date is 30 days after award. The place of delivery, acceptance, and FOB destination point is AFRL/IF, 148 Electronic Pkwy, Rome NY 13441-4516.

Software/Hardware upgrade to existing Manual and Bulk Storage Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). The WMS consists of three independent areas that house 21 White System carousels; 20 are twin bins and the last being a standard horizontal carousel.

PickPro is a Windows-based Warehousing control application that serves as the liaison between the WMS, the host system, and manual carousels; thus, automating the inventory-related tasks improving inventory accuracy and reducing manual man-hours required to complete the task.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for two Mossbauer Spectometer MIMOS II instruments. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Space and Earth Science Instrumentation (SPESI) for the following reasons: 1) SPESI is the only vendor in the world that makes the      required flight instrument, and    2) The SPESI instrument operation is different from standard labratory instruments because of its small size and the backscatter measurement geometry, which are required by the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Mission Team.  The small size is a requirement in order to produce exact and equivalent measurements to that of the Mission.  The backscatter geometry is required so that rock services (with and without coating) can be analyzed analogous to operations on the Martian surface.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 13, 2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal, a solicitation, a request for quote or an indication that the Government will contract for the items provided by submitter.

Initial stages of this effort are already underway within CPSG, with support from NSA, and have recently produced an early version of the specification.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested. The CPSG CMPO requests that industry request a copy of the draft specification from Mr. Dan Lanz, CPSG/ZXE (MITRE), via email at dlanz@mitre.org, phone (781) 271-2304.  CPSG CMPO would like your comments NLT 5 September 2007 via e-mail to Mr. Lanz.  Mr Lanz  will also be the point of contact for any clarifying questions.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiologic Branch (OEB), plans to procure, on a sole source basis, for the analysis of the mutational spectrum of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene from the case-control study of bladder cancer among men and women ?New England Study of Environment and Health (NESEH)? from Transgenomic, Inc., 12325 Emmet Street, Omaha, NE 68164. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. The purpose of the study is to investigate a number of environmental, occupational, and personal risk factors for bladder cancer.   OEB has collected  formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks which were sectioned onto slides in preparation for microdissection and DNA extraction from each subject with an incident diagnosis of bladder cancer.  OEEB is planning to pilot test molecular analyses using DNA from these cases to determine if the quality and quantity of DNA is suitable for mutational spectrum and epigenetic assays.   Pathology tissue from cancer patients provides increasing opportunities for the study of biological questions relevant to tumor etiology and for detecting early markers of disease and progression.  Pathology specimens provide a resource for examining DNA, proteins and RNA in tissue and can be used to compare tumors that are associated with different risk factors, thus strengthening associations that might be made between exposures and disease to strengthen causal inference and identify determinants of survival.  Transgenomic will complete the following tasks: 1) DNA shall be isolated and quantitative PCR measurements analyzed using three 5-micron tissue sections on slides that were sectioned from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks that have been microdissected and placed in 1.5ml tubes;  2)  DNA shall be quantitated using quantitative PCR technology and the amount of non-degraded, PCR amplifiable DNA will be measured and reported;  3)  Mutation screening of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene shall be screened using Surveyor endonuclease. Digests by capillary electrophoresis, double stranded sequencing, and sequence analysis shall be conducted and analyzed by the contractor;  4)  For mutant samples, the specific exon, codon, and type of mutation (amino acid change, deletion, and insertion) shall be reported to the PO in an electronic format using MS Excel.  Samples without mutations shall be reported as not having mutations. The reports shall be provided three months after receipt of samples;  5)   All chromatograms and sequencing traces shall be included as electronic files with all reports; and 6)  If samples fail to sequence, re-amplification at no additional charge to the government shall be completed at least two times if sufficient DNA is available or can be provided by the PO.  Transgenomic, Inc. is the only contractor known to the NCI that is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they have developed a unique technological approach using a combination of Surveyor Endonuclease, an optimized derivative of Cel I endonuclease and the patented WAVE? system to separate fragments based upon size which make this method uniquely suitable for high-throughput analysis of large numbers of samples.  The quality control and their technological approach are best for the mutation detection of large numbers of samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the technology used by Transgenomic will provide results that are more informative in a timely manner. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI Researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT September 11, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist, at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed to 301-402-4513.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiologic Branch (OEB), plans to procure, on a sole source basis, for the analysis of the mutational spectrum of exons 1-3 of the VHL gene for 200 DNA samples extracted from paraffin embedded formalin fixed (FFPE) slides.  For 30% of these samples, (N=60), promoter hypermethylation analysis of the VHL gene will also be conducted from Transgenomic, Inc., 12325 Emmet Street, Omaha, NE 68164. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. The incidence rates of kidney cancer vary substantially across Central and Eastern Europe, from a low of 9.0 per 100,000 men in Bucharest to a high of 17.0 per 100,000 men in the Czech Republic in the early 1990s. The diverse incidence rates may in part be due to a wide range of environmental exposures, but the specific reasons are unclear.   The variation in exposure levels to occupational carcinogens in this part of the world present a unique opportunity to assess occupational risks for cancer. In 2000, investigators at NCI in collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) launched a case-control study of kidney cancer in six centers in Central and Eastern European countries (I.E., Bucharest, Romania; Brno, Olomouc, and Prague, Czech Republic; Lodz, Poland; and Moscow, Russia) to evaluate cancer risks in relation to ifestyle factors, and history of exposures to known or suspected occupational and  environmental, carcinogens.  Collection of questionnaire data from the Eastern European Renal Cell Case-Control study was completed in 2002. NCI has collected formalin fixed-paraffin embedded and frozen tumor material from approximately 80% of cases.  Specific objectives of this project are:  1)  Conduct VHL mutational spectrum analysis using tumor DNA samples collected from FFPE tissue from RCC cases enrolled in the Central and Eastern European RCC case-control study and 2)  Conduct promoter hypermethylation analysis using the bilsulfilte treated DNA and sequence analysis.  The contractor shall:  1)  isolated and quantitative PCR measurements analyzed using three 5-micron tissue sections on slides that were cut from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks that have been microdissected and placed in 1.5ml tubes;  2)  Mutation screening of exons 1-3 of the VHL gene shall be screened using Surveyor nuclease. Digests by capillary electrophoresis, double stranded sequencing, and sequence analysis shall be conducted and analyzed by the contractor;  3)  For mutant samples, the specific exon, codon, and type of mutation (amino acid change, deletion, and insertion) shall be reported to the PO in an electronic format using MS Excel.  The reports shall be provided three months after receipt of samples;  4)  For samples that do not exhibit VHL mutations in exon 1-3, promoter hypermethylation analysis shall be conducted.  Promoter hypermethylation analysis shall also be conducted on approximately 10% of samples (randomly selected by the project officer) that had VHL mutations;  5)  For samples that will have promoter hypermetylation analyzed, DNA shall be bisulfite treated and genomic sequencing conducted;  6)  A summary report shall be provided for the VHL methylation analysis that will describe the methylation status of ten CpG sites within the VHL promoter.  Results from all samples shall be provided. Failed samples including the reason for failure, those without mutation and putative variants shall be indicated for all samples received.  Reports shall be confidentially provided to the Project Officer at 3 month intervals.  All chromatograms and sequencing traces shall be included as electronic files with all reports; and  7)  If samples fail to sequence, re-amplification at no additional charge to the government shall be completed at least two times if sufficient DNA is available or can be provided by the PO. Transgenomic successfully completed and was awarded procurement MQ515240 to conduct VHL mutational spectrum analysis and a pilot study of VHL promoter hypermethylation for the Central and Eastern European RCC study using frozen and FFPE tumor tissue DNA .  Because of the success of this study and because their analysis methods are high-throughput and more recently have proven successful on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue DNA, we can successfully expand the previous study to include an additional 200 cases that provided FFPE tumor blocks only.  For comparability of these results to those of the previous study it is essential that  Transgenomic Inc. to conduct the analysis of these samples as to avoid the introduction of new variables into on going research.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI Researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined officail applications in use, adn since the design is already active domestically a new complet risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design.  Specific components within the infrasturcutre were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requireemnts, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems adn overall performance.  As this is a brand name only justifications, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as teh basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requiremnts as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

TIME REMAINS UNCHANGED AT 3:30P.M. *****************************************************************************                 ANNOUNCEMENT/SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR)                     ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES                                DTFAAC-07-R-03461 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition Engineering and Technical Support Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The contractor shall provide the personnel, materials, resources, and associated management services necessary to perform the work as defined in the Performance Work Statement.  The current version of the PWS, dated June 14, 2007, is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request (SIR) 1.     The contract will be for a 1-year base period with four 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  The contract type will be an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with time-and-material and labor-hour provisions.  The Government estimates the total cost for the 5-year period to be approximately $9,050,600. This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs), that are expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  To be considered the vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment - $25/million).   Should an 8(a) vendor intend to incorporate a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" shall apply to the prime contractor. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in Acquisition Management System Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation of Subcontracting. This acquisition contemplates a phase approach. This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies that are certified under the 8(a) program with SBA an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Announcement/SIR1. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Announcement/SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 20 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  8(a) Certification and Business Declaration Form: 	(a) Provide certification letter from SBA documenting vendor's enrollment in the SBA's 8(a) program and classification as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 541330, Engineering Services. 	(b) Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form. 2.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing engineering and technical support services as identified in the attached PWS.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 3.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate the capability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 	(a) Vendors must demonstrate that a Contract/Technical Manager will be available at the time of contract award.  Qualifications of the Technical Manager are identified in PWS, paragraph 3.3, Position Requirements and Qualifications.  The documentation describing the individual's qualifications may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  It should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), and educational/training background in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence.  In addition, the vendors shall specify a "good faith effort" that the Technical Manager will remain in their respective position for a minimum of one (1) year. 	(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 25 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and the contracts on which they performed or a signed certified list of employees with date of employment including employees managers and the manager's qualification. A copy of the current contract (DTFA-02-02-D-14709), can be downloaded from the AMQ Internet at http://amq.mmac.faa.gov/FOIA.asp  Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Announcement/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to:  Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Joy Dickson Room 313, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK  73125-4933 Note: For overnight mail the ZIP code is 73169 The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:30 p.m. local time, August 29, 2007, (facsimile and e:mail responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. Because all incoming mail and other parcels, including overnight air deliveries, are being pre-screened, before being delivered, vendors are encouraged to submit responses early. AMS Clause, 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting, AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, and AMS Provision 3.9.1-3, PROTEST, are applicable to this SIR1.   Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make the full text available, or offerors and contractors may obtain the full text via Internet at: http://conwrite.faa.gov (on this web page, select "Search and View Clauses").

<DESC>Amendment 01: Statement of Work (SOW) not attached to original Solicitation. 

All other information remains the same. 


Expert services are required to support the National Library of Medicine's mandate to provide bibliographic control of all English language biomedical serials procured for the NLM, to announce these publications to the worldwide biomedical community and to assist biomedical libraries in the bibliographic control of their serial acquisitions by providing cataloging copy.

The National Library of Medicine has an arrearage of over 1,200 titles in the English language which the Cataloging Section is mandated to begin to eliminate during the next fiscal year.  NLM requires assistance in cataloging these serials since it does not have the necessary resources to catalog them.

In order to bring the backlog of over 1,200 uncataloged English language serials under control, NLM requires assistance in cataloging between 125-200 serial titles in these languages. NLM anticipates that (a) approximately 50-80 items will constitute new serial titles cataloged; and (b) approximately 75-120 items will be titles completed from records identified in the OCLC WorldCAT. 

The project entails: 1) searching titles in the OCLC WorldCAT, an outside bibliographic source, to identify and download any matching serial bibliographic records available into NLM?s Voyager catalog; 2) verifying/correcting bibliographic data,  including name and series access points, on existing bibliographic records in accordance with Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition, rev. 1998 (AACR2R) rules, the Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRIs), the CONSER Standard Record Guidelines (CSR), and NLM Instructions for Serials Cataloging, in the Voyager and OCLC databases; 3) adding appropriate NLM subject headings (MeSH) and classification numbers as needed to the record in Voyager and OCLC; and 4) tagging the identified OCLC records found with NLM?s special holdings symbol, adding NLM?s unique control numbers, title abbreviations, and indexing information as needed.

See Statement of Work for details of requirements.

<DESC>TEMPORARY DESALINATION PLANT, FULLY OPERATED, FOR PRODUCTION OF 450,000 GALLONS OF POTABLE WATER AT THE USCG LORAN STATION AT PORT CLARENCE, ALASKA.  The U.S. Coast Guard is surveying the market for interest and availability, and possible options in regards to the following requirement:  The USCG LORAN Station at Port Clarence, Alaska is in need of a temporary desalination plant onsite and operationally capable of producing 450,000 gallons of potable water in no more than a 60-day treatment period starting no later than July 1, 2005.  The total dissolved solids in the seawater is 31,700 mg/L.  Pre-treatment of the water prior to contact with reverse osmosis membranes may be required due to concerns related to biological fouling.  The Coast Guard has received information that a Reverse Osmosis plant on Little Diomede Island, near Port Clarence, has had a problem with biological fouling of membranes.  The portable plant must be delivered to Kodiak, Alaska where it will then be transported to Port Clarence via C-130 aircraft.  Thus, the plant must be capable of breaking down into components which can be loaded inside a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft for transport - the C-130 cargo hold is 41 feet long by 8.75 feet wide by 8.75 feet tall - the contractor must allow for crating, palletizing and loading clearances to fit the plant within the available cargo hold space.  The C-130 maximum payload is 32,623 lbs and the maximum load per axle is 12,500 lbs.  Treatment plant must be fully self-contained with all necessary equipment, filtration, pumps, water hose, power generation, and manpower to successfully operate.  Existing Facilities Information: The remote U.S. Coast Guard facility is located near Point Spencer, Northwest of Nome, Alaska.  The station has access by air or water only. There is no road access.  Existing water storage tank capacity on site is 450,000 gallons.  Facility and water storage tanks are approximately 2,000 feet from the ocean beach.  The station will have depleted its potable water supply by early August 2005.  Production of potable water must begin prior to depletion of the existing supply.  The total production of 450,000 gallons must be completed by September, before onset of winter.  The station has chlorination equipment on site for chlorination of product water prior to use by station personnel.  Wastewater from the water treatment plant shall be discharged into the ocean.  The CG will provide food and lodging on site for water treatment operating personnel. There will be a charge of approximately $15 per person per day for meals.  Supplemental Information:  Bering Sea water from the bay will be the raw water supply.  Saltwater temperatures are expected to be between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.  Potable water output shall meet State of Alaska potable water quality standards.  The U.S. Coast Guard, in conjunction with the contractor, will work with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) to get the necessary permits.  Information Requested:  Interested vendors are asked to provide information regarding company background relating to similar projects/services; type of water treatment system that would be proposed based on the expected water quality, and water temperature information provided by the Government; capabilities and output of proposed water treatment plant; ability to meet the required timeline; system set-up information such as water intake, wastewater discharge, piping/pump systems to pump water to the storage tanks; and information regarding personnel who would operate the plant.  Provide information via fax, email or mail to Ron Klaudt, USCG Civil Engineering Unit, P.O. Box 21747, Juneau, AK 99802-1747.  Technical questions should be addressed to Kevin Darvell, phone (907) 463-2406, fax 463-2404; email kdarvell@cgalaska.uscg.mil.

I.	BACKGROUND AND NEED 

Since the 1950s, researchers have been concerned about the effect media violence has on youth behavior and development.  A 1972 US Surgeon Generals report voiced this concern to the scientific community.  The 1980s and 1990s were marked with laboratory and field experiments attempting to parse out the role movies, television, and video games played in aggressive attitudes and behaviors.  Findings contributed to the 2002 US Surgeon General report on Youth Violence.   Today, there is general agreement in the scientific community that viewing violence, at least for some children, increases aggressive attitudes, values, and behaviors.  Even with this prolific research activity, gaps in our understanding of the relationship between media violence and aggressive behavior remain.  First, despite substantial evidence of short-term effects of media violence on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, little research has considered the link with seriously violent or criminal behavior.  Second, effects of media violence on aggressive behavior seem to be particularly pronounced for younger children; little research has considered the link for older children and adolescents. Third, with increased use of the Internet among young people, little is known about how exposure to violence on the Internet fit into our growing understanding of the effect of violent mediums.  The Internet is fast becoming the telephone of the 21st century, with an estimated 97% of young people between the ages of 12 and 18 using online communication.  Because almost all youth are now online, this access may have increased opportunities for children and youth to be exposed to violence.  Websites such as hate pages that encourage discrimination of specific types of people, and those reporting real violence such as news websites have the potential to reinforce cognitive styles and orientations that support aggressive responding, thereby increasing the perpetration of seriously violent behavior.

II.  	PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze data related to youth 10-15 exposed to media violence that will support and further the understanding of the co-occurrence of exposure to media violence and engaging in serious criminal and/or aggressive behavior.   In addition to supporting the general management of this project (e.g., data cleaning, preparing data files, generating basic reports), the contractor will support conducting extensive and complex analyses on the longitudinal data (from years 1 and 2).  

III. 	SCOPE OF WORK
The contractor will be responsible for media violence exposure data collection, statistical analyses and dissemination of findings from Media Violence data.  

IV.  	TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
1: Clean and analyze Year 2 media violence data.
2: Management and oversight of Year 3 Media Violence data collection

V. 	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE September 30, 2007 to September 29, 2008

VI. 	DELIVERABLES 

	1: Media violence exposure data file for Year 2 of data collection by 1/31/08.
	2: Summary report of Year 2 media violence exposure data by 4/30/08.
3: Raw data file of Year 3 data by 9/30/08.

<DESC>The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) on behalf of the United States Attorney?s Office District of New Jersey invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Guard Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by September 14, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. (EST).  This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on key personnel, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. The Proposals shall include the following information:

(1) Provide resumes of prospective personnel. The personnel will be the person expected to perform the tasks identified in the Scope of Work. The resume should reflect the personnel?s security clearance level, training and certifications, if any.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor?s experience demonstrating the contractor?s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.


This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 561612.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.  

The Government estimated value of this contract is $400,000.00 for one base year and four 12 month option years.  The precise period of performance will be determined at the time of award.

Thus, the plant must be capable of breaking down into components which can be loaded inside a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft for transport - the C-130 cargo hold is 41 ft long by 8.75 ft wide by 8.75 feet tall - the contractor must allow for crating, palletizing and loading clearances to fit the plant within the available cargo hold space.  The C-130 maximum payload is 32,623 lbs and the maximum load per axle is 12,500 lbs.  Treatment plant must be fully self-contained with all necessary equipment, filtration, pumps, water hose, power generation, and manpower to successfully operate.  Existing Facilities Information: The remote U.S. Coast Guard facility is located near Point Spencer, Northwest of Nome, Alaska.  The station has access by air or water only. There is no road access.  Existing water storage tank capacity on site is 450,000 gallons.  Facility and water storage tanks are approximately 2,000 feet from the ocean beach.  The station will have depleted its potable water supply by early August 2005.  Production of potable water must begin prior to depletion of the existing supply.  The total production of 450,000 gallons must be completed by September, before onset of winter.  The station has chlorination equipment on site for chlorination of product water prior to use by station personnel.  Wastewater from the water treatment plant shall be discharged into the ocean.  The CG will provide food and lodging on site for water treatment operating personnel. There will be a charge of approximately $15 per person per day for meals.  Supplemental Information:  Bering Sea water from the bay will be the raw water supply.  Salt-water temperatures are expected to be between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.  Potable water output shall meet State of Alaska potable water quality standards.  The U.S. Coast Guard, in conjunction with the contractor, will work with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) to get the necessary permits.  Information Requested:  Interested vendors are asked to provide information regarding company background relating to similar projects/services; type of water treatment system that would be proposed based on the expected water quality, and water temperature information provided by the Government; capabilities and output of proposed water treatment plant; ability to meet the required timeline; system set-up information such as water intake, wastewater discharge, piping/pump systems to pump water to the storage tanks; and information regarding personnel who would operate the plant.

<DESC>This is a request for information/sources sought notice(RFI) to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) for the purpose of conducting Market Research only.  At this time, no solicitation is currently available, a procurement is not planned and unsolicited proposals in responses to this RFI will not be accepted.  The NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland is conducting market research to determine the extent to which businesses/organizations are capable of providing the herein described synchrotron ultraviolet radiation facility services.  The NAICS code for which a contractor may respond to this RFI is 541710 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The third-generation Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) located at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD requires services to upgrade the existing facility in order to better support the needs of its industrial user base. In recent years, much attention has been paid to the advantages of low energy synchrotrons for applications such as next-generation Extreme-Ultra-Violet (EUV) lithographic mirror testing, EUV mirror damage studies, calibration of photo-diodes for industrial purposes, and the calibration and testing of NASA satellites. Because world-wide industrial demand for stable, calibrated, synchrotron light sources has been growing at an unprecedented pace, many new facilities are currently being developed around the world to address the surge in industrial demand. In order to remain at the forefront of this very important area of active research, and to be able to compete with growing number of international facilities, the NIST SURF III facility must be upgraded. The proposed synchrotron upgrades will improve NIST?s ability to serve the needs of the EUV industrial community, as well as benefiting other important research activities at SURF III such as UV Fourier transform spectroscopy, absolute cryogenic radiometry, and standard light source development.
The capabilities requested of potential sources in this RFI are as follows:
1)The cavity-tune control system for the high-power, 114 megahertz (MHz) radio frequency (rf) cavity that supplies the energy electrons lose due to synchrotron radiation, needs to be upgraded. At present the cavity is tuned by a metallic plunger which is controlled by a reversible motor. The phase of the reflected power from the cavity is monitored and used to control circuitry that drives the motor. However, under a variety of beam conditions there is significant chatter in the motor drive due to electron-beam instabilities that change the coupling to the rf cavity. NIST is interested in information/sources regarding designing a new cavity-tune system that remains chatter-free even under unstable beam conditions. The new system should include a stepper motor as the principle drive to increase the flexibility of the system.
2)Demand for using the Synchroton requires overnight use by researchers Unfortunately, the control system and the primary power systems (i.e., 250 kW magnet supply, 30 kilowatt (kW) rf transmitter, etc.) were not designed to be impervious to transients in the primary alternate current (AC) power grid (three-phase 480 volts alternate current (VAC), three-phase 208 VAC, and single-phase 120 VAC), and transients as short as 50 milliseconds (ms) in duration cause complete beam loss. Consequently, NIST is interested in information/sources that entail a detailed examination of the control system, so that loss of beam when transients are present on the AC grid, are minimized through control-system modifications. 
4)NIST is interested in information/sources for upgrading the Synchrotron VME-based control system to one that interfaces to the actual machine through more autonomous tributary controls.
5)An infrared microscopy beam line at the SURF III facility has low beam currents and instabilities in the electron beam seriously impacted the usefulness of the setup.  Since infrared microscopy is a very useful technique for forensic analysis, NIST would like to explore the possibility of improving electron beam currents and stability to the point where the technique becomes viable.  To that end, NIST is interested in information/sources for investigating new techniques to improve electron beam currents such as adiabatic rf electron capture during injection.  
6)The distributed ion pumps in the storage ring vacuum chamber at the SUF III facility exhibit instabilities that sometimes result in partial or complete beam loss.  Since these ion pumps are integral to the welded vacuum can, they cannot be easily repaired or replaced. If replacement were necessary, the NIST facility would have to shut down for at least a year to perform these repairs.  Obviously, this would have a serious, negative impact on industrial users who rely on the SURF III facility for calibration purposes as well as next-generation lithographic mirror testing.  Therefore, NIST is interested in information/sources to determine the potential causes of the ion-pump instabilities and determine the operational parameters for the distributed pumping system that minimize these instabilities.  
7)Significant levels of radiation are a safety concern at the SURF III facility.  Minimizing safety hazards is a high priority for NIST personnel.  To end, NIST is interested in information/sources for a network of detectors for gamma rays and neutrons.  The detectors must be able to operate continuously.  The information provided by the remote radiation detectors shall be used to control audible alarms to warn personnel present in the SURF III facility of a radiation danger.  
8)In particular, the ramp rate of the high-current, high-voltage supply (1250 Amps at 200 volts direct current [VDC]) is not a dynamically adjustable quantity during the electron-injection phase.  Consequently, , and as such it is not possible to optimize the Synchrotron system.  In the initial phase of the injection, the background gas collisional cross section for scattering electrons out of orbit is high, and this would seem to indicate that it is best to initially ramp the electron energy quickly.  However, at this stage of injection the index is highly variable, because of Eddy-currents in the magnet as the field changes (a consequence of the weak-focusing condition), and this means that fast changes in electron energy cause electron loss.  NIST is interested in information/sources for optimizing the Synchrotron system.
9)Beam injection into the primary storage ring at the SURF III facility is accomplished using two kicker magnets after the electrons are accelerated to 10 MeV by a race-track Microtron and focused into the ring using a combination of deflection/focusing optics. The first kicker magnet (inflector) is a single-turn coil through which 10,000 amp pulse of current passes. Ideally, the current-pulse duration would be reduced to the 20 microsecond (?s) level because it presents a destructive perturbation to the electrons once they are captured into the ring. Unfortunately, the present system suffers from after pulsing if the pulse duration is less than 100 ?s.  NIST is interested in information/sources for ascertaining the reason for this after-pulsing, and technical approach for solving this problem.
10)The energy radiated from SURF III via synchrotron radiation exceeds the original design targets by over two orders of magnitude, and this has already resulted in two vacuum breeches due to thermally-induced window damage. To complicate matters there are internal structures (plates, kicker magnets, etc.) weakly coupled to the ambient thermal reservoir that are highly susceptible to thermal damage. NIST is interested in information/sources on how to better identify which structures are at risk from thermal damage as well as technical approach to reduce thermal damage.
11)Optimization of the current injected into the SURF III storage ring at 10 MeV before ramping the energy is a very challenging problem, because the characteristic wavelength of synchrotron emission is greater than 20 microns (?m) at 10 MeV.  Therefore, no visible light is available to be used as a measure of the stored current. At present, the SURF III storage ring monitors the beam current using a section of S-band waveguide. As the electron bunches pass through this waveguide an image charge of opposite sign is induced in the waveguide.  The charge passes through a 50 Ohm resistor on its way to the waveguide, inducing a voltage that can be used as a measure of the current in the ring.  Unfortunately, the electron bunch is longer than the waveguide, and therefore some electrons in the bunch are leaving as others enter, making the induced voltage a poor measure of the stored current since the induced charge on the monitor waveguide doesn?t change. To make matters worse, the bunch length fluctuates in time as the injection parameters are changed. NIST is interested in information/sources to determine the stored charge in the ring at 10 MeV that does not involve using the previously mentioned S-band waveguide. The new method should not be sensitive to electron-bunch length, or electron-bunch shape, and will produce a signal that can be used to optimize the stored current before ramping the energy, thereby leading to higher operational currents.  The time constant for any control electronics must be less than 50 ms so that injection parameters can be optimized in real time during the electron-beam injection phase.
12)The electron beam current stored in the SURF III synchrotron needs to be measured with great precision in order to accurately determine the synchrotron radiation intensity at any given wavelength. Calibration of this stored current is done at the single electron level, and monitoring is performed with hundreds of milliamperes stored in the ring. Therefore the detector must have a large dynamic range (encompassing 11 orders of magnitude in detection sensitivity) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. NIST is interested in information/sources for state-of-the-art, low noise electronics to determine which components should be used in the construction of such a detector.

<DESC>PURCHASE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT: Under authority 41 U.S.C. 253&#169;(1), the Government anticipates entering into a sole source procurement to purchase a Cytyc ThinPrep 2000 Cytology Specimen Processor for the NF/SG VHS in Gainesville, FL, to include the equipment, installation, and training at manufacturer's site for one pathologist and one cytotechnologist.   NAICS code 334516 applies to this procurement.  This contract action is for equipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1 (b) (4) only one responsible source and no other equipment or training will satisfy agency requirements. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquistion Procedures of FAR Part 13 in accordance with the Commercial Item Acquisition Format of FAR Part 12. Interested parties will be considered if the response includes a clear understanding that their submission has the identical capabilities of the Cytyc ThinPrep 2000 Processor, i.e., uses an automated vacuum process rather than a gravity system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received on or before September 4, 2007, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No telephone requests will be accepted. View VA solicitations and contract actions via FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/index.html. Any amendments issued to this solicitation will also be available at the URL address. Offerors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining amendments.

<DESC>3.0	Description 3.1	Purpose: This is a reissuance of RFI W81XWH-07-RFI-ITS, posted May 14, 2007 to provide a more granular description of a typical MHS system from which to base responses. The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to identify interested and available vendor s capable of providing centralized computer systems management hosting, sustainment support, and network infrastructure support.  The RFI is also intended to solicit vendor information about their capabilities to include associated personnel.  This RFI out lines the Military Health Systems (MHS) requirements for hosting as well as service levels which must be met to provide the high quality of service (QoS) in availability/reliability required of Military Health System (MHS) critical applications.   This is an RFI from the Tri-Service Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO).  TIMPO does not intend to grant any type of award instrument based on vendor responses, or otherwise provide compensation for the information solicited.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI is provided voluntarily.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), or as an obligation or co mmitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Respondents are advised that TIMPO is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted  under this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED UNDER THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SYNOPSIS.  No reimbursement will be made for any c osts associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  Responses to this notice are not offers; will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract; and will not be returned. This Notic e shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Should a requirement arise, the full description will be detailed in the resulting solicitation. Questions concerning the requirements for a future solicitation will not be entertained. This RFI is open to any capable and qualified sources, including, but not limited to, government, private or public companies.  3.2	Background: For several years, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has been utilized as a system hosting provider for the MHS, currently hosting well over 15 of our most critical clinical and resource applications. As the Department of Defense (DoD), and mor e importantly the MHS, puts more emphasis on web based or web enabled applications we foresee our hosting requirements increasing and so we are faced with the very real issue of cost versus business continuity. In an effort to determine the best way forwar d, the MHS is in the process of developing a business case analysis (BCA) designed to explore the potential benefits and challenges of hosting outside of the MHSs traditional hosting provider from both a fiscal concern as well as a business/functional/ope rational concern. This RFI is one stage in the development of that BCA and is designed to provide industry an opportunity to suggest industry best practice and industry standard level of effort to host and administer healthcare applications which are criti cal to the quality of care being provided to military beneficiaries now and into the future. While this RFI defines an architecture typical to the MHS primary clinical application, it is hoped the information gleaned from responses to this RFI can be extr apolated and applied over the greater whole of all MHS applications and systems. It is the hope of the MHS that industry will respond to the architecture as suggested herein and l ikewise encourages industry to suggest alternate architectures capable of maintaining a minimum 99.5% availability. 3.3	Objectives: TIMPO requests this information from vendors to aid in the development of a BCA for evaluation of viable hosting service alternatives.  Information provided should include your companys experience relative to the outlined requirements and any additional c apabilities you would suggest.   3.4	Minimum Technical Support Requirements: 3.4.1	Responders should provide a brief high-level description of their organization.  Responses should contain relevant example(s) of current or recent projects which clearly demonstrate your experience and performance. 3.4.2	Respondents should describe their ability to support a primary computing facility (PCF) location within the continental United States (CONUS), and an Alternate Computing Facility (ACF), mirroring the physical setup of the primary facility.  The ACF m ust, at a minimum, be 800  1000 miles away from the primary facility, capable of remote operation, and provide high-speed replication of data between the primary and alternate site, and receiving updates from the PCF in real time increments.  Management o f the 101 local cache servers and storage attached networks (SANs) housed at local Military Treatment Facilities worldwide is a secondary requirement for the MHS. 3.4.3	Primary and alternate computing facilities must be capable of maintaining the requirements as specified in Attachment 1, via web link, below.   http://mx.ha.osd.mil/pickup.aspx?id=79440eb5-4b90-408c-a835-23a4de305644	 3.4.4	Respondents should address their experience and documented performance in supporting and maintaining the SLA performance requirements and additional capabilities as specified in Attachment 2, via web link below: http://mx.ha.osd.mil/pickup.aspx?id=556f21b4-0c86-4227-8744-4820cf8f69b0	 3.4.5	Respondents should provide a description and quantity of full time equivalents (FTEs) necessary to support a 24x7 operation, by seniority and necessary skill sets, as they correspond to the above mandatory SLA performance and associated hardware requ irements. 4.0	Instructions to Responders:  Responders should provide technical, business, and administrative points of contact, to include name, address, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses.  Responses to this RFI will be unclassified and identified and marked with the RFI number (BCA-2007-C RM) in the email title or document title, as appropriate.  Responses should arrive at TIMPO no later than fifteen business days from the date of posting.  Responses to this RFI should not to exceed 50 pages.  Emailed responses should be no larger than 10mb, including any appendices and attachments.  Any soft copy responses that exceed 10mb may be provided via CD.  Please do not send standard company brochures or marketing information. All questions relating to this RFI should be sent electronically to (Phillip.LaJoie@tma.osd.mil).  Responses to questions will be provided in a reasonable timeframe.  Please provide a detailed reply to this RFI to include: one (1) electronic copy and one ( 1) hardcopy of your response.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of the Intellitactics Network SecurityManager (NSN) software licenses for maintenance and support. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Immix Technology , Inc, 8444 West Park Dr., McLean, VA 22102.. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967,  Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday, 07 September, 2007; 4:00 p.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The Intellitactics Network Security Manager (NSM) standard maintenance and support is developed by and owned by Intellitactics. Intellitactics utilizes only one distributor to sell its product. That distributor is Immix Technology.  USSOCOM requires Intellitactics Network Security Manager (NSM) support to keep its current NSM system operational and current to protect USSOCOM networks against cyber attack.  Intellitactics has been at the headquarters and all subordinate component commands and is familiar with the USSOCOM enterprise architecture. As the sole Intellitactics distributor, Immix Technology is the only company  who can provide expert technical advice and support for this software. Without this service, USSOCOM will not be able to effectively monitor its networks, against cyber attacks, that are being used to support the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  

To purchase comparable software from any source other than Intellitactics would result in the expenditure of more than $2 million that has already been invested in Intellitactics. These costs, outlined below, include travel, labor and training and amount to approximately $2,081,640.00. These costs are necessary in order to test, integrate and install Intellitactics, as well as gain a level of operational acceptance by the Government for contractors and Government employees. In summary, to purchase comparable software from another vendor would result in substantial duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation will be evaluated and awarded per the prescribed procedures of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation number for this procurement is FA4803-07-Q-A248 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-19, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 2070828 and Air Force Acquisition Circular (AFAC) 2007-0823.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing.  This acquisition is for full and open competition.  This is firm-fixed price procurement and will be procured using commercial item procedures and award selection will be made based on best overall value.   

This requirement is ?Brand Name? for : Med-Eng Systems EOD-9 bomb suits and equipment, see ?brand name? justification documentation below.  

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SOL NR: FA4803-07-QA248
 
I.  Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:  HQ USCENTAF/A7-CE and 20th Contracting Squadron, Shaw AFB, SC 29152-2610.  

II. Nature and/or Description of Action:  A firm fixed price Purchase Order issued to purchase 44 protective bomb suits in support of operations within HQ USCENTAF?s Area of Responsibility (AOR).      

III. Description of Supplies/Services:  This purchase is to include forty four Med Eng Systems EOD-9 bomb suits and equipment.  The order will consist of the following: forty one helmet?s, forty one visor kit?s / breathing apparatus, one small explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) suit, twenty three medium EOD suits, twenty large EOD suits, forty eight hand protectors with gloves, three suit spare part kit?s, three helmet spare part kit?s.

IV. Identification of Statutory Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c), ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.?  

V.  Applicability of Authority:  Med-Eng Systems Inc. is the sole manufacture of the EOD-9 bomb suit which is the only EOD bomb suit approved for use by the United States Air Force.  Med-Eng Systems currently provides Explosive Ordinance Disposal protective suits and equipment to the United States Air Force (USAF) as well as other Department of Defense components.  This equipment will be deployed to the Southwest Asia (SWA) Area of Responsibility (AOR).  As required in FAR 6.302-1(c), the agency head has determined that the acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  Therefore, the nature of this acquisition is authorized IAW FAR 6.302-1(c). 

VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This requirement will be solicited as a brand name requirement and posted on federal Business Opportunity for competition.

VII. Market Research:  Market research was conducted using the SBA Pro Net Search.  Of the 290 contractors under NAICS code 339113 Med Eng Systems is the only authorized manufacture of the EOD 9 ensemble.

VIII.  Other facts supporting other than full and open competition:  As stated in paragraphs V, VI, and VII above, no other manufactures are able to provide the EOD 9 ensemble.  The use of the EOD 9 ensemble saves Airmen?s lives on a daily basis and is crucial for EOD teams to be successful in the Counter (IED) Improvised Explosive Device effort.  Without these capabilities, the security and safety of deployed USCENTAF and Coalition Forces personnel will be severely degraded.  This will certainly result in undue risk accepted to accomplish an already hazardous mission.  On average, each EOD team that is outfitted with the EOD 9 suit performs 1.5 missions per day ?Outside-the-Wire.?  The EOD 9 ensemble is the last line of defense against a determined insurgency that is targeting EOD Airmen.  

IX.  Listing of Sources:  Med-Eng Systems is a small business manufacturer:

Med-Eng Systems Inc.
835 Commerce Park Drive
            Ogdensburg, NY 13669-2209

X.  Statement of the Actions to Remove Competitive Barriers.  At this time there are no actions in progress to remove the competitive barriers on subsequent acquisitions.   No other source is known to manufacturer EOD protective equipment that meets Air Force Standards.  However, we will continue to research for such sources.

XI.  Contracting Officer?s Certification:   ?I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete.? 

XII. Technical/Requirements Certification.  The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified as complete and accurate by the appropriate management level of the technical/requirements organization.

This requirement will  include: Item 0001 - 41 ea EOD 9A Helmet Desert Tan Drab, Part # MA005054-03, Item 0002 - 41 ea EOD 9 BA Visor Kit, part # MA005130, Item 0003 - 1 ea Suit EOD 9 Desert Tan Small, Part # 4000-0091-5, Item 0004 ? 23 ea Suit EOD 9 Desert Tan  Medium, Part # 4000-0091-7, Item 0005 ? 20 ea Suit EOD 9 Desert Tan Large, Part # 4000-0091-8, Item 0006 ? 48 ea Hand Protectors With Gloves MD (9) Pair, Part # 910-021, Item 0007 ? 3 ea EOD 9 Suit Spare Part Kit, Item 0008 ? 3 ea EOD 9A Helmet Spare Part Kit.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

(i) warrants;

(ii) options;

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

(v) others similar interests.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested by this notice alone, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

This synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations for Hotel Guest Rooms accommodation to facilitate incoming National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) personnel to participate in four separate weekly Exchange Programs with the first attendants arriving on September 3, 2007, and the last Program ending date is September 27, 2007. 

1.0     DESCRIPTION

The National Labor Relations Board has a requirement for the following guest rooms accommodation and related services for the Supervisor/Managers/Instructor/Professional Exchange Program, to be held from September 3, 2007 through September 27, 2007, for a combined total of nineteen (19) personnel over the course of four weeks.  

2.0     LOCATION 

The Hotel shall be located within a two blocks radius to the NLRB Headquarters Office, located at 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC  20005, and within walking distance of a wide variety of restaurants, sightseeing opportunities, etc., as the personnel participating in the programs will generally not have rental cars.  Hotel location, accommodations, and amenities will be a dominant factor in the award selection.

3.0     LODGING

The contractor shall provide the following standard guest rooms, space, and services for the NLRB participants.  The standard room rate charged by the Hotel shall be at or below the Maximum Lodging Allowance specified by the U.S. Government's Travel Regulations for per diem in the Washington, DC area.     Current U.S. Government per diem rates can be found under Travel Resources at the following Internet address: http://www.gsa.gov

3.1.     The Hotel shall provide approximately 19 standard guest rooms, bed and room sizes may vary.  Program participants will generally be checking in on Monday, September 3, 2007 and checking out on Friday, September 28, 2007.     A late check out time is desirable for Program participants that will be checking out on Friday, September 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th, 2007.     A final rooming list will be provided to the Hotel selected for the award no later than 5:00 pm eastern standard time on Friday, August 30, 2007; however, participant substitutions will be permissible up to the seminar start date of September 3, 2007.     Individual miscellaneous expenses (i.e., mini-bar, laundry, room service, internet fees, movies, etc.) will be the responsibility of each participant.     Each participant will provide their own credit cards, or method of payment at check-in to cover miscellaneous expenses charged to their rooms.         

3.2.     Guest rooms shall be made available to NLRB participants at the contracted room rate (at or below U.S. Government per diem) at least one day prior to the general check-in date.  Participants checking in prior to September 3, 2007, or staying later than the check out date of September 28, 2007, will be responsible for payment of any additional room nights, unless the hotel is notified in advance that the Government will be covering the cost of the additional stay under the purchase order.

3.3.     Quotations are to include the hotel pricing policy for extra adults and/or children sharing the same room.     Any expenses for additional adults and/or children above the contracted room rate will be the responsibility of each attendee.     Individual participants will provide their own credit cards or method of payment at check-in to cover additional charges (if applicable) for extra adults and/or children.

4.0     EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS

4.1.     Quotations will be evaluated based on which Hotel offers the Best Value to the NLRB, considering both technical factors and price.   All factors other than cost or price, when combinted are significantly more important than cost or price.
The primary technical considerations will be whether the rooms, services, and equipment meet the stated requirements and are suitable for the intended purpose.     This includes the Hotel location, accommodation, and amenities, which will be a dominant factor in award selection as stated in Section 2.0.     Generally, technical considerations will be slightly more important overall than price.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION ? COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have satisfactory or neutral (in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for who information on past performance is not available) past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quotation has been determined acceptable ?g? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation, and who has either been found to have a satisfactory past performance history, no relevant past performance history, or for whom no past performance information is available, will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.

1.  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the stationary pallet inverter with dual arm movement in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	 A list of any ?significant problems? encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer?s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is September 11, 2007 ? 2:00PM local time.

<CONTACT>JEFF VALENTINE, 502-607-1522
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Statement of Work Vehicle will be availbe for inspection the first week of September 2007.  Time must be scheduled in advance with SSG Jeff Valentine 502-607-1522 jeffery.t.valentine@us.army.mil This project consists of two major parts: the camera mast install and the emergency lighting installation.  This equipment will be installed on our National Guard Mobile Command Vehicle (NGMCV). The NGMCV has been in operation for more than a year and requ ires these new upgrades to support our mission requirements.  Camera Mast The mast will be installed on the back right side of the vehicle and mounted to get the maximum height in the raised position and not go over the height restrictions in the lowered position. This will require mounting not on the bumper but on the back exte rior wall. Contractor must insure proper installation for weight loading to avoided damage to vehicle and or mast.  No visible signs of installation on the interior walls will be accepted. All mounting will stay within the walls and not penetrate through t he interior walls. Care must be taken to not penetrate an area that has wiring which will damage the vehicle. The slide-out is also located in this area. Special care must be taken to not interfere with the operations of the slide-out section. (see picture  B)  A pan and tilt camera will be mounted on top of the mast, this will also need to be under the height restriction when in the lowered position.  Also on top of the camera mast will be a fabricated antenna mount that will support an air to ground antenna. This antenna will have to be on a swivel so it can be lower when not in use to stay within the height restrictions. The antenna will have to be in stalled where it wont interfere with operations and view of the camera when the antenna is in either position. (lowered, raised) A custom fabricated mast cover will be installed around the mast to hide the aluminum body of the mast. (see example picture D) A RF coax line will be run from the interior antenna patch panel to the antenna on top of the camera mast. Also the camera video line will run from the camera to the spare video modulator for viewing on all TV monitors. All cables will run inside the vehic les walls. No wire molding will be accepted. The entry point from the mast will be a water tight seal. No silicone or rubber plug will be accepted, must be a connection device that mates to the Nycoil.  All outside cables will run through Nycoil to enclose  cabling to top of mast.   Camera will be per specs outline below. Camera will be what is called a day night color camera. Color during day light and switches to black and white during low light conditions. With no light the camera will switch to IR mode. Built-in backlight compensa tion should allow for minimum object illumination down to 0.07 lux black and white and 0.00 lux under IR conditions. The pan tilt controller will be mounted in the equipment rack located in the back area of the vehicle.  All camera power transformers will be mounted in the back of the equipment rack to give access for troubleshooting repairs. All wiring will be located within the vehicle walls. All wiring will be installed in non-metallic Carlon Carflex liquid tight condui t. Wiring will be stranded THHN wire AWG 12 minimum. All electrical circuits shall conform to the applicable national electrical code.  A 15 gallon air compressor tank will be installed to increase the air flow for the new mast as well as the other two that are already installed. Space is limited so the compressor will need to be installed under the vehicle in an area that will not interfe re with the operations of t he vehicle in movement. An outside control switch will be installed near the mast for raising and lowering. Air hoses must be routed to the other two masts for operations.  Special care must be taken to not scratch white board walls during installation of equipment and wiring. Reroute Night Scan light control to inside the vehicle. The light control is position on the left rear of the vehicle and must be connected at all times while the light is in the operational mode. This causes a problem for security reasons. Need to reroute  control from this location outside to inside the vehicle on same wall. There is a compartment on the inside wall behind the outside box that will be used for this location.

<DESC>RFP 521-07-015 ? Public Opinion Polls ? USAID/Haiti
Questions and Answers
August 28, 2007


Question 1:  There is no reference to the size of sampling to be taken or a margin of error that is acceptable.  It is necessary to determine the sampling size that is required to accurately meet that percentage.   For example a 5% margin of error would require a sampling size of only 385 respondents out of 8.7 million (the population of Haiti. On the other hand if a 1% margin is required 16,556 persons respondents are required.  As you can see the number of respondents increases exponentially as accuracy is required.  This obviously increases logistical costs, and field time.  Our question is to know either the acceptable margin of error, or the sample size required. 

Answer 1:  The acceptable margin of error is 3%.

Question 2:  There is no mention as to preferred location of study.  With Haiti in such a state of flux pockets of skewed responses are to be expected far out of the range - but still within the national average.  Whereas a national poll may be conducted accurately based on sampling size, and still fall into the accepted margin of error nationwide, it will not identify hot spots, or skewed sites of statistical anomalies.  Our question:  Are there specific cities, or regions that are to be surveyed, or are sites to be polled left to the surveyor to determine? 

Answer 2:  We are interested in reviewing the approach of the offerors on this topic.  Obviously, USAID/Haiti has a particular interest in target geographic areas for our FY2007-2009 Haiti Country Strategy.  We require that the polls be national in scope and statistically-significant with the appropriate required disaggregation, per the Statement of Work (SOW).  Offerors may, however, propose further disaggregation.   

For a copy of the current USAID/Haiti Country Strategy, please go to www.hausaid.info and click on the link ?Mission Documents;? then click on Program Office, and the strategy will be the first document in the list.  

Question 3:  Information gathering can be interpreted in different ways.  Does USAID expect information pertaining to trends to be analyzed and trends identified by the surveyor.    i.e if a trend  in subsequent surveys is found does USAID want the surveyor to simply present statistics?  or to interpret and identify causal factors.  i.e  violent crimes are on a rise - does USAID want us to research and determine if new gang activity is the cause or if it is a seasonal trend that may be linked to the "Full Moon" phenomenon? Where burglaries increase on full moon nights as it is easier for criminals to see in the dark.  Our Question - is interpretation of data collected required?  or  tracking and collecting of data only?  

Answer 3:  Proposals should address data collection, tracking and interpretations/trends analysis.  The latter is particularly important for the deliverables under this contract.
Question 4:  Are participation incentives acceptable?  Routinely a monetary or tangible gift incentive for the participation of the respondents time is helpful to increase the likelihood of response rates.  It has been shown that an incentive increases the response rate and does not adversely affect the accuracy of information being collected.  It has also been shown that incentives actually lower the overall price of a difficult survey in the fact that it increases efficiency 

Answer 4:  No incentives should be offered to respondents. 
Question 5:  Is there a particular format to be used for the proposal?  Are there particular forms that need to be submitted?  Does the proposed pricing need to be presented in a particular survey?  For example, do you need an overall price per survey or does that fee need to be broken down in some way? 

Answer 5:  This will be a Firm Fixed Price Commercial Item Contract with each CLIN priced separately.  Prices shall be total for each CLIN and shall not be broken down in any way.  For proposal format instructions, please refer to Instructions to Offerors and FAR and AIDAR clauses listed in the RFP.

Question 6:  Should the proposal include a proposed local partner (including their fees) to work with to conduct the interviews?  Or would that step come later? 

Answer 6:  Offerors should list any local partners in their proposal; however, all fees and related costs shall be included in the respective CLIN?s total price.

Question 7:  What is the sample size of the surveys you have done to date? 

Answer 7:  Previous USAID/Haiti polls used a sample size of approximately 1,200 respondents, which supported a margin of error of +/- 2.8% and a confidence level of 95%.

Question 8:  Can we get a copy of the most recent survey USAID has done in Haiti?  Can we get a copy of the report from the survey? 

Answer 8:  The successful offeror will have access on an as needed basis.

Question 9:  Would the presentation of the results take place in Haiti or Washington, D.C.? 

Answer 9:  Haiti 

Question 10:  Based on your experience, what have you found to be the biggest challenge in conducting the surveys in Haiti? 

Answer 10:  USAID/Haiti has relied on the expertise of its contractors.

Question 11:  In reviewing the illustrative list of survey questions in the RFP and thinking about how USAID should approach its polling in Haiti in the future, some things come to mind: have you asked questions in the past getting at what media people listen to or watch?  Have you asked what people perceive to be the biggest problems in health and education?  (We have other thoughts, which we will lay out in the proposal, but were curious about these two for now). 

Answer 11:  Per the SOW, final poll questions in each case will be determined collaboratively by USAID/Haiti and the successful offeror.  Additional questions can certainly be proposed. 

Question 12:  Are the previous polling reports available for review?

Answer 12:  Please refer to question and answer No. 8 above.

Question 13:  Is it possible for you to inform us of what the
  previous polling contract was let for?

Answer 13:  Under this RFP, this information will not be made available.

Question 14: What are the expectations of USAID/Haiti regarding data collection methodology?  (Given the difficulties of mail and telephone service in Haiti, our initial thought is that conducting a face to face, community level polling effort would be most appropriate).

Answer 14: Offerors should propose their methodology which will be evaluated. 

Question 15: Does USAID/Haiti have a previously developed opinion of what constitutes a "representative sample" (sample size) of all persons in the country of Haiti?

Answer 15: Please refer to questions and answers Nos. 1 and 2. above.

Question 16: Would it be possible to obtain samples of previous surveys conducted for the Mission?

Answer 16:  Please refer to question and answer No. 8 above

Question 17:  Does the Mission has some guidelines regarding the length and complexity (e.g., number of questions per instrument, time estimated for respondents to answer each survey questionnaire) of the questionnaires being contemplated? 

Answer 17:  USAID/Haiti cannot give a specific time for respondents to be allowed to answer one question, as it depends on the person?s educational level and their knowledge of the subject.  If you ask a Haitian peasant their opinion of World Bank lending policies, it is possible that it will take a while, or they will say that they ?don?t know.?  In other words, USAID/Haiti would like to have interviewers who are trained to adapt to the respondent?s ability to answer the questions, but who are always cognizant of the ?interest drop off? that naturally occurs in every human being after responding to multiple polling questions.

Question 18:  The RFP states that ?Data from these polls must be disaggregated by gender (male/female) and geographic location of the respondents by Department and Commune.  There are 10 Departments and 140 Communes.?

One interpretation of this statement is that very large representative samples must be drawn if statistically significant results for individual Communes are to be presented.

Another possible approach would be to aggregate Communes and/or Departments by some programmatic, geographic or donor determined criteria to derive more manageable and economical sample sizes.

This issue is crucial for planning, timing and costing purposes given the constraints associated with conducting surveys in Haiti. If the latter option is what the Mission has in mind, is a breakdown of the regional aggregates available?

Answer 18:  Same size should support a margin of error of 3%.  See also answer to Question #2 above.

Question 19:  What type of contract is this?  Is this a Firm Fixed Price? A Cost Plus Fixed Price? Etc. 

Answer 19: This will be a Firm Fixed Price Commercial Item Contract

Question 20:  Is this a new contract or a re-compete?  If this is a re-compete, who is the incumbent? 

Answer 20:  This is a recompete; the last contractor was CID GALLUP 

Question 21:  Will the contractor have access to any existing and Government-supplied data, surveys and analyses on public perception in Haiti? 

Answer 21:  See question No. 8.

Question 22:  Is there a target Sample Size already determined for these polls, or is that the responsibility of the contractor?  If so, does the Government require a proposed Sample Size in our competitive bid? 

Answer 22:  Same size sufficient to support a margin of error of 3%. 

Question 23:  Are there any specific requirements for proposal submission other that ?Quality, Past Performance and Price??  In other words, does the Government desire to see separate Proposal volumes such as a technical and management volume? 

Answer 23:  The USG will read all proposals in their entirety.  Offerors should refer to SOW Instructions to Offerors and Questions and Answers (Q&A) for instructions on preparing proposals.

Question 24:  Is there any requirement to analyze collected survey data and integrate predictive modeling?  Or is this initiative to simply collect, organize and present data? 

Answer 24:  Please refer to answer to question No. 3. above.

Question 25:  Is there a requirement for face-to-face surveys or can the requirements of this solicitation be met through telephone interviews or other methods? 

Answer 25:  Proposed polling methodology should be addressed by the offeror in their proposal.

Question 26: Is there a requirement for the utilization of local Haitians to work under this contract? 

Answer 26:  Proposed polling methodology should be addressed by offerors in their proposal.

Question 27:  Are the fieldwork locations already identified or is that the contractor?s responsibility? 

Answer 27:  It is the offerors responsibility to propose.

Question 28:  Should the contractor expect to conduct polls in traditionally non-permissive areas and/or hostile areas? 
Answer 28:  The USAID/Haiti Strategy for FY2007-2009 includes target geographic areas, of which some are considered hotspots.  While there is no requirement to conduct polling in hotspots, offerors who propose including respondents from hotspots in their polls will be demonstrating their understanding of USAID/Haiti?s strategy and their effort to align their technical proposal to USAID/Haiti?s strategic interests.

Question 29:  Other than the gender and geographic location of respondents, are there any other specific characteristics the contractor should disaggregate?  If so, is this the responsibility of the contractor to determine? 

Answer 29:   Refer to answer to question No. 18

Question 30:  In the ?Instructions to Bidders? section, it refers to how the contractor will present information to USAID/Haiti and other interested parties.  Is there a specific number of presentations already determined, and are there any travel requirements associated? 

Answer 30:  This is addressed in the SOW.  

Question 31:  Is there a projected contract budget or Not To Exceed (NTE) proposed cost? 

Answer 31:  No, this will be a Firm Fixed Price contract.  

Question 32:  Is there any specific requirement for the use of programs such as Statistical Predictive Analysis Survey (SPSS)? 

Answer 32:  Offerors should propose a methodology, keeping in mind that USAID/Haiti uses the following: Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, Travel Manager, Office XP Suite

Question 33:  Does the government desire any specific method for organization collected data in a database such as Microsoft Access? 

Answer 33:  Offerors should propose a methodology, keeping in mind that USAID/Haiti uses the following: Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, Travel Manager, Office XP Suite

Question 34:  Which firms and/or individuals are not acceptable to USAID on   this RFP?

Answer 34:  USAID has not determined that any firms and / or individuals are not acceptable.  This statement has been deleted from the RFP and replaced with AIDAR Clause 752-7013 CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS (OCT 1989).  The following statement is added to the proposal guidelines:  Due to the political sensitivity of the survey questions, the proposal must demonstrate the Offerors? ability to contract interviewers who possess the highest ethical and professional standards.  

Question 35:  Do you have a specific proposal format for the above
RFP?

Answer 35:  Please refer to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, including the FAR and AIDAR clauses, and all questions and answers herein.

<DESC>Please see questions and answers listed below.

Question 1a)  What specific functionality does the multiple radio interface unit provide?
     This provides us with the capability to broadcast the message on VHF and UHF radios.

Question 1b)  What does the multiple radio interface unit i)  interface with and ii)  the associated interface requirements?  Mr. Barrow (2-1095) from radio maintenance would know the requirements but it interfaces with our radios that we currently use.

M-Audio Filter

Question 2a)  What specific functionality does the M-Audio Filter provide?  I am only guessing on this but I am sure it has to do with filtering out the background noise while making voice recordings to make it easier for the computer to convert human voice to synthesized voice. 

Question 2b)  What does the M-Audio Filter i)  interface with and ii)  the associated interface requirements? The equipment will interface with ARINC?s main computer system that runs the D-ATIS.

On-Track

Question 3a)  What specific functionality does On-Track provide? I don?t know what this is so you would have to ask ARINC.

Question 3b)  What does the On-Track i)  interface with and ii)  the associated interface requirements?

Microphone

Question 4a)  What does the microphone i)  interface with and ii)  the associated interface requirements?
  The microphone is connected to the voice recorder which is part of the base system in our facility.  

Question 4b)  What needs to be recorded? Our airfield is ever changing and what is in the existing software will need to change with it. This gives us the capability to add information to the existing database within minutes of the change.  Without it we would have to send our updates to ARINC, they would have to develop the software patch, send it to us via mail for installation which would take days if not weeks based on their workload.   


Reference Manuals
24 Hour/7 Days A Week Service Support (1-800 Number)

DATISLINK (Automated Transfer Of D-ATIS Messages To Central D-ATIS Server)

Question 5a)  What is DATISLINK? This is a national server that sends our airport information out on a network to where the aircraft can print out our information versus the pilots having to wait until they get within 100 miles or so and listen to our voice broadcast. 

Question 5bi)  Is there a specific Central D-ATIS Server(s) to which the d-ATIS information must be provided?  If so, please identify. Yes, this system is provided by ARINC and is based out of Scott AFB, IL.

Question 5bii)  Is the Central D-ATIS Server where aircraft ACARS d-ATIS requests for Eglin d-ATIS are to be routed and the source of the corresponding ACARS d-ATIS response to the aircraft? I believe so.

Question 5biii)  What are the interface requirements between the D-ATIS Tower System and the Central D-ATIS Server? I am not sure of this except for needing LAN connection at the speed of 10/100 MBPS..

Question 5c)  What are the connectivity requirements between the D-ATIS Tower System and the Central D-ATIS Server? This is a LAN based system.  We just need 10/100 MBPS connectivity which already exists in the facility.

Question 5d)  Are the connectivity requirements to be covered under separate contract? No, it is in the original contract.

One Year Warranty Including Cold Standby And
2 Voice Library Changes

Question 6)  What is the voice library requirement at the onset? Local area information.  When the team comes down for the site survey they?ll have a list of all of our airfield information and our NOTAMS/Airfield advisories to build into the software.  With the voice recorder, we are able to add new information over time to build into the library.

Recorder Must Meet Minimum Requirements For Connectivity With IDS-5 For Automatic Updates Of METAR Information.

Question 7a)  What are the recording requirements for the d-ATIS Tower System? Each system has a different maximum recording time.  We require a minimum of 30 ? 45 seconds.  If the broadcasts get any longer than that it becomes way to long for the pilot to listen to and fly the plane. I am not sure what the max is but most systems record up to 90 seconds.

Question 7b)  What are the connectivity requirements between the d-ATIS Tower System and the IDS-5? It has to integrate with IDS-5 so it can download the weather data directly into the D-ATIS program to help reduce controller workload.

Question 7c)  What are the interface requirements between the d-ATIS Tower System and the IDS-5?  E.g. what format is the METAR information provided, what other information and format, if any is sent from the IDS-5 to the d-ATIS Tower system, what information and format, if any does the d-ATIS Tower System need to send to the IDS-5?
The IDS-5 and the D-ATIS work in the same format using METARs.  If there is a format or item that the D-ATIS doesn?t recognize, the controller can choose the information needed from a drop down menu. The D-ATIS system actually recognizes AFTN, AWOS/ASOS, and IDS weather updates.  This basically covers every type of format out there.

Question 7d)  Is the d-ATIS Tower System display used for the ATIS controller interface for confirming the ATIS content such that the IDS-5 is not used for the ATIS controller interface?  If not, please clarify.  Yes the D-ATIS is used to confirm the content that is downloaded via IDS-5 prior to broadcasting the message to the pilots.

Must Also Include ACARS Data Link For ATIS Cockpit Display Or Printout.
Question 8i)  Please clarify this requirement relative to what the d-ATIS Tower System must support.  Is the requirement for the d-ATIS Tower System to receive d-ATIS requests sent from flight crews via ACARS and be able to send the corresponding response in ARINC 620 ACARS ground/ground format?  If the Central D-ATIS Server is to provide this functionality, then, it is not clear why the d-ATIS Tower System requires this functionality also.
Question 8ii)  If the d-ATIS Tower System is to provide such ACARS d-ATIS request/response processing, will the connectivity requirements for connecting to ACARS networks be covered under a separate contract?

The D-ATIS system is primarily used to reduce controller workload by downloading weather information from IDS-5, implementing it into the broadcast message in the correct format with all the required airfield information.  Once the download is complete, all the controller has to do is listen to the new message to ensure its correctness and then broadcast the message over our VHF and UHF radios by clicking one button on the screen.  In the past we have had problems with pilots understanding the entire ATIS message because of controllers talking too fast or because of a person?s accent.  The clarity in ARINC?s  synthesized  voice has greatly reduced a pilots need to listen to the broadcast more than once and the complaints have become nil at bases with this system.  The old way took a controller an average of 3 ? 5 minutes to make this broadcast keeping their eyes in the cab environment and off of the airfield.  With the D-ATIS, the controller should only spend approximately 1-2 minutes dealing with the computer and then the rest of the time looking out the window at the airfield.  This doesn?t seem like much but every minute counts when it comes to the safety of the aircraft.  

The ACARS is important for aircraft who have the cockpit capability to download/print out the information prior to their departure.  They can use this information when deciding divert bases or to help pre-plan their approach into the airfield based on the reported weather no matter where they are.  The Air Force is equipping its planes with the ACARS system to help relieve a pilot?s workload in the cockpit by moving in the direction of electronic means versus manual means of obtaining information.

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Questions / Answers

Question:  What is the desired flow rate?  (Typical flow rates are 0.1 CFM, 1.0 CFM, 2.0 CFM, and 50 L/min)
Answer:  3 L/min with a 3" Hg vacuum
*****
Question:  Should the particle counters include a pump, or can they be attached to a separate vacuum source?
Answer:  The OPC should include a pump.
*****
Question:  If they can be attached to a separate vacuum source, do you have a facility vacuum source we can use, or would we need to quote a pump for that also?
Answer:  NA
*****
Question:  If the particle counters should include a pump, do you require that the output of the pump be HEPA filtered?
Answer:  No.
*****
Question:  Would you be interested in a wireless LAN, or do you prefer or require wired LAN connections?
Answer:  Wired LAN connection only.
*****
Question:  Shelter Mounting:  Do you have a requirement or preference for how the shelters are mounted to the ceiling tiles? Can they be mounted with screws, or do you prefer non-penetrating mounting? Can they be mounted with adhesive? Can you tell us the manufacturer and part number of the tiles, or can you send us a mechanical drawing of them?
Answer:  In the past, shelters were screwed into the ceiling tiles.  However, this is not a requirement.  The mounting should be designed in such a way to minimize the sound and the effects of vibration over a long period of time.  Adhesives or non-penetrating methods are as acceptable, provided they follow the other requirements.  The ceiling tile is not specially manufactured.  
*****
Question:  Do you want the power and LAN connections to be made from the top (through the tile) or from the side of the shelter?
Answer:  It is preferable that all power and LAN connections be made from the side of the shelter.  
*****
Question:  Inlet Direction:  Most particle monitoring is done with the sample inlet facing up, not down.  In cases where our customers have the sample inlets facing down, most of them use a "U" shaped sample tube to ensure that the end of the sample tube is facing up.  Do you want the end of the sample tube facing up or down?
Answer:  PFPA requires a straight line without any bends that samples from the building air below the ceiling tile.
*****
Question:  Data Collection Software and Protocol:  Do you plan to collect and display the data with an existing system you already have, or should we quote software to collect and display the data?
Answer: The data stream from the Tier 1 Bio will feed into our existing command and control software.
*****
Question:  Is the system a commercial product or proprietary/custom?
Answer:  The system is proprietary.
*****
Question:  If it's proprietary, what device communication protocols does it support?  
Answer:  The current protocols are typical of those used for many different kinds of sensors, including RS-232, Ethernet, and Parallel Port.  The current prototype uses the Ethernet Port set up as a TCP/IP server.  The typical client/server relationship.  An XML message string is preferred.  The contractor must share the content of the message set, as it is likely the CBRN will need to use the device?s API library for development.  
*****
Question:  Installation Responsibility: Do we need to include installation, or will you install the sensors yourselves?
Answer:  No, installation is not required.
*****
Question:  Under desirable requirements, it asks that the instruments don't require expensive, frequent calibration.  For most of our customers, calibration frequency is usually determined based on industry standards our customers follow.  Which (if any) of the industry cleanroom standards (ISO 14644, Fed Std 209E, etc.) do you follow?  What cleanroom class is your facility (i.e., ISO class 1, 2, 3, etc. or Fed Std 209E class 1, 10, 100, etc.)?
Answer:  These units will be used in the Pentagon ? it does not meet any industry cleanroom standards.  It is analogous to the indoor air of an office building.
*****
Question:  Do you require validation documentation?  (This is typically required in FDA regulated processes such as pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing).
Answer:  Validation of performance is required as part of the Certificate of Analysis that would be delivered with each unit; this level of validation, however, is not comparable to an FDA process.
*****
Question:  Section 2: Sends update of particle counts at a minimum of every six seconds Normally data is collected as a master / slave arrangement with the sensor responding to a command from the computer or PLC.  This helps avoid data loss due to uncontrolled traffic of data when all sensors transmit data at the same time. Please confirm that the sensor will transmit its data upon a command from some external source.
Answer:  Yes. This is correct.  The sensor will transmit its data upon a command from an external source.  
*****
Question:  All particle counter information should be transmitted to one IP address.  In our experience each counter needs to have a unique IP address to enable the user to identify each counter and its location. Please clarify if each sensor should have a unique IP address or if the intention is to have one IP address for all 100 sensors.
Answer:  Each sensor will have it's own unique IP Address.

<DESC>Clarification for VA528-07-RQ-0201, 700Kw Rental Generator, Albany VA Medical Center I would like to clarify in detail the scope of work for the rental generator, I think this will clarify any confusion and be sufficient enough to submit a proposal. The requirements are for a rental generator to provide emergency power in the event of a normal power failure.  The rental generator must be large enough to provide emergency power for the connected load; monthly test results yield a minimum of 250 amp 480 volt load, however this main generator must be capable of handling (back-feeding) other generators on the emergency power grid, which could be in excess of 600 amps at any given time if the other generators fail. The rental generator contract must also include a 1 time yearly load bank test to ensure that wet-stacking will not occur.   &quot;	Note:  The existing rental 700kw (kilowatt) generator replaced a permanent 500kw gen-set; the 700kw rental was the only available gen-set from the vendor that was available at that particular time.  The existing permanent generator was a 500kw @ 480 volts.  The VA opted to stay with the larger capacity 700kw rental generator.

<DESC>Security Camera questions - answers W905MW71650010 - W81R8T71650010 ***The solicitation includes the words License Plate Reader.  In normal parlance, this means that the system can capture an image of the plate and use optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to convert the license plate number to an ascii represen tation that can be stored in a database as part of a transaction, along with a compressed version of the image.  This would allow you to be able to search through the transactions using the license number and also to be able to create a hot list of license  numbers that would trigger an alarm when a vehicle with a license number that is on the hot list passes through a gate.  Is this what was envisioned here or are you just looking to capture the rear image of each vehicle and store it for three days.   ***Answer: We want to capture the license Plate and driver of the vehicle and be able to store and download the information if needed. ***The solicitation states that the system shall have the ability to be monitored, recorded, and operated from a central dispatch center up to 10 miles from the camera.  Are we to assume that the communications link exists between the central dispatch cent er and the gates? ***Answer:  Yes or will be will be installed by YPG ***We assume that we would have internet connectivity at each of the gate locations.   ***Answer:  Your assumption is correct. ***In a visit to YPG one year ago, the Main entrance was made up of an Enter lane lined with cement  barriers forcing a zigzag  approach.   There was a separate Exit lane. The Gate to the Commissary/PX Area was the same.  Are the other two  gates in questi on similar? ***Answer:  There are three other gates and yes they are similar. ***My only question is, item no. 9, Operational range from 15 to at least 50 feet.  Is this for the overview camera or the LPR system? ***Answer: The LPR system ***Through research on the Yuma Proving grounds facility, we are aware that there is an extensive network of fiber optic links between tests sites and remote facilities.  Are there any existing and available fiber links between the proposed camera location s (4 gates) and the remote viewing station locale?   If not, could they be provided? ***Answer: Yes, the could be provided by YPG

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification concerning the panels and their intended use. The panels will to be used in a structural application.  The design of the structures should be to both maximize bending rigidity (stiffness) and maximize strength (resistance to crushing).  The panels will be subjected to structural loads, including shear  loads derived from panel bending.  There is no requirement (or need) to resist heat.  The structures do not need to be air tight (or sealed); however the structure shall contain 2 solid face sheets (joined by a core) but shall be open to air laterally. The panels must be constructed with face sheets that are one piece 30 inches x 30 inches minimum.  The final structure cannot be a collection of smaller panels welded together, laterally, to reach the 30 inch x 30 inch minimum.  Also, the panels shall be s imilar from one end to another and no end support shall be part of the structures.  Thus, there shall be no lip or need for crimping at the end of the panels. The periodic core structure is an open cell structure that can be created from slender beams (trusses) of any cross sectional shape in any configuration to maximize the combination of strength and bending rigidity. As a result of this amendment the closing date for receipt of proposals is changed to 7 September 2007 by 1100 hours.
