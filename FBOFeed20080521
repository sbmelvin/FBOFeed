<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of NanoThermal Interfaces (NTI).  The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of ideas based on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the interface layer (often called the TIM) between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heatsink (this might be based on technologies developed in the DARPA-sponsored TGP and/or MACE programs, respectively).  In addition to reductions in the thermal resistance of the TIM, DARPA is interested in practical considerations, such as reliability, the ability to rework the interface, and application at modest temperatures and in conventional environments.  Additionally, DARPA is interested in concepts which can provide very high thermal conduction in the direction between the device and the spreader, while allowing shear due to differential thermal expansion between the device and spreader.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred.  (BAA08-42@darpa.mil) . See attached full BAA.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the development of engineering model and flightmodel Electron Spectrometer Power Converter (ESPC), Ion Spectrometer Power Converter(ISPC), and Data Processing Power Converter (DPPC) electronic boards, and associateddocumentation for the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI).	  NASA/GSFC is responsible forproviding the key science suite in support of the Level 1 mission objectives for theMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.  This is accomplished through the development ofa suite of instruments called the FPI.	The FPI is made up of four (4) Dual IonSpectrometers (DIS), four (4) Dual Electron Spectrometers (DES), and an Instrument DataProcessing Unit (IDPU).  Each FPI suite will fly on each of the four MMS spacecraft. The primary requirement for this procurement is the development-through-delivery of: 1)One (1) Engineering Model (EM), one (1) Qualification Model (QM) and eighteen (18) ESPCassemblies for the FPI DES; 2) one (1) EM, one (1) QM and eighteen (18) ISPC assembliesfor the FPI DIS; and 3) two (2)EM, two (2) QM and twelve (12) Flight Model DPPCassemblies for the FPI IDPU.NASA/GSFC intends to issue Request for Proposal No. NNG08243785R,  on a sole-source basisto Space Power Electronics, Inc..

<CONTACT>Marcia  - Goldman, contracting officer, Phone 301-496-2302, Fax 301-402-3407, Email goldmanm@od.nih.gov
<DESC>HIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with: McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, 20 N. Martingale Road, Suite 500, Schaumberg, Illinois 60173. No solicitation exists for this requirement.  The products are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  The total contracted dollar amount will not exceed $5.5 million; therefore it will be solicited under the Commercial Test Program as authorized under FAR 13.5. This action is under the authority of  The period of performance is 120 days after start date.  It is believed that McGladrey & Pullen, LLP Thomson Scientific is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 per FAR Part 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 because of the below:

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure royalty audit services from McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, 20 N. Martingale Road, Suite 500, Schaumberg, Illinois 60173.  This audit is to verify that GSK Biologicals has properly reported sales of licensed products and paid the proper amount of earned royalties due under the terms of two NIH patent licenses, L-380-91 and L-074-94, which GSK Biologicals terminated effective December 31, 2007.  The audit will cover sales of licensed products for the period extending from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007.  In addition to verifying licensed product sales and the calculation of earned royalty payments for that period, the audit will also address certain discrepant or possibly non-compliant findings from a previous audit covering the period January 1, 1999 through June 30, 2004 performed by McGladrey & Pullen in 2004.  Inherent duplication of cost already incurred by the Government for the January 1, 1999 through June 30, 2004 period make competition unfeasible for this final closeout audit.  

Because McGladrey & Pullen conducted the previous audit (Contract # 263-MF 418841), they are already familiar with the world-wide licensed product distribution and sales accounting systems used by GSK.  McGladrey & Pullen are also familiar with financial terms of the two licenses and the net sales calculation and earned royalty reporting process GSK uses.  Finally, McGladrey & Pullen are fully aware of the issues raised in the previous audit since they conducted the audit and identified the issues.  These include:

•	Inspecting actual invoices & shipping tickets at two distribution centers to verify sales journal entries used as a basis for reporting net sales.
•	Verifying amounts of royalties paid Merck used partially as a basis for reducing the earned royalty paid NIH.
•	Verifying the appropriateness of inconsistent discounts and credits applied against gross sales at different distribution centers.

Awarding the close-out audit contract to McGladrey & Pullen would allow the government to take advantage of the knowledge base McGladrey & Pullen acquired during their previous audit of GSK and avoid the need to pay another audit firm for the time needed to develop this expertise. For these reasons, NIAID believes that McGladrey & Pullen should be selected to conduct the close-out audit.  
Scope of Work

Under Title 35 U.S.C. § 207(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 404.12, and further delimited under the provisions of the subject license agreements by and between the NIH and GSK (Licensee), the NIH shall have the right, at its expense, through a certified public accountant (hereinafter, Contractor) or like person reasonably acceptable to GSK (hereinafter, Licensee), to examine records of all sales of licensed products under the subject licenses granted to determine if OTT received the proper amount of royalty payments specified under their license agreements for use of NIH technologies.  

A Contractor shall conduct an audit of:

NIH Licenses:	L-380-91 (Effective Date:  1 August 1985 (Attachment Two); Amended 5 April 1994 (Attachment Three); and L-075-94 (Effective Date:  27 February 1996 (Attachment Four))
Licensee: 	GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals with Corporate Headquarters or Place of Business in Rixensart, Belgium 
Licensed Products :	Havrix®, Twinrix® and Hepatyrix® 	
Licensed Patents:  	Please Refer to Tables One and Two

The audit shall cover the sales reporting period from 1 January 1996 through 31 December 2007.  

The Contractor shall follow-up and answer questions raised on selected discrepant or possible noncompliant findings from McGladrey & Pullen’s 2004 Audit Report.  The discrepant or possible noncompliant findings are listed in Table Three.

The Licensee withheld royalties after domestic and foreign patents were inadvertently allowed to lapse in 2004 for non-payment of maintenance and annuity fees.  Attempts were made to restore the lapsed patents but were not fully successful.  Contractor shall verify the royalty payments from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007 were proper and correct with respect to payments for said lapsed and restored payments.
 
The Contractor shall review the Licensee’s sales records to test the gross sales figures for all areas where Licensed Products were sold and to verify that the Licensee has accounted for all the Licensed Product sales when reporting net sales and earned royalties due for the period covered by the audit.  Contractor shall perform a detailed calculation of royalties owed on net sales of Licensed Product in accordance with the subject license agreements.  Specifically, using appropriate accounting and auditing procedures, the Contractor shall perform a limited audit that includes at least the following elements:

1.	Compliance Review Preparation:  

	Prior to visiting the Licensee’s place of business to audit sales and financial records, the Contractor, under a confidential nondisclosure agreement, will be provided background information by an OTT Monitoring and Enforcement Specialist (the “Project Officer”).  The NIH Project Officer will prepare and send an audit confirmation letter to the Licensee and assist in coordinating the scheduling of the on-site visits by the Contractor at the Licensee’s place of business and distribution centers.  The Contractor shall determine from the Licensee the type of accounting system and data availability for the period to be audited.

Table Three:	Selected Discrepant or Possible Noncompliant Findings from the GSK 2004
 		Audit Report										

Point from the 
2004 Audit Report	
Discrepant or Possible Noncompliant Finding	
Resolution

(6)	
Trend analyses of sales by licensed products were prepared but not included in the 2004 Audit Report.

It is not clear from the text whether the Contractor prepared trend analyses based on gross or net sales and there is no mention of any periodic sales fluctuations over the period as requested in the SOW.
	
Contractor to provide schedules summarizing gross sales from net sales by both product and license and by geographic region (domestic vs. foreign).  Further, there must be a test of the gross and net sales figures based on sales invoices and shipping tickets.


(7)	
The Contractor noted that the Merck & Co. royalty stacking provision is for sales in the United States, Canada and Spain.  Further, the Contractor was unable to determine whether the intent of the royalty stacking provision was to limit the credit taken by Licensee on sales of NIH Licensed Product, where both NIH and Merck & Co. earn a royalty on the sale of similar products in the same country.	
As the license agreements are silent with respect to our ability to review third-party agreements, and given the inability of the Contractor to discern the intent of the above stacking provision, the Contractor shall review the entire Merck & Co. Agreement with the Licensee and ascertain whether Licensee applied the proper credit against royalty payments due the NIH.

Contractor to verify amounts of royalties were actually paid by Licensee to Merck for a Hepatitis A (Giesa) patent license and whether these amounts correspond to what Licensee reported to NIH.  


(8)	
Unable to review Licensee’s sales amounts and correlate this information with actual invoices and shipping tickets.  Licensee did not provide detailed sales reports in conjunction with the appropriate sales invoices.  Instead, Licensee provided selected invoices for review.  	
Without the detailed sales reports and associated invoices or random samples thereof, the Contractor was unable to verify the accuracy and evaluate the integrity of the financial information presented in the royalty reports submitted to NIH by the Licensee.  In brief, the main purpose of the 2004 audit was not met and the audit report deemed inconclusive by NIAID’s Office of Financial Management.  Inspect actual invoices and shipping tickets at a minimum of two distribution centers, one U.S. and one European and correlate this data with licensee’s sales figures.



(11)	
Sales journals from the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States were reviewed and it was found that the total sales amounts and quantities sold were in agreement with the royalty computations without exception.  However, the Contractor was not able to verify the accuracy of the journal entries as they were not given actual invoices and/or shipping tickets.
	
Journal entries must be verified by actual invoices and/or shipping tickets.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit at the selected distribution centers.

(12)	
Based on an inventory usage reasonableness test, it is noted that shipments from Belgium to the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States exceeded the reported sales figures by approximately 10% for 2002 and 2003.	
It is unclear whether this test was applied to any other years.  However, the Contractor noted that it did not have access to ending inventory quantities or scrap rates, which may explain the discrepancy.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout audit.


(15)	
Licensee requested a $1.57 million dollar credit for royalties paid on U.S. government sales during the period 1995 through 2001 under the non-exclusive license.  Licensee did not provide actual invoices but instead relied on sales figures from management or “channel” reports.  Based on these reports, approximately 75% of the sales were directed to the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) which may be deemed a valid U.S. government sale.  Whereas, 25% of the sales were directed at non-government entities such as the American Red Cross and would not qualify under the specified U.S. government sales credit.  
	
This credit should be denied until Licensee provides the proper supporting documentation.  Further, if this credit is allowed at some future date, it would probably be in our best interest to apply the credit before the Merck & Co. stacking credit.

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit.

(16)	
Inconsistencies were noted in the application of discounts and credits (e.g., customer discounts, U.S. sales credit and corporate credits) in worksheets reflecting U.S. sales data.  At one Licensee facility in the United States, “the difference between the gross sales and net sales was almost 50% of sales.” 	
The Contractor was unable to verify these discrepancies.  However, this difference is significantly out of line with historical sales data on licensed products..

Address matter in the Follow-Up/Closeout Audit.



 Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit capability statements to the Contract Specialist by June 4, 2008, at 3PM EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Address responses to the attention of Marcia Goldman at National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, MSC 7663, Rockville, MD 20852.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541211 with a business size of 7.5 million dollars or email me at goldmanm@od.nih.gov.

<DESC>The combatant craft community of the US Navy has been advancing the state of the art in littoral warfare craft design for the Special Operations Forces, Riverine Forces and Marine Corps.  The craft have become very mission oriented and are built for a particular user and mission profile in the littoral or riverine environment.  These craft art increasingly required to interface with one another and may operate unmanned in an autonomous or semi-autonomous mode.  Because of these factors, the craft and/or the craft modules require different electronics suites with varying levels of integration and capabilities.The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, Philadelphia intends to procure a Craft Integrated Electronics Suite (CIES) and situational awareness components and software that are compatible with the craft's baseline electronics suite.  In order to improve the ability of the current and follow-on craft to meet diverse operational requirements and to provide maximum adaptability and flexibility, a larger scope of effort is required to meet the new and current demands of combatants involved in the GWOT.  All of these suites have a common baseline of hardware and software equipment and functions.  As part of the GWOT, there are many new requirements for all units involved in the conflict.  Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection/defeat, super computers to break down data onsite, Biometrics, and the increased requirement for wideband communications to provide this information to other units and to the TOCs are several of many requirments that are currently required.  The Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract.  The proposed contract action is for the services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Azimuth, Incorporated, 3741 Margantown Industrial Park, Morgantown, WV 26501-3700, under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current ‘state of the art’ both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHS’s return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Department’s enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHS’s two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHS’s geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Department’s Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

•‘Ad hoc’ street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

•Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. ‘Gazetteer’ level functionality)

•Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc…)

•Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

•Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

•Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
•Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
•Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
•U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
•National Operations Center (NOC)
•U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

•The estimated monthly volume of ‘ad hoc’ geocoding requests………. ….   500,000
•The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests……………... 1,000,000
•The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests……. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

•Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
•Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
•Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
•Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

2. RESPONSE GUIDELINES & REQUIRED FORMAT

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

• Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

• ‘Gazetteer’ Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

• Exact/Partial Street Address
• City/Neighborhood/County Name
• Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc…)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential ‘call center’ application and provide a flexible ‘gazetteer’ level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

• ‘Ad-hoc’ Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ‘ad hoc’ or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed ‘plug-ins’, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

• ‘Geo’-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government.  The NAICS for this procurement is code 236220.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.
The work includes but is not limited to a complete renovation of approximately 15,075 square feet of interior space located on the 8th Floor of the Poff Federal Building Roanoke, Virginia.  The renovation will involve complete demolition of the existing space with installation of all new Division 9 finishes.

The estimate dollar value for the procurement is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection process.  As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the RFP. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability;  1) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past five (5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least comparable dollar size. These shall be projects in which the offeror performed duties as the general contractor. Projects performed with a subcontractor who acted in a teaming capacity to assist with general contractor duties shall also be considered acceptable.  2) Management and Key Personnel Qualifications - offerors will be requested to identify the Project Manager and the Superintendent for the proposed project.  During construction, the position of Project Manager and Superintendent cannot deviate from that individual contained in the proposal, without approval by GSA.  The Project Manager and Superintendent must have at least five (5) years of similar experience in occupied facilities.  The resume should state the length of years experience with the current firm.  It needs to include professional qualifications; specialized experience in this type of work and the technical competence on similar projects.  A complete project list of similar project experience for the Project Manager and the Superintendent shall be requested to demonstrate that they meet the minimum experience level.  3) Technical and Organizational Approach - the offeror shall fully discuss in narrative format the following two areas: A) Basic Construction Approach to building renovations, providing a narrative describing the team's approach to planning and administration and listing any special project challenges that the contractor foresees.  The offeror shall also list any measures they intend to implement in order to minimize disruption of the occupied facility during construction operations. B) Scope of Work/Preliminary Schedule - offerors must provide a preliminary work plan outlining the major construction activities including their scopes of work, duration and anticipated schedule.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) Procurement Division, on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to make an award for an Automated Segmented Flow Analyzer for TTB’s Beverage Alcohol Lab (BAL) in Beltsville, MD.  TTB’s Compliance Lab has previously obtained ISO 17025 accreditation utilizing the Astoria-Pacific Flow Analyzer, and as the Beltsville lab has need of assisting with the volatile acidity testing, the exact same instrument is required in order to transfer the validated method/ISO accreditation to the Beverage Alcohol Lab.  In addition, for chemist certification samples, volatile acidity will be a required test. Since BAL analyzes the chemist certification samples, it is necessary for BAL to have the equipment needed to carry out these analyses. The Government intends to award a contract for the new equipment, two-year warranty, installation, and related in-house training and technical support.

Mission:  TTB’s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  TTB’s Lab has need of a new Automated Segmented Flow Analyzer system to include a sampler, detector, software, auxiliary pump for system, and volatile acidity cartridge. Part of the validation package includes utilization of colorimetric segmented continuous flow technology, with the capability of analysis rates of 48 samples per hour.  This equipment is critical to TTB’s mission, as there is a need for the volatile acidity testing, along with maintaining the validation package and ISO 17025 accreditation established by the Compliance lab.
 
No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than ten days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate an award to Astoria-Pacific.

The NTD is the primary source of statistics on the transit industry in the U.S.  The NTD collects detailed financial, operational, and capital asset data each year from over 650 transit providers in urbanized areas across the Nation, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  Each month, these transit providers also report data on ridership, service operations, and safety and security to the NTD.  Additionally, State, Territorial, and Tribal Departments of Transportation report data on behalf of over 1,400 transit providers in rural areas.  Under 49 USC 5335 [Title 49, United States Code, Section 5335], which establishes the National Transit Database, all recipients of FTA Formula Grants under 49 USC 5307 (Urbanized Area Formula Grants) and under 49 USC 5311 (Formula Grants for Other Than Urbanized Areas) must report to the NTD.  A number of transit providers in urbanized areas also report voluntarily to the NTD in order to benefit their local urbanized area in the apportionment of Urbanized Area Formula Grants.  The contractor, through the use of subject matter experts, shall be responsible for effectively managing the NTD processes of collecting data from the required sources, providing technical assistance on the data requirements to reporters, validating the data collected, analyzing the data, and publicizing findings and results.  The contractor must be able to develop revisions to NTD systems, software, validation procedures, and Manuals for the upcoming year, while beginning data collection for the current year, and while completing validation for data from the previous year.  A "draft" statement of work (SOW) is provided.   

All small business concerns that are able to provide the services described above, are encouraged to forward their capability statement (not to exceed 5 pages) to the point of contact (POC) identified below.  Capability statements are to be submitted electronically, no later than June 9, 2008 to the POC identified below.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a cost reimbursement-type contract for the effort described below. Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued. The anticipated period of performance shall be no more than 30 months from the effective date of the contract. The estimated budget for this contract is $500,000.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations that address three important issues related to the most serious air quality problems for the nation.  These include a somewhat more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone promulgated on March 12, 2008; new standards for fine particles announced in October, 2006; and regional haze regulations to protect and improve visibility in the national parks and wilderness areas first promulgated in 1999 and revised in 2005. The OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(8)) requires the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate and administer regulations that comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and to the extent that authorized activities significantly affect the air quality of any State. To improve the tools needed to fulfill these responsibilities, MMS has identified the need to conduct meteorological field measurements that can be used for improving meteorological and air quality modeling; such observations would reduce uncertainty in numerical modeling and hence in environmental assessments. For the Gulf of Mexico marine environment, existing data sets do not present a complete vertical profile of temperature, winds, moisture, and mixing through the atmospheric boundary layer and free atmosphere. There are no meteorological data between the sea surface and 200 ~ 300m. Filling this information gap is vital to air dispersion modeling.  The properties of the air-sea interface and the sub-surface layer are also crucial in determining the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer.  The characteristics of boundary layer, including the mean and turbulent states of the atmosphere govern the air pollution transport and dispersion and transfer of momentum, heat, and moisture from the ocean surface to the atmosphere.  In the past, MMS has conducted several meteorological studies in the GOM; however, these wind measurements need further updating for offshore meteorological and air quality assessments and to obtain data on boundary layer characteristics, including mixing height.  There is also an ongoing emission data collection study that requires meteorological data for air quality modeling. The proposed study will take advantage of existing boundary layer studies and provide updated data and information for improving the accuracy of meteorological and air quality modeling. The information gathered from previous studies will help set up a more comprehensive field measurement system to collect more accurate wind data.  Therefore, in this study, it is proposed to install a meteorological measurement system offshore to obtain information for atmospheric boundary layer study. The meteorological measurements will improve the application of meteorological and air quality models in the offshore environment and the coastal area. The data will be used to improve air quality modeling used to predict and assess 8 hour ozone, visibility, and haze in NEPA documents.  The goal of this project is mainly to collect meteorological data over the ocean that can be used to provide a more complete understanding of the marine boundary layer which could then lead to the development of better algorithms for the over water meteorological model, and that can be used to characterize the atmospheric boundary layer structure in the marine environment for improving meteorological and air quality modeling over coastal transition zone, shallow water and deep water areas.  Furthermore, this study is to focus on the data gaps between sea surface to 200 - 300m.  Although the focus of this study is in the lowest 200-300m; the "entire" atmospheric boundary layer will also be considered in an option. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: (1) To deploy meteorological monitoring equipment at one or more locations for at least one year, (2) To collect basic meteorological (wind, temperature, and moisture) and turbulence data, to obtain vertical profile for these parameters, including the lowest 200-300m, and to obtain information for surface fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum, (3) To disseminate the data on a routine basis, and to perform QA/QC, data verification, and data display, and (4) To process the monitoring data and synthesize the results. This study consists of one minor task and six (6) main tasks: Minor task: (1) Establishing Scientific Review Group (SRG) and Conducting a post award and a mid-term meeting. Main tasks:  (1).    Field Work Plan; (2).  Data Processing Work Plan; (3). Deployment and Operation of the Meteorological Monitoring Equipment; (4).   Processing of Monitored Data, including QA/QC and data display; (5).   Developing and Maintaining an Internet web-site Archive; (6) Options for Added Values and Study Enhancement; (7) Complete and prepare a synthesis report.

EVALUATION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENT: Your capabilities statement will be evaluated on the basis of these criteria: (1) Your key personnel, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications, specific expertise, and experience.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of atmospheric boundary layer, turbulence and diffusion, air-sea interaction, and field experiment as well as some familiarity with the meteorological and air quality modeling as demonstrated by qualifications and authorship in peer-reviewed publications.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled "COMIDA: Impact Monitoring for Offshore Subsistence Hunting" for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  Please read this notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued.  The Minerals Management Service Procurement Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541720-Research & Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be four years with an estimated cost range between $550,000 to $600,000.  Background:  This study will constitute a key component of Chukchi Sea environmental studies pertinent to the management decisions resulting from the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 held in February 2008, and subsequent sales scheduled for 2010 and 2012.  Specifically, this study will initiate monitoring efforts of offshore subsistence hunting for key marine mammals among the communities most proximate to the Sale Area and to currently anticipated development scenarios.  The MMS seeks to establish an updated baseline in the area and to monitor on an annual basis any significant changes in offshore subsistence harvest activities over time.  The oil and gas industry has expressed strong interest in leasing in this Planning Area under Sale 193, which may be followed by further exploration and possibly development.  In order to assure methodological continuity over time for a potentially large exploration area, appropriate planning and implementation of post-lease monitoring baselines are needed.  The COMIDA Workshop in November 2006 recommended the monitoring of offshore subsistence hunting.  In particular, the workshop concluded that monitoring efforts should be directed toward the hunt for marine mammals, including bowhead and beluga whales, walrus, seals, and possibly polar bears.  There is little up-to-date information about offshore subsistence activities along the Chukchi coast, and there is acute need for more information in the vicinity of Wainwright and Point Lay, where development might make landfall.  The voluntary participation of host communities will ultimately depend upon their consent and continued endorsement of the study design.  It is anticipated that residents of these communities will support such a research effort and will be actively engaged with ethnographic fieldworkers in the conceptual design of fieldwork strategies, in the collection of relevant data, and in the review of research findings. MMS would encourage the contractor to borrow from the successful conceptual design of the long-term monitoring efforts of bowhead whale hunting activities near Cross Island in the Beaufort Sea under previous MMS funded projects.  MMS analysts and decision makers will use the information from this study in NEPA analysis and documentation for Lease Sales, Exploration Plans, Development and Production Plans, and in post-sale and post-exploration decision making in the Chukchi Sea.
This study will consist of seven tasks and will gather long-term monitoring data to allow the MMS to assess whether OCS oil development activities in the Chukchi Sea will result in changes to offshore subsistence hunting practices.  The first research question is whether subsistence hunting in the Chukchi Sea displays significant variation over time.  The second question is whether such variation can be attributed to offshore oil and gas industrial activities.  These questions can be stated as hypotheses: Monitoring Hypotheses 1: Offshore subsistence hunting patterns in the vicinity of Wainwright and Point Lay do not vary significantly from year to year; Monitoring Hypotheses 2: Variation in offshore subsistence hunting patterns is not related to offshore oil and gas activities.  This overarching goal will be accomplished through the following intermediary steps: 1. Project Management: administer and communicate progress and deliverables of study efforts to designated MMS representatives; 2. Community Engagement: secure participation and cooperation of the native hunter associations and individual hunters and whaling crews in this study and in the tasks of coordination and self reporting; 3. Data Collection: initiate and continue the annual assessment of marine subsistence hunting and whaling by Wainwright and Point Lay communities; expand the research coverage in subsequent years of research (beginning in Year 2) to include Barrow, and possibly Point Hope; 4. Analyze Data: analyze and summarize annual field data sufficient to identify and interpret notable changes in offshore hunting activities over time; 5. Prepare and Submit Annual Field Reports: prepare and present the recorded field data in an annual report for each year 2008-2010; 6. Prepare and Submit Final Summary Narrative: following the last field season, compare and summarize in analytic narrative the significant results from this study; 7. Present Major Findings: present in oral and written format, using language easy to understand, the major findings of research to interested stakeholder groups.  Seven tasks include Task 1, Project Management; Task 2, Community Engagement; Task 3, Data Collection; Task 4, Analyze Data; Task 5, Prepare and Submit Annual Field Reports; Task 6, Submit Final Narrative Summary; Task 7, Present Major Findings.  How to Respond: If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please e-mail your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address and DUNS Number not later than 2:00 p.m. E.T., Monday, June 9, 2008, to debra.bridge@mms.gov., or send this same information to Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170.  Please reference M08PS00068, COMIDA:  Impact Monitoring for Offshore Subsistence Hunting, in your document.  Those organizations responding to this announcement will receive a copy of the full Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHD/NSWC) is seeking companies with technical expertise and experience in the production of radio frequency (RF) controlled detonators.  
The IHD/NSWC has developed a programmable remotely-fired detonator system known as the Electronic Blasting Cap System (E-CAPS) that consists of a transmitter and up to fifteen receivers/detonators.  The receivers are programmed (via the transmitter) to detonate through a uniquely encoded radio frequency (RF) signal.  Each receiver can be programmed to detonate immediately or after a programmed delay.  The receivers are one time use devices whereas transmitters are reusable.  The Government anticipates initial quantities per year for these devices to be 50-150 transmitters and 1000-2500 receivers.
The E-CAPS transmitter is 4.8 inches in length, 2.7 inches in width, 1.5 inches in height and weighs approximately 6.4 ounces.  The transmitter design consists of an RF transceiver and antenna, programmable circuitry and programming buttons, LED display, and a single covered firing button.  The E-CAPS receiver is 5.25 inches in length, 2.80 inches in width and 1.25 inches in height.  The weight of the E-CAPS receiver is approximately 6.8 ounces.  The receiver design consists of an RF transceiver and antenna, programming buttons, LED display, and arming pull tab.  The receiver internally houses a Spider Exploding Foil Initiator (EFI) detonator (manufactured by Reynolds Systems) that uses a 370 mg pellet of RSI-007 as the explosive output.  In addition the receiver unit holds a fuze well adaptor that contains a blasting cap with 2.1 grams of PBX-9407 explosive.  The fuze well adaptor/blasting cap is externally stowed in the detonation cord slot across the top of the receiver.  
Both the receiver and transmitter units are currently enclosed in urethane housings.  However, the government is in the process of upgrading the existing design to accommodate additional requirements & reduce parts costs, to include changing to an injection molded plastic case.  
Manufacturing of these devices requires an extensive background in the production of RF circuitry; technical expertise to sustain quality throughout all phases of the production process; a facility equipped to support explosive loading of these devices; and an established internal quality control system. 
All responding sources shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including organization name, address, a description of facilities and/or equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production capacity per month. 
It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 06 June 08 to:

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation<BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Devices.           <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare System, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   <BR><BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor or vendors of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martin-tilghman@amedd.army.mil.    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Devices, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.  Within this region, this product line has a projected annual dollar estimated requirement of $74,572.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 3-month period and includes the following top high volume usage lines for this project: <BR><BR>PART # 	DESCRIPTION<BR>02S001		Wound Care Device For Head, Neck, Torso & Upper Leg, Delivers Topical Hyperbaric Oxygen<BR>		To Wounds<BR>02B001		Wound Care Device For Arm, Hand & Lower Leg.  Delivers Topical Hyperbaric Oxygen To <BR>                              Difficult Wounds<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  larry.shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil (202-782-3666).  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on June 10, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.      <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  <BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  <BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  <BR>3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Devices.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line.

Individual products packaging must be clearly labeled as to size/size range/body area.    <BR>2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment System and Device product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Prime Vendor for the Northeast Region is Owens-Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Provide documentation of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.   <BR>5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR><BR>6.  Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment delivery devices product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant, i.e. positive resolutions, etc., in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  <BR>7.  Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment delivery devices to be supplied.  Provide this electronic information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFRIAQ.  Provide information explaining whether or not the instructions/directions are supplied with the individual item packaging, or are provided with the larger units of packaging only, i.e. per case, etc.<BR>8.  Vendors must provide inservice/implementation and ongoing educational support as needed by Regional MTFs.  Vendors must identify company resources for such requirements in response to this RFRIAQ.  Provide electronic literature, if available, describing this support.    <BR>9.  Vendor must provide Customer Service during routine business hours (Monday-Friday 9:00AM-5:00PM) and identify company resources for such support in response to this RFRIAQ.    <BR>10.  Vendors must provide a list of vendor production and product safety standards under which all itemized brand(s) and styles are manufactured and/or distributed for Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment delivery devices.  Vendors must provide a complete list of these standards and the vendors mechanism to assure that all quoted products meet these standards in response to this RFRIAQ. The vendor will clearly state the compliance with these standards in the literature. <BR>11.  Vendors must provide products that are latex-free.        <BR>      12. Vendors must provide samples and descriptions of the labeling which includes labeling of lot number in response to this RFRIAQ.     <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets from the product group at no cost to the Government or the TRBO POC recipient, to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  Vendors will be given ten (10) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the TRBO Clinical Analyst.  Requested no-cost product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets.  No cost sample sets must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT on the 10th calendar day.  Those vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the no cost sample sets required by COB 4:00 PM EDT on the 10th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) week (7 calendar days).    Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Extremely Poor; Two (2)Below Average; Three (3)Average; Four (4)Above Average; and Five (5)Excellent.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   <BR><BR>The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending  on the location of any break: in vendors Total Averaged Scores ((i.e. a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score Clinically Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score:  <BR><BR>1.  [Care Efficiency] Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Device application and complete skin contact/adhesion seal including Device edge-seal continuity (to both torso areas and extremities) is effortless.      <BR>a. Device must fully adhere to patients skin during treatment to assure a continuous therapeutic oxygen concentration level for effective wound treatment and healing.        <BR>b. Evaluator places Device on skin/extremity observes for ease of application and adequacy of initial skin contact/adhesion seal including edge-seal continuity.    <BR>2. [Continuity of Therapy] Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Device maintains complete skin contact/adhesion seal including Device edge-seal continuity during treatment use.      <BR>      a. Device must fully adhere to patients skin during treatment to assure a continuous therapeutic oxygen concentration level for effective wound treatment and healing.          <BR>b. Evaluator observes device in place on patients skin for breaks in seal and observes any loosening of seal with patient movement or gentle manipulation of the device.  <BR>2. [Patient Comfort and Patient Safety] Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Device does not impair blood circulation or sensation to extremities during use.    <BR>      a. Impaired circulation or nerve function in extremities further compromises wound healing and patient health during the length of each recommended 90-minute treatment.        <BR>b. Evaluator will observe patients extremity for discoloration and/or any patient complaints of numbness/tingling/discomfort in the extremity during use.   <BR>3.  [Patient Comfort and Patient Safety] Disposable Topical Oxygen Wound Treatment Delivery Device is easily removed from skin contact without causing injury to tissue.  <BR>a. Injury to tissue surrounding wound further compromises healing process and patient health.      <BR>b. Evaluator will observe for difficulty in removing Delivery Device after completed treatment, and evaluator will observe for injury to tissue from adhesive contact to skin both during removal and after removal.     <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Regionrepresents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched productsand  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Linesunmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendorreduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, is more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the impact of RIA prices is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation and meet the Clinically Acceptability target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Scoredepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Score (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Score) as determined by the CPT will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria and are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified form further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      <BR><BR>3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds.   in a proscribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.<BR><BR>4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested I the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendors quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  <BR><BR>The Northeast Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   <BR><BR>5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.   <BR> _____________________________________________________________________________<BR>END<BR>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to issue a sole source contract to procure field level maintenance support, training support, depot level maintenance support, technical support, help desk support, spare parts and miscellaneous services and support to directly support ongoing procurement actions of fielded VRC-110 radio systems, consisting of Tactical Hand Held Radio (THHR) units and Dual Vehicular Adapters (DVA) for the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  The VRC-110 was procured through a General Services Administration contract (M67854-07-A-7073) with Harris Corporation, RF Division.   MARCORSYSCOM intends to award the contract to Harris Communications, RF Division, 1680 University Ave, Rochester NY. 14610.  Market research has shown that there are no third-party service providers authorized to conduct service on the Harris VRC-110.  The use of non-authorized maintenance providers will cause the Original Equipment Manufacturer warranty to be v!  oided. Support and services are expected to be required at multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. The contract awarded under this action is expected to be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery ? Indefinite Quantity contract with a maximum value of approximately $76 million.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract under this action in February, 2008. No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than 3:00pm local time on 28 JAN 2008 to Maj. Joseph Butkus at joseph.butkus@usmc.mil.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Parties that intend to submit a statement of capability are asked to notify the Government of that intent no later than 3:00pm local time on Jan 3, 2008. Numbered Note:  22

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's, 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) program is a State formula-grant program authorized under Title IV, Part B, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.  The No Child Left Behind Act converted the 21st CCLC program from discretionary grants, administered directly by Department of Education, to a program in which each State receives an allotment under a formula based on their share of Title I, Part A funds.  States must use their allocations to make competitive awards to eligible entities.  Grants made under the antecedent program will continue to be managed at the Federal level until they expire.  The Secretary may reserve up to one percent of the total appropriation for the 21st CCLC program to carry out an array of national activities, including but not limited to national evaluations and the technical assistance.

The objective of the 21st CCLC program is to enable community learning centers to have the ability to plan, implement, or expand after-school learning enrichment opportunities to help students meet State and local standards in core content areas.  21st CCLC programs must primarily serve children who attend schools identified with high-poverty, while also giving priority to serving children in low-performing schools based on State standards.

Scope of Work

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) intends to establish a contract that will be used provide continued technical assistance through a professional development module to help State and local programs throughout the country design and implement research-based, effective afterschool learning opportunities for children primarily in high-poverty, low-performing schools.  Under this procurement, the contractor shall design professional development databases and modules using a hybrid of distance learning techniques, train the trainer techniques, and regional study circles to increase the capacity of local 21st CCLC project and program directors to use nationally recognized best practices to improve the academic outcomes of their participating students.  These databases and modules will focus on equipping afterschool program staff with the knowledge and background in program and activity design best practices so that program staffs may create curricula and activities that use local academic outcomes and objectives to design hands-on, experiential, and participatory activities that are different from the methodology used to deliver the same content during the school day.  All features would be housed on a web-based portal on the website of the contractor that can easily be transported to a new platform at the end of the contract period.

Several aspects of this contract require strong collaboration and coordination among distinct entities involved in the model identification and dissemination process.  Additionally, the contractor must have access to and be knowledgeable of the information and materials pertaining to after-school programs to ensure that it has the capabilities to be thoroughly familiar with existing literature on effective afterschool content-area curriculum, specifically in the areas of reading, mathematics, and science and professional development.  The main deliverable of this contract will be an interactive web portal encompassing several distinct sections.  This portal will provide:

*  A technology-based, user-centric one-stop infrastructure that includes a virtual gateway for State coordinators and sub-grantees to select academic and learning strategies, classroom instructional materials, staff and instructional training modules, best business practices, and program evaluation tools;

*  Evaluation strategies and tools that will eliminate duplication, and enhance quality and consistency across the program;

*  A large and robust online learning and professional development system that will provide increased, consistent, customized, and focused afterschool information and strategies for the entire 21st CCLC community;

*  A communication tool that includes access to State 21st CCLC activity calendars, message boards, blackboards, meeting-conference webinar access, and other community-driven communication tools;

*  A virtual gateway for States and sub-grantees to select from a menu of comprehensive, innovative, and creative best practices and professional development training modules that are specific to the needs of the respective State and/or sub-grantee programs.

Request for Information Response

This request for information is limited to small businesses only!!  All interested small businesses are encouraged to respond to this Request for Information with a brief capability statement outlining the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities in meeting Department of Education requirements by May 30, 2008, 4:00pm EST.

<SUBJECT>Standoff Laser or Non-Laser Optical Techniques for the Detection of Trace Amounts of Explosives on Vehicles
<SOLNBR>RSIE-08-00014
<RESPDATE>062008
<CONTACT>Albert J Dainton, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6371, Email albert.dainton@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) in collaboration with the Technical Support Working Group issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding a standoff laser or non-laser optical technique for the detection of trace quantities of explosives on vehicles.  The request is for any technology that meets the standoff requirement and detects explosives amounts in the range of micro-grams (or less) to tens of micro-grams per square centimeter. The focus of this inquiry is to identify candidate systems that would be invited to a government assessment of the state of the art.
 
Background:
In the manufacture and transport of Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED), there is the possibility of trace amounts of the explosive being deposited on the outer surfaces of the vehicle. This could be due to human handling of the IED with subsequent transfer to the surface, a contaminated area used for IED manufacture, or the IED shedding trace amounts as it is being loaded into the vehicle. This scenario is the topic of explosive trace detection research in a number of government and industrial laboratories. There are contact trace techniques for sampling and detecting this material, but the operator is put in a potentially very hazardous situation. The use of standoff non-contact techniques would greatly reduce the risk associated with trace sampling, hopefully reduce inspection time, and improve detection. 

This RFI is to assess the state of the art for the standoff trace detection of VBIED using optical techniques.  

Objective:
There are a number of systems under development for the detection of trace amounts of explosives on vehicles using laser and non-laser techniques. The government is interested in the state of the art for standoff detection of amounts ranging from micro-grams (or less) to tens of micro-grams per square centimeter. At this time, the request is for a range of system readiness from fully deployable systems, to systems that can be considered at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 and above. A TRL 5 system is defined: “The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include “high fidelity” laboratory integration of components and software”. Systems at a greater TRL are especially desirable. The assessment will be in a simulated environment, with double blind test articles, and operation by the provider with government oversight.

The evaluation will be limited to depositions of trace quantities of explosives on metal and plastic surfaces that is representative of the materials and paint/coatings found on vehicles. The assessment will be performed in an outdoor environment. The government-conducted assessment will be by invitation only. The details of the required documents to submit for consideration are contained below.


RFI Submission Requirements:
To respond to this RFI please provide no more than a ten-page white paper describing the system offered for assessment. Please provide one original hard copy and a CD containing an electronic copy.  White papers must be in Microsoft Word Format. Responses of more than 10 pages will not be reviewed. Please include the following (as appropriate) in the response:

•	Discussion of technology and measurement technique,
•	Laser wavelength and power,
•	Laser safety requirements,
•	Operational range of system,
•	Response information provided by system,
•	Minimum and maximum trace levels detectable for each explosive,
•	Scan area,
•	Scan time,
•	Response time,
•	Diagram and picture of system,
•	Power requirements,
•	Site requirements, if any,
•	Date of availability,
•	Maturity of system, and
•	Independent Reports (not included in 10 page limit)
•	Responses should include name, telephone number, and an E-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to discuss responses with the government representatives.

The initial response will have a technical assessment that may be followed by clarifications for further information or an invitation to participate in the government conducted technology assessment. Providers invited for participation will be asked to provide a data package based on government provided test specimens.

The response should be postmarked no later than June 20, 2008. The response should be sent with RFI-08-00014 promptly displayed on the envelope to:

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking small business sources to provide consulting services collaborate for a research program entitled, “Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) CT decision methods program” 
.  This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  
The CFSAN/ FERN scientists under strict and CDC approved protocols use the various kits or reagents requested by the above mentioned vendor to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nations food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance CFSAN’s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply.
1)	Cephid, OmniMix HS, Qty. 200 EA, Catalog # OMNI-100N-050.
2)	Shipping.
The FDA has a critical need for kits and reagents used to detect the characterization of foodborne pathogens. 
Cepheid is the sole producer of these unique kits and accessories.  We have been unable to find any comparable kits or substitute.  The capabilities of the Cepheid CSR and OmniMix bead real-time multiplex PCR reagents are so unique and specific for the FERN detection program, we have been unable to find any other vendor with the same standards.  
The methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the “gold standard”, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the Cepheid CSR and OmniMix bead real-time multiplex PCR reagent test kits provide uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.

REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a proposal to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

One objective was completed when the Agency published new draft and final Part 11 GMP Guidance for notice and comment.  The draft guidance was published February 23, 2003, and the final guidance was published August 2003.

This contract will include preparing, editing and reviewing pharmaceutical industry comments in preparation for a finalized and revised 21 CFR Part 11.

EVALUATION FOR AWARD
Basis for Award:
a. Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost. Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.
b. Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price. It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.
c. FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government. FDA’s acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror. Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offeror’s technical solution is evaluated. This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the government’s assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Area Details Percentage
Personnel Experience and Capability						40%

ATTACHMENT I

FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements

1.  BACKGROUND

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type.  

Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation requirement.  These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space.

2.  GENERAL

The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract:

a.	Certification that all required security form packets (See Charts A and/or B incorporated in this clause) and a list of contractor employees names for whom the requisite security information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff.

   b.  "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms
         signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.

With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor.  The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.  

Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for details on the badging process)  However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times. 

All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations.  The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract.

The position risk levels for this contract are Level 1.

There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are:

a.	Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the Agency.  The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1).  Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in Paragraph 5 below.

b.	Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs.  The forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6).  Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive security badge as well as a background investigation.

In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following information:  (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g) phone number.  The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system.  Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor.

A Contractor’s failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor’s employees being denied access to FDA property until all security processing has been completed.

3. BADGING PROCESS  

The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card.  In order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a “favorable” fingerprint return.  Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work.   Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on where the contract will be performed:

a.  Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee, contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or

b.  Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to:

Food and Drug Administration
Personnel Security Staff, OSO
5600 Fishers Lane
PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
Rockville, MD 20857

Upon the receipt of a “favorable” fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive his or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document.  Acceptable forms of photo identification are referenced on the FDA Form 3391.  Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form.  This form can be obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf

An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff. 

4.  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS

The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 1, 5 and 6 serving under this contract.  

Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to:

•	Review of prior Government/military personnel records;
•	Review of FBI records and fingerprint files;
•	Searches of credit bureaus;
•	Personal interviews; and
•	Written inquiries covering the subject's background.			
		
Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of contract performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate background investigations of contractor employees.

The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In addition, the contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes:  the Contractor's name, the contract number, the name of the Contracting Officer administering the contract, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those employees’ social security numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a separate sealed envelope marked, "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to:

Food and Drug Administration
OSO/Office of Security Operations
Attn:  Personnel Security Staff
5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
Rockville, MD  20857

The contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the contract number and employee names.

The contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations.

Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the contract employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms.

Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position.

At any time, if a contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the contract, the contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and Contracting Officers.

The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an employee is denied a clearance.  Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the contract.  Those who are not cleared must cease work on the contract immediately.

If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required.

In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of this clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer.

6.  NON-PUBLIC DATA PROTECTION

The contractor shall protect the privacy of all information reported by or about contract employees and shall protect against unauthorized disclosure.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10521, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size
standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the analysis of up to 780 water column samples for dissolved and total nutrients (complete list is below) and total suspended solids for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (U.S. EPA 2001a).  EPA will provide the contractor with a split sample consisting of a filtered and unfiltered portion of seawater from each site.  Samples will be provided in batches (as collected) over a two-year period. Dissolved nutrient analyses shall be performed on the filtered portion and total nitrogen and phosphorus on the unfiltered portion of each sample. Total 
suspended solids shall be analyzed by weighing of tared filters provided by the contractor to EPA. Samples and portions shall be clearly labeled for each part of the analysis. The contractor shall analyze a minimum of two hundred (200) samples and a maximum of 780 samples.  The period of performance of this contract is two (2) years from the date of award. The contractor shall submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols for review.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described for the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (U.S. EPA 2001b). The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice). At the end of the contract period, the contractor shall transfer 
copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as ?EPA / USVI Coastal Assessment for Nutrients and Suspended Solids - Contractor Name / Contract Number? and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box. To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, EPA requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical 
procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies. EPA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods.  Therefore, in keeping with a performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval, proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by EPA to ensure that the program?s quality standards are met. Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria for the Laboratory Determinations of: Dissolved Nutrients and Total Nutrients (N, P); Total Suspended Solids (TSS). I. Dissolved Nutrient and Total Nutrient (N, P) Analysis. Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of dissolved N (nitrite+nitrate), nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosphate, from a filtered portion 
of the seawater sample, and total N and P using an unfiltered portion shall be conducted using an auto analyzer (e.g., Technicon Auto Analyzer, or similar); the use of an auto analyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Nitrate concentration shall be determined indirectly by subtracting nitrite from nitrate+nitrite.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples. Samples exceeding the standard curve range by >10% shall be diluted and re-analyzed. Samples should be analyzed in batches consisting of 15-20 field samples per batch along with the following required QC check samples: Laboratory blank; Spike/recovery check sample; Duplicate sample. Reporting units shall be in mg/L; samples 
shall be identified to the site by using the information provided with the samples. All samples shall link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted both electronically (ASCI delimited) and in hardcopy format. Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Requirements. The basic QA/QC requirements for the analyses of total and dissolved nutrients, as described in the National Coastal Assessment Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), include the following: Method Detection Limits (MDLs) - 0.005 mg/L for N species; 0.002 mg/L for o-P; Calibration curve - correlation efficiency of =0.99; Percent Spike Recovery - ? 10% of true standard value (i.e., 90 - 110% recovery); Duplicate Analysis - Relative percent difference (RPD) of 30%;  Laboratory Blank - < 3x MDL. II. Determination of Total Suspended Solids(TSS).  
Laboratory processing consist primarily providing a tared filter to the field crews for processing the sample, once the processed filter is returned to the laboratory - drying the filter, then re-weighing to determine the weigh of residual material (suspended solids).  The preferred method for determining TSS is described in Section 6 (pp 1-3) of the EMAP- Laboratory Methods Manual-Estuaries, Volume 1: Biological and Physical Analyses (US EPA, 1995); the manual is accessible on the EMAP website [www.epa.gov/emap] under EMAP Documents by Resource Groups or refer to EPA Method 160.2: Residue, Non-Filterable Suspended Solids in Water  [www.epa.gov/rmdcrl/sop/sopdoc/AIG018.pdf]. These methods have practical application for the range of 2 to 20,000 mg/L. Quality Assurance/Quality 
Control (QA/QC) Requirements. Laboratories that conduct TSS determinations shall adhere to the prescribed procedures and meet or exceed the following QA/QC guidelines. TSS samples held under refrigeration at 4? C shall be analyzed within 90 days of collection.  If prolonged storage (>90 but <180 days) is anticipated, samples should be frozen; frozen samples shall be analyzed within 6 months of collection. Two laboratory procedures, weighing and drying the filters, are keys to success for the determination of TSS; therefore, QC records shall be maintained to document both activities. These procedures are discussed in detail in the above methods.  Performance of the laboratory balance used to weigh the samples shall be verified by a certified service representative on an annual basis. During periods of use, a QC check 
for accuracy of the balance shall be conducted weekly by using a set of standard weights (ASTM Class 2, or better).  These records shall be maintained in an instrument log book dedicated to that balance.  The temperature of the drying oven shall hold stable at 103 ? 3?C. The temperature shall be checked by thermometer and recorded on a daily basis; filters should not be left in the oven, unattended, over weekends. Along with each batch of 10-15 field samples, a blank and duplicate sample shall be analyzed. A laboratory blank of 500 ml deionized water shall be processed as per field samples; an acceptable blank results in = 0.5 mg weight increase for the dried filter.  Duplicate analyses shall be provided from the field to demonstrate measurement precision.  The relative percent difference (RPD) between duplicate 
measurements should be < 20%; this applies to samples that have TSS loads >10mg/L. Data Reporting. Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic format within 3 months of submission of each batch of samples; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or formatted text. Analytical results should be expressed as percent TOC; the laboratory shall report using the sample ID code; samples should be reported in designated batches along with the corresponding QA/QC data for each batch.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10520, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size
standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the identification and analysis of foraminifera assemblages from a maximum of 400 marine sediment samples for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using methods similar to those described in Hallock et al. (2003). EPA will provide the contractor with vials containing > 10g sediment (dry weight). Samples will be clearly labeled but replicates will not be identified until analysis is completed. The contractor shall analyze a minimum of one hundred (100) samples and a maximum of four hundredd (400) samples.  The samples will be delivered to the contractor in up to 3 batches (100 samples or more in each batch).  The period of performance 
of this contract is two (2) years from the date of award. The contractor shall submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols  for review. These protocols shall describe chain of custody, organizational flow, and record-keeping procedures to be used during the contract period. They shall also include a description of how precision and accuracy shall be determined and documented. The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice). The contractor is required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal and programmatic files regarding this contract to the EPA Project Officer at the end of the contract period. These files should be labeled as ?EPA/USVI Assessment of Foraminifera?. Required services.  The 
contractor shall split the sample saving half as archival and return to EPA if not needed. Approximately 4 g sediment shall be separated for grain size analysis (Folk 1974) and ~1 g used to identify 150-200 foraminifera to the genus (not species) level as described in Table 1. Genus-level identification is recommended because it is historically well established and an excellent basic reference is available (Loeblich and Tappan, 1987).  If deformed specimens are observed, the proportions of deformed specimens should be recorded for the three most abundant taxa. For quality assurance, at least 10% of the samples should be independently evaluated (included in total sample number). Data Reporting. Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic (Excel spreadsheet) format within 4 months of receipt 
of each batch. Results shall include grain size, raw foraminifera counts and sample weights with appropriate sample identifier and date of analysis. Analytical results shall include relative abundance (percent of a particular genus relative to all foraminifera in the sample) and absolute abundance (# specimens/gram of sediment) for each genus. The Foram Index (Hallock et al. 2003; Table 2) shall be calculated for each sample. Samples shall be reported in designated batches along with the corresponding QA/QC data for each batch. Table 1- Taxonomic identification and functional groups of foraminifera (Hallock et al. 2003) is available at the EPA Procurement website shown below. Table 2 - Calculation of the Foram Index (Hallock et al. 2003). Step 1. From each subsample examined, sort all foraminiferal specimens by genus, count, and 
record in a spreadsheet, with genera arranged by functional group. (See Table 1.) Step 2. Calculate the proportion (P) of specimens for each functional group by summing the specimens of each genus of that group (N) and dividing by the total number of specimens counted (T). a) Ps = Ns/T, where subscript ?s? represents symbiont-bearing foraminifers; b) Po = No/T, where subscript ?o? represents opportunistic foraminifers; c) Ph = Nh/T, where subscript ?h? represents other small, heterotrophic foraminifers. Step 3. Weight proportions to calculate the FORAM Index (FI):  FI = (10 x Ps) + (Po) + (2 x Ph). The EPA Procurement webiste shown below contains References and Bibliopgraphy.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation 
criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows:  A. Technical Criteria: 1.) Provide a copy of QA/QC protocols, including plans for replication of analyses. 2.)

<p><br />Prospective Offerors:</p>
<p>You are invited to submit your written proposal(s) for providing the above-mentioned services, to be received by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Office of Finance, Division of Procurement, 100 Raoul Wallenberg Place, SW, Washington, DC 20024-2126.  Written proposals (submitted electronically, preferably via e-mail) will consist of two separate volumes, "Technical" and "Business."  Both volumes will be due no later than 2:00 PM ET, Friday, June 20, 2008.  Please refer to   for all documents and instructions pertaining to this solicitation.</p>
<p>The RFP and its Exhibits are intended to provide sufficient information to allow Offerors to submit a comprehensive proposal(s).  Offerors desiring clarifications shall submit questions, in writing (preferably by e-mail), as soon as they realistically hope to get a response.</p>
<p>Also, please note that the web posting contained an errata, which will be corrected by the end of the day (May 21, 2008), to read:</p>
<p>"This revises section L.1 of the RFP to remove the GSA-schedule-only restriction in favor of full-and-open competition for all qualified Microsoft Gold-certified vendors.</p>
<p>Vendors who *have* GSA-schedule contracts are encouraged (but not required) to submit a bid which applies their GSA contract terms and conditions and which uses GSA-published rates as a ceiling, not a floor, such that pricing is maximally competitive. The advantage of this to us is in the convenience of a shared framework of contract language and a demonstrated commitment to government contracting and (presumably therefore) experience working with government clients.</p>
<p>Otherwise, and for vendors who do *not* have GSA contracts but meet all qualifications stipulated in the RFP, there are two alternative threshhold requirements:</p>
<p>1] review and consideration of applicable federal contract language, which would be applied to be applied to any award; and</p>
<p>2] demonstrated experience implementing a MOSS solution for at least two (2) government clients in the last two (2) years."</p>

<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time report which would examine recent changes and reforms in the defense industry of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and particularly those changes which increase the capabilities of this industry to produce more sophisticated and capable weapons systems. 

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	Building off of previous studies on the subject (such as the 2005 RAND Corp. study A New Direction for China’s Defense Industry), the study would produce an updated picture of the industry’s organizational infrastructure, and explicate the relationships among its major players in both government and industry.
•	Identify the sectors in which the industry has seen the most significant improvements in its ability to produce high-tech equipment. Identify as well the sectors in which the industry still appears to face difficulty in reforming itself, or otherwise continues to lag significantly behind the advanced defense industries of the U.S., Russia, Israel, etc.
•	Assess the role that U.S./Western companies may have had in contributing to improvements in the capabilities of the PRC defense industry, particularly in the area of technology transfer. Assess the extent to which access to international capital markets has strengthened PRC defense industrial companies.
•	Assess the extent to which reforms in the defense industry will allow the PRC to become less dependent on foreign weapons sales in the intermediate term (next 5-10 years).

<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time report investigating the on-going modernization and buildup of PRC military forces. Reviewing unclassified information from 2000 to the present, this study would assess their ability to carry out military action against Taiwan and against U.S. and allied forces and assets.

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	Are the expanding military operations of the PLA consistent with the peacetime operations of a professionalizing great power military, or is the PLA currently operating on a wartime footing? If the latter, what indicators would reveal this? 
•	How capable is Taiwan of defending itself against a PLA attack, and what options are available to the U.S. and its allies in the event of such an attack? 
•	The report would examine key policy statements and pronouncements by PRC civilian and military leaders during the timeframe in question (2000 to the present), and analyze China’s capability and intent to undertake military action. 
•	The report would examine the most salient aspects of the PLA’s build-up of more capable platforms in the Taiwan Strait area – mobile missiles, modern naval combatants, third- and fourth-generation aircraft, etc. – and assess the extent to which this increases the PLA’s readiness for a regional conflict. 
•	The report would also examine the operational activities of the PLA since 2000 – the ASAT test, air and maritime probes into Japanese and Taiwan airspace, major military exercises, cyber espionage, etc. – which have increased the capacity of the PLA to fight in a regional military conflict.

<SUBJECT>Research Report on Chinese Strategic Deception
<SOLNBR>USCC-003

<CONTACT>John D. Dotson, Research Coordinator, Phone 2026241482, Email jdotson@uscc.gov - Kathy Michels, Associate Director, Phone 202-624-1409, Email kmichels@uscc.gov
<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time report investigating the significance of influence operations, perception management, and intentional strategic misdirection on the part of PRC state entities within the context of Chinese foreign and security policy. The study should also examine the institutional actors and methods by which such operations are implemented. 

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	Examine the extent to which the Chinese government employs strategic-level deception in the course of its relations with the U.S. government. Address the Chinese motivations for such deceptive behavior, and address the major policy areas which would be most affected by such strategic deception.
•	Address the question of whether or not U.S. perceptions of active Chinese deception efforts could in some cases reflect an incomplete understanding of Chinese policy-making in certain areas. If this were to be the case, identify the gaps in U.S. understanding of the opaque Chinese decision-making process which need to be addressed.
•	Examine and explicate whether or not there are identifiable strains within historical Chinese political and strategic culture, or within the political culture of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which would incline Chinese decision-makers to consciously mislead U.S. leaders regarding the nature and intent of Chinese policies, and/or future Chinese courses of action.
•	Determine whether or not there might exist identifiable historical case studies involving significant U.S. decisions in the military, foreign policy, or national security decision-making realms, in which U.S. officials have been affected by intentional Chinese deception. If so, one or more of these case studies should be examined and explicated.  
•	Determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to suggest that PRC officials may have conscious intent to mislead U.S. business and political leaders regarding the ultimate intent behind purchases of dual-use technology, and/or investment in U.S. high-tech firms.
•	If identifiable deception operations exist, describe whether they appear to be piecemeal efforts by individual government entities, or whether they appear to be centrally coordinated. If centrally coordinated, identify the leading institution(s) involved in these efforts, and describe the specific means, methods and institutional actors by which the PRC government implements efforts at strategic deception.
•	Address efforts by PRC state entities to influence the perceptions and opinions of those who help to shape public policy in the government, business, academic, media, and think tank communities of the United States. Explicate perception management efforts which have been made by PRC entities, and the means by which this been accomplished – particularly, the specific methods and institutional actors which the PRC government employed in these influence operations. In such cases, examine whether or not the decisions of targeted individuals and/or institutions may have been significantly affected, and whether this might have distorted U.S. understanding of China or otherwise affected U.S. policy-making.
•	Determine whether there might be any adjustments to U.S. government policy which would be recommended in order to counter PRC strategic deception and influence operations.
•	Include, as an appendix, a summary literature review of prior relevant studies and academic articles published within the last ten years on the topics of PRC strategic deception and influence operations.

<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time report investigating the subsidies which the government of the PRC provides to both domestic and foreign firms in China, and the effects which these subsidies might have on the competitive ability of U.S. firms.

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	Examine the nature and scale of national, provincial, and local PRC government subsidies to what have been officially defined as “absolute control” and “heavyweight” industries, with particular emphasis on those companies in the manufacturing sector which could be in competition with U.S. firms. The study would seek to identify specific subsidy levels. It would also examine the extent to which these subsidies provide a competitive advantage to PRC firms.
•	The study would also note past subsidies which may have been either significantly reduced or ended, but which provided benefits to the producer or sector.
•	The study would note those subsidies which could be considered prohibited or actionable under World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.
•	The study would also examine the nature and scale of PRC government subsidies and other incentives to U.S. and Western firms which locate research and/or production facilities in China. Determine whether or not there are any identifiable patterns to these incentives, and whether or not they might reveal considerations other than local employment levels, such as longer-term ambitions to acquire foreign expertise and technology, or to create economic dependencies in certain economic sectors.

<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time report on particular “sunrise” sectors of the PRC’s science and technology (S&T) industries – i.e., sectors which have been targeted by the government of the PRC for development and subsidization, and in which the PRC could emerge as a world leader and major competitor to U.S. firms. The study would focus in particular on the state of research and development (R&D) in the electro-optics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology fields, which have all been identified as sectors in which the PRC could emerge as a serious competitor to the U.S. 

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	How advanced is the state of R&D in these fields within the PRC? And how does this compare to the state of U.S.-led efforts in these fields of technology?
•	Identify the major institutional entities involved in these sectors, and their linkages with one another. Identify as well significant linkages with U.S./Western firms, and examine whether or not technology transfer from foreign firms is facilitating the development of these technologies by PRC entities.  
•	Identify the nature and scale of the government policy support which is being provided to these “sunrise” R&D sectors. Identify as well the nature and scale of the financial subsidies which the government of the PRC is providing to these industries.
•	Assess the potential economic implications for the U.S. and U.S. businesses if PRC R&D entities surpass their U.S. counterparts in these sectors. Similarly, assess the potential military and/or national security implications for the U.S. if the PRC emerges as a leader in these fields of technology.

<DESC>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter “the Commission”) invites submission of proposals from contractors capable of providing a one-time comprehensive study of identifiable patterns in U.S.-China trade since the time of China’s accession to the WTO. In particular, the study would seek to identify any changing patterns in trade with the U.S. or other trading partners since China’s accession to the WTO, the overall effects of this trade on the U.S. economy, and to determine whether there might be any national security implications of particular concern.

Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:

•	Assess the comprehensive effects of China’s WTO accession on the U.S. economy. Assess the extent to which China’s accession to the WTO has affected the net loss/gain of jobs in the U.S., and identify the most prominent sectors in which these changes have taken place.
•	Analyze trade patterns between China and other countries and regions to determine whether there are any differences vis-à-vis U.S.-China trade patterns and, if there are, what underlies those differences.  
•	During the course of a number of food and product safety scares in 2007, numerous press reports identified a number of ingredients – such as ascorbic acid and wheat gluten – that are now extensively, if not solely sourced from China. The study would seek to identify significant commodities, industrial and consumer products which are now extensively, if not solely sourced from China, and upon which the U.S. market may now be dependent.
•	Similarly, the study would also seek to any identify products of a strategic nature – such as microchips used in advanced weapons systems, chemical components used in the manufacture of munitions, etc. – which are now extensively, if not solely sourced from China, and upon which U.S. defense contractors may now be dependent.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking a contractor for Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP): Methods for Combined Analysis of Pain and Analgesic Rescue Scores
REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.     

Requirements: 
In March of 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a white paper entitled "Innovation or Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.”   This report called for research to develop and validate new tools and methods for testing new medicines on the "critical path" from the laboratory to the patients. This initiative is called the Critical Path Initiative.

FDA’s Critical Path Initiative (CPI) seeks to identify and address scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  Under the CPI, FDA is trying to identify innovative ways to enhance drug development and reduce the time it takes to bring therapeutically important medical products to the market by leveraging prior knowledge.

Under the auspices of this initiative, FDA, in conjunction with academia launched an initiative in August 2006 called the Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP) focused on identifying scientific gaps in the design, implementation and interpretation of clinical trials of acute and chronic analgesic drug products, and on implementing projects that will bridge these gaps.  Under the ACTP, FDA and academia have initiated work to coordinate and support a series of research projects, all focused on analgesic clinical trial design and product development. Through the ACTP, FDA and academia are identifying scientific gaps in the aforementioned areas, prioritizing projects based on public health needs and implementing them through the leveraging of resources and technical expertise from multiple partners.

In spite of the enormous advances in drug development over the past two or three decades, (e.g., drugs that cure cancer, biologic drug products that halt the progression of rheumatoid arthritis), the development of novel analgesic drug products has seriously lagged behind.  Indeed, to this day, the only analgesic drug products that are used widely and successfully are opioids, acetaminophen and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), all of which have serious, potentially life-threatening toxicities even when used properly. While there has been exploration at the earliest stages of drug development, there has been wide'-spread reluctance on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to take novel products further into development. This is in no small part due to the often daunting task of demonstrating the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. Many experts in analgesic drug development believe that it is the design of the clinical trials that is - at fault in this situation, and that better trial designs will yield more successful results. This hypothesis is certainly supported by the frequent failures of clinical efficacy trials of opioid drug products, considering the well established effectiveness of these products from literally thousands of years of clinical experience.  

IV. Objective:
FDA wishes to engage contractors to provide research and assistance in developing statistical methodologies to examine the use, in peri-operative pain trials, of combined pain scores and scores of rescue medication use for comparisons of differences in effect between study treatments.

V.  Scope of Work: 
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services necessary for performance of the work as described below.  

The contractor shall specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key tasks identified.  All data and outcomes associated with this scope of work shall be provided to and go through the Project Officer (PO), to the FDA.  A final report shall be prepared by the contractor that summarizes the deliverables of this contract. 

The contractor shall identify clinical trials evaluating the analgesic effects of various treatments in patients also receiving intravenous opioid and other rescue medication during the peri-operative period.

The contractor shall, based on expert feedback and in collaboration with FDA staff, compile a list of possible statistical procedures for combined analysis of pain and analgesic rescue scores and determine which methods are best suited for analysis of the data.

The contractor shall then further evaluate the aforementioned data using the identified statistical methods, to determine which analysis methods will potentially provide evidence of treatment efficacy when it truly exists, and avoid false negative as well as false positive results. 

The contractor shall lead the development of appropriate publication/s and/or report/s, in collaboration with FDA staff on summaries and other finding from this Statement of Work, the number and content of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the contractor and the FDA Project Officer.

<DESC><p>1. I just came across your RFP for website consultancy and would love to<br />entertain your proposal; however, Lightmaker is an international company<br />that works with high-end, upscale web development site. It is asked that<br />you share with us your budget constraints so we will have a better idea if<br />this project can be pursued by us or better passed on to another of our<br />sister partners.</p>
<p>1. Answer: The estimated amount for a base and two options is $25,000.00 for the entire contract.</p>
<p>2. Does this system currently exist?</p>
<p>2. Answer: Yes</p>
<p>3. Is there an incumbent contractor?</p>
<p>3. Answer: Yes, Research Research Limited, London, England.</p>
<p>4. Are the Funding Opportunities, Sponsors, and new databases in <br />existence? Where are they stored? Can information on their size, type <br />(SQL, Oracle, etc.), structure, etc. be provided?</p>
<p>4. Answer: All of the funding opportunities are identified and posted by the existing research funding database contractor. We currently have a searchable web-based research funding database and we do not want another one developed. We are seeking offers from companies who have the product(s) immediately ready for purchase.</p>
<p>5. Is the intent for the USUHS to be able to provide opportunities for <br />others, or for those at USUHS to have a means for determining what is <br />available to them?</p>
<p>5. Answer: The intent is for those at USU to have a means for determining what is available to them.</p>
<p>6. Should we assume we, the contractor, will host the website on machines <br />at our facility? Are there technical specifications available for this <br />RFP?</p>
<p>6. Answer: Yes. The contractor does host the website.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide a list of questions received and&nbsp;answers thereto&nbsp;regarding the solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR SOLICITATION DG133C07RP0045
<p>&nbsp;1. How do we price our proposal? How do we respond technically?</p>
<p><strong>Pursuant to the B.2 of the solicitation, offerors are required to submit personnel rates for staff to be used for each of the 5 planned years of the overall requirement. Technical proposals are to describe each offeror's capabilities with respect to each of the specified areas in the SOO, keeping in mind the evaluation criteria to be used.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regarding individual tasks, as stated in the solicitation, offerors may submit proposals for as many tasks as it chooses. Offerors are not required to submit proposals for any tasks. However, this may have an effect on whether or not the offeror is selected to receive a contract. Separate technical and price proposals shall be submitted for each task. Prices shall be based on the schedule of rates submitted for the overall contract proposal.</strong></p>
<p>2. The solicitation states that the contractor will be required to provide <br />batteries as part of PORTS O&amp;M duties, which is a departure from typical <br />past practices when NOAA provided batteries on an as-needed basis. Please <br />advise if NOAA will approximate the number of batteries required, or if the <br />contractor should include this in the cost estimate along with a contingency <br />for damage/power failures.</p>
<p><strong>Approximately each water level station and each current meter station has three 40 AH gel-cell batteries. Occasionally a station will have a fourth battery to power auxiliary components. Batteries are required to be routinely replaced every two years or as need in case of a failure. </strong></p>
<p>3. The solicitation states that the contractor is required to provide <br />stainless steel rods for new BM installations. Please advise if the <br />contractor should include an estimate of the number of rods required, or if <br />NOAA will provide a specification.</p>
<p><strong>This is a difficult requirement to specify because the exact number of BM rods is an unknown. Would suggest that the vendor quote this on a materials cost basis once the number of rods is determined along with the connectors, grease sleeves, grease, driving points and 5 inch protective PVC pipes and concrete. The aluminum logo access covers and witness posts will be GFE along with any bronze surface bench marks.</strong></p>
<p>4.. For Delaware PORTS, the solicitation discusses cleaning of the DAS/IDS <br />systems in section 4.2.3.5. Table 1 states yearly service, but section <br />4.2.3.5.b.5) requires monthly service. Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>The requirement should be yearly.</strong></p>
<p>5. For Delaware PORTS, the radio base station inspections are yearly <br />according to Table 1 in section 4.2.3.5, but at 6-month intervals in section <br />4.2.3.5.d.3). Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>The requirement should be yearly and replace batteries every two years. </strong></p>
<p>6. In section 7.1 of the Delaware PORTS task description, the Philadelphia <br />current meter is listed as a bottom-mounted current meter. Currently, it is <br />a horizontally mounted current meter. Please advise if there are plans to <br />change this to a bottom mounted current meter.</p>
<p><strong>There are no plans to change this current meter to a bottom mount at this time. </strong></p>
<p>7. For Delaware PORTS, the current meter that used to be at Newbold is not <br />listed in the Appendix A table. Please advise if this current meter station <br />is being terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Current Meter is terminated at this time.</strong></p>
<p>8. Page 42 of the Statement of Objectives states that, "The contractor will <br />be responsible for providing and installing the SL-ADCP mount,..." However, item 6 under Current Meter Stations on page F-1 for the Lake Charles PORTS task description states that the Horizontal Current Profiler I-beam mount <br />and clamps are included in the GFE. Please clarify.</p>
<p><strong>The "I" beam, sled, top mount, winch and box are GFE. The vendor shall be responsible for the clamps that secure the mount to the bulkhead or pile.</strong></p>
<p>9. Item E.2 on page 10 of the Solicitation states that inspection and <br />acceptance of supplies and services to be provided under this contract will <br />be performed at the NOAA offices in Silver Spring. Please advise if any <br />such inspections for the five (5) tasks included in the solicitation package <br />are required in Silver Spring.</p>
<p><strong>CO-OPS Task Managers will generally inspect all new sensor installations. Task Managers may be on site during any contractor field operation. Contract deliverables such as documentation is reviewed in Silver Spring as well as in CO-OPS field offices.</strong></p>
<p>10. Factors B and C in the Section M.2 Evaluation Criteria refer to <br />contacting references for past work. Please advise if the offeror can <br />identify individuals within NOAA, including CO-OPS personnel, as references for past work. If yes, please also outline any restrictions or procedures <br />the offeror should recognize to ensure the NOAA personnel identified as <br />references are eligible.</p>
<p><strong>Listing NOAA personnel as references may be done at your own discretion</strong>.</p>
<p>11. Page 32 of the Solicitation states, "If an offeror expects to compete <br />for future task orders in specific functional areas (i.e., PORTS, currents, <br />water levels, etc.), it should respond to corresponding tasks as part of <br />this solicitation." Please advise if this indicates that an offeror is <br />ineligible to respond to future similar tasks unless task order proposals <br />are offered as part of its response to this solicitation. For instance, if <br />an offeror fails to submit a proposal for the Task 08-04 FL East Coast <br />Currents, is the offeror ineligible to propose on future current meter <br />deployment projects? Likewise, does an offeror need to respond to one of <br />the PORTS tasks (e.g., Delaware, NY, or Lake Charles) in order to be <br />eligible to respond to future PORTS tasks?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p><br />12. After reviewing the PORT-Lake Charles spec, a vendor did not see whether a nitrogen purge system is implemented on the measurement station. Since the document states that over 50% use these systems, the vendor wanted to verify that nitrogen supplies will not be required.</p>
<p><strong>This installation will include a pump gas purge system. Nitrogen tanks will not be required.<br /></strong></p>
<p>13. Task 08-04. Florida East Coast. We understand that the contractor has responsibility transit and insurance of GFE from Chesapeake to the storage facility and return. Is the contractor also responsible for insuring loss or damage to GFE while deployed in the water?</p>
<p><strong>No.<br /></strong></p>
<p>14. Task 08-02. Lake Charles Ports. Section 7 task pricing. This does not request prices for training/kick off meeting in Chesapeake/Silver Springs (sic). We intend to include this pricing, unless you advise otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>Price should be included and broken out for the kickoff meeting.<br /></strong></p>
<p>15. Same task as above. Section 4.1.3.1a. We assume the associated cable; flex conduit and securing hardware and NEMA4X aluminum enclosure will provide by contractor. Can you please confirm our understanding is correct?</p>
<p><strong>CO-OPS provides the enclosure and the enclosure stand as per the contract. For Lake Charles there are special clamps for each of the locations that CO-OPS will provide. CO-OPS provides the aluminum poles, clamps, and hardware for mounting the solar panels on the side of the enclosure as well.</strong></p>

This should include, but not be limited to, obtaining an understanding of the components of internal control, assessing the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures components of the financial statements, and performing tests of the Department?s internal controls.  
o	Review information system general and application controls in the Department?s applications that are significant to the financial statements to the extent necessary to (1) conclude whether general controls are properly designed and operating effectively, (2) consider application controls as part of the internal control assessment in the financial statement audit, and (3) support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) assessment. 
?	Obtain an understanding of the process by which the agency identifies and evaluates weaknesses required to be reported under the Federal Managers? Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and related agency implementing procedures.  Compare material weaknesses disclosed during the audit with those material weaknesses reported in the agency's FMFIA report that relate to the financial statements.  If material weaknesses were disclosed during the audit that were not reported in the Department?s FMFIA report, auditor will determine whether the failure to detect and report material weaknesses constitutes a significant deficiency or material weakness in the entity?s internal control.  In order to address this objective, auditor should obtain information on the Department?s efforts to implement OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A.
?	Perform tests of compliance with laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the Department?s FY 2009 financial statements, including FFMIA.
?	For allocation transfers, coordinate early with ?child? agencies to ensure that adequate audit coverage will be provided.  
?	Determine whether the special-purpose financial statements and accompanying notes present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, net costs and changes in net position, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the presentation requirements set forth in the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Chapter 4700.
?	Obtain an understanding of internal control over the financial reporting process for the special-purpose financial statements and perform tests of those controls.  
?	Perform tests of compliance with TFM Chapter 4700.  
?	Assess the reasonableness of FY 2009 retirement, health, and life insurance withholdings/contributions, and employee headcount information provided to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required by OMB Bulletin 07-04.  Comply with any additional guidance issued by either OPM or OMB during FY 2009.

<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current ‘state of the art’ both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHS’s return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Department’s enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHS’s two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHS’s geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Department’s Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

•‘Ad hoc’ street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

•Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

•Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. ‘Gazetteer’ level functionality)

•Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc…)

•Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

•Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

•Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
•Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
•Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
•U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
•National Operations Center (NOC)
•U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

•The estimated monthly volume of ‘ad hoc’ geocoding requests………. ….   500,000
•The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests……………... 1,000,000
•The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests……. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

•Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
•Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
•Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
•Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

2. RESPONSE GUIDELINES & REQUIRED FORMAT

2.1 RESPONSE GUIDELINES

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

• Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

• ‘Gazetteer’ Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

• Exact/Partial Street Address
• City/Neighborhood/County Name
• Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc…)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential ‘call center’ application and provide a flexible ‘gazetteer’ level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

• ‘Ad-hoc’ Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ‘ad hoc’ or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed ‘plug-ins’, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

• ‘Geo’-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure the services of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the 8th Floor Renovation for the U.S. Veterans Affairs at the Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, VA.  It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open Competition utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interests of the Government.  The NAICS for this procurement is code 236220.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.
The work includes but is not limited to a complete renovation of approximately 15,075 square feet of interior space located on the 8th Floor of the Poff Federal Building Roanoke, Virginia.  The renovation will involve complete demolition of the existing space with installation of all new Division 9 finishes. Scope of work will included miscellaneous metals, millwork, doors, glass & glazing, gypsum wallboard & metal studs, acoustical ceiling, resilient flooring & base, carpet, painting & wall covering, interior graphic signage package, projection screens, supply ductwork with diffusers, reconfigured sprinkler system and finally complete new electrical & lighting system.  The estimate dollar value for the procurement is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection process.  As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the RFP. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability;  1) Firm lists a minimum of three (3) projects completed in the past five (5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total construction value of at least comparable dollar size. These shall be projects in which the offeror performed duties as the general contractor. Projects performed with a subcontractor who acted in a teaming capacity to assist with general contractor duties shall also be considered acceptable.  2) Management and Key Personnel Qualifications - offerors will be requested to identify the Project Manager and the Superintendent for the proposed project.  During construction, the position of Project Manager and Superintendent cannot deviate from that individual contained in the proposal, without approval by GSA.  The Project Manager and Superintendent must have at least five (5) years of similar experience in occupied facilities.  The resume should state the length of years experience with the current firm.  It needs to include professional qualifications; specialized experience in this type of work and the technical competence on similar projects.  A complete project list of similar project experience for the Project Manager and the Superintendent shall be requested to demonstrate that they meet the minimum experience level.

<DESC>The above description is being revisd to the following:  The Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO) is seeking a light weight replacement for the current heavy steel Ballistic Protection System (BPS) currently used on its rotary wing aircraft.  As a result TAPO has the requirement to conduct a live fire test on readily available aircraft armor panels (ballistic protection).  These systems should encompass the gamut of light weight ballistic protection to meet the objective and threshold requirements below.  Those firms who would like to participate in these live fire tests are invited to provide two 1’ x 1’ (one-foot-square) panels at no cost to the government for the government’s use in the test.  Ballistic performance tests will be carried out using the following criteria: • Range/ Obliquity – Threshhold – 300 meters, Objective - 100 meters from muzzle stand-off and zero obliquity (100m, 0 Deg); • Ballistic Protection - Threshold - 7.62mm x 39 M1943 Type PS ball, Objective – 5.45mm x 39 Full Metal Jacket Type PS 7.62mm x 54R Type LPS and • Repeatability – Threshhold – 2 Rounds within a 3” diameter, Objective - 2 rounds within a 1” diameter.  The armor should be in its deployable state (i.e. have any and all coatings typically used when in normal operation in a combat environment) and at an Areal weight with a Mass Efficiency (ME) of 3 or greater, as compared to RHA.   Mark your panels with appropriate markings to reflect supplier, type of material, and armor fabrication.  Firms will only be provided the results from their own ballistic panel test event and will not have access to another firm’s result.  This is a Government only test event and participating firms cannot witness the test.  Additionally the Government requests the written composition of the armor panel to determine if any material or environmental concerns exist.  These details will be maintained by the Government and will not be shared with other firms.  The Government conducted live fire test is anticipated to occur in early July 08.  As a result each firm’s panels must be delivered no later than 30 June 08.  TAPO Technical POC for this action is Sean Heatherman, Aerospace Engineer, (757) 878-3299 ext 266.
