<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has been charged to lead the nation in utilizing existing and emerging information technology (IT) to meet national priorities that reflect the country's broad based social, economic, and political values and goals. Its extended charge continues under the Federal Information Security Management Act to develop cyber security standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques. Revised OMB CircularA-119 establishes policies on Federal use and development of voluntary consensus standards and on conformity assessment activities.</p>
<p>Public Law 104-113, the "National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995," codified existing policies in A-119, established reporting requirements, and authorized NIST to coordinate conformity assessment activities of the agencies. In order to ensure that the USG has a source of technically sound, consensus international biometric standards to meet the USG's priority needs for biometric-based recognition of individuals, NIST championed the formation of ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37, Biometrics. NIST determined the best method for ensuring first-rate secretariat services for SC 37 was to contract for such services. These SC 37 secretariat services are for the direct benefit of NIST and the USG, ensuring the rapid development of critically needed voluntary consensus biometric standards developed in an environment that offers openness and due process as required by OMB CircularA-119.</p>
<p>By providing these services, NIST ITL supports the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy/National Science and Technology Council's goals as delineated under its Policy for Enabling the Development, Adoption and Use of Biometric Standards, which is to enable biometric system interoperability and support Federal agency biometrics needs. This policy states that "Continued development of voluntary consensus standards for biometrics is vital to the security of our Nation and the stability of the US-based biometrics community."</p>
<p>NIST is contemplating a procurement to acquire Secretariat services for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) / International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) Joint Technical Committee 1 on Information Technology, Subcommittee 37 on Biometrics (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC37) and SC 37 Working Group 4 on Biometric Functional Architecture and Related Profiles (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC37 WG 4.<br />.<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541990, as those domestic sources having annual receipts of $14.0 million or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>To complete the contemplated services, potential offerors must have knowledge, expertise and experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>(a)Knowledge of current policies and procedures for the work of ISO/IEC, ISO/IEC JTC 1, and JTC 1/SC 37 including expert knowledge of the ISO/IEC Directives Part 1, the Procedures for technical work of ISO/IEC; its Supplement, Procedures specific to JTC 1; and current versions of the JTC 1 and ISO/IEC JTC SC 37 Standing documents;</p>
<p>(b) Administration of the SC 37 and SC 37 WG 4 program of work according to those procedures and Standing documents; and the drafting of comprehensive SC 37 and SC 37 WG 4 meeting recommendations/resolutions during each meeting for approval by the membership; <br />(c) Interaction in a positive and efficient manner with the SC 37 Officers and members as well as ISO/IEC Management Boards and JTC 1.</p>
<p>Companies that maintain any or all of the capabilities above are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The report must include clear and concise documentation of the Contractor's knowledge, expertise and experience in areas a through c identified above, and any other information relevant to your capabilities. Also, the following information must be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name and business size of the company;</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies), including potential subcontractors, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address);</p>
<p>3. Do the required labor categories exist under one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. E-mail address: CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than 3:00 PM local time on May 11, 2012.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, VA Maine Healthcare System

Contracting, VA Maine Healthcare System.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  One-time Sole Source Firm Fixed Price purchase order for the acquisition of equipment from American Medical Depot to handle surgical waste disposal
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Operating Room (OR) currently disposes of 13,885 pound of surgical irrigation fluid a year.  With the purchase of the Neptune Waste Management System, the staff will be able to dispose of the fluid more safely and efficiently.  The Neptune eliminates the splash risk from disposing contaminated fluid down the hopper and changing suction canisters.   The Neptune is on wheels and is far ergonomically superior to our current methods of fluid waste disposal minimizing the risk of injury from carrying heavy container fluid.  There is a decreased risk to housekeeping workers who will no longer have to handle heavy biohazard fluid waste from the Operating Room.  Neptune offers superior digital readout for fluid collection giving the OR and Anesthesia staff a better indication of operative blood loss.  Neptune offers emergency back-up suction ability in the event of a facility loss of vacuum because Neptune functions on electricity. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The Neptune has a dedicated service team available to address any issues or concerns regarding the product.   There are over 15,000 total rovers in the United States, with 86% market share in the Cart Based Waste Management Systems.  Over 38 of the top orthopedic hospitals use the Neptune Rover System.   The Neptune is a totally closed system.  There are no lids to take off the collection canisters and they are completely enclosed with the frame of the system.  The advantages to this feature are primarily infection control related.   The Neptune 2 has two independent suction control levels.  All other similar products on the market have one vacuum source, which does not allow for versatility during a single surgery.  The advantage to this feature is that the surgeon/anesthesiologist can choose to use a high or low suction level at the same time.  The Neptune 2 is able to separate two fluid types, once being blood and the other being irrigation.  The advantage to this feature is that if these fluid types mix together, it is difficult to determine the amount of blood loss during the surgery.   The feature allows more accuracy in making this determination.  The Neptune 2 includes a power IV pole, which holds four bags of saline at once.  The advantages to this feature are that there is no manual lifting of the saline bags, and there is no separate IV pole.  This leads to less manual labor for the nurses and less poles in the operating room, which already has limited space.  The Neptune 2 includes a smoke evacuation unit with an ultra low penetrating air filter (ULPA), which helps suction away smoke created when cauterizing tissue during surgery.   Advantage to this feature is that it is included within the frame of the system saving valuable OR space and does not require separate purchase of equipment.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A Sources Sought Notice was issued on FedBizOps on 1/19/2012 and no responses were received.  Approximately 36% of the VA Medical Centers are using the Neptune Waste Management System.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   Pricing is deemed fair and reasonable as it is the same pricing offered to American Medical Depot's other commercial customers in the marketplace.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Based on prior market research VISN 1 Contracting has documentation that American Medical Depot is the sole source for Stryker products.  The Neptune waste management system is manufactured by Stryker.  Based upon the use of product by 36% of the VA's, and satisfaction of the facilities, the request is submitted.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Please refer to Section 8 above.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  none - Sources Sought Notice was issued on FedBizOps 1/19/2012 with no responses

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The Government will continue to conduct market research for each requirement received to locate alternative products.  However, until Stryker allows other companies to sell their equipment/supplies, all Stryker equipment will have to continue to be purchased from American Medical Depot on a Sole Source basis.
