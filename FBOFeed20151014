<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p>The US Army Contracting Command is exploring options to support requirements to provide persistent surveillance for Force Protection (FP) at various Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations. The FP equipment must operate continuously on a 24/7 basis, in a very wide range of environmental conditions, including rain, dust, wind, and in temperatures from below freezing to extreme heat to support the safety of our troops and allies at forward deployed locations. While the individual requirements for a given Forward Operating Base (FOB) may vary, our intent is to utilize stabilized Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors mounted on towers integrated with a ground control station solution and associated communications equipment as the primary FP solution. While the overall FP requirement remains constant for all locations, the specific EO/IR solution will vary depending upon specific range requirements. As such, we have a requirement to ensure the tower, ground control station, wiring, mounting interfaces, user interface, etc. remain constant and then selecting the correct EO/IR sensor based upon the specific requirements for range, weight, power &amp; cost.</p>
<p>Therefore, our requirement is for two EO/IR sensors that are completely interchangeable from a hardware and software integration standpoint with the tower. This includes a long range, single LRU EO/IR sensor and a shorter range, lighter weight, less costly single LRU EO/IR sensor. The long range EO/IR sensor must have demonstrated performance in a 24/7 extreme temperature environment. It must be less than 15" in diameter and no taller than 18.5". The turret weight must be less than 100 lbs. The power requirement must be less than 350W (average) with a maximum of 400W. The high-definition (HD) mid-wave IR (MWIR) sensor must have a minimum of a 1280x720 pixels in the focal plane array (FPA) with 40o, 6.9o, 1.3o, 0.65o and 0.36o fields of view (FOVs). The HD EO sensor must be a 1920x1080 pixel FPA capable of operating at 29.7Hz or 25.0 Hz with 4.54 um resolution. The HD EO will have 29.9o, 4.83o, 0.92o, 0.51o and 0.25o FOVs. The sensor must have a 640 x 480 pixel Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) sensor with 28.6o, 4.61o, 0.88o, 0.49o and 0.24o FOVs. The sensor must offer the option to include a SWIR Laser Illuminator (LI). The sensor must include a 150mW Laser Pointer (LP) and an eye safe Laser Range Finder (LRF) with a 25km range, better than 5 meter resolution and capable of operating at 1-6 Hz continuously and at 10 Hz in a burst mode. The sensor must also have a video tracker, provide image blending, MISP compliant STD 0601 metadata, inertial Navigation units, GPS receivers, and common cables.</p>
<p>The SWAP EO/IR sensor must also have demonstrated performance in a 24/7 extreme environment. It must be less than 15" in diameter and no taller than 14". The turret weight must be less than 65 lbs. The power requirement must be less than 250W (average) with a maximum of 400W. The reduced range EO/IR sensor must also be able to rotate at 1 rad/sec or greater and the stability must be less than 10 micro radians. The HD MWIR sensor must have a minimum of a 1280x720 pixels in the FPA and continuous zoom from 40o to 2o and down to 1o with electronic zoom. The HD EO sensor must contain 1920x1080 pixels in the FPA capable of operating at 29.7Hz or 25.0 Hz with 3.69 um resolution. The HD EO will have continuous zoom from 45.3o to 2.38o, down to 1.19o with electronic zoom. The sensor must have a 640 x 480 pixel SWIR with multi-FOVs of 32.8o 5.32o, 1.01o and 0.56o. The sensor must offer the option to include a 1.5W Laser Illuminator. The sensor must include a 150 mW LP and an eye safe LRF with a 25km range, better than 5 meter resolution and capable of operating at 1-6 Hz continuously and at 10 Hz in a burst mode. The reduced range sensor must also have a video tracker, provide image blending, MISP compliant STD 0601 metadata, inertial Navigation units, GPS receivers, and common cables.</p>
<p>Both the long range EO/IR sensor and the reduced SWAP EO/IR sensor must support HD-SDI, RS422 and Ethernet interfaces. Both sensors must use the same mounting hardware/interface and software interfaces and utilize the same cables so no other changes will be required when switching between the long range and reduced SWAP EO/IR sensor types on the tower. Both sensors must also provide active, self-contained cooling to ensure 24/7 operation in extreme heat environments where there is little or no airflow.</p>
<p><br />ACC is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>1. What is your company's past experience in building High Definition EO/IR sensors?</p>
<p>2. What is the experience level of your personnel with respect to High Definition EO/IR sensors?</p>
<p><br />3. How many and what type of EO/IR sensors for force protection is your company currently supporting in the field?</p>
<p>4. Does your company produce High Definition EO/IR sensors for military systems?</p>
<p><br />5. Does your company produce or have a capability to produce most or all of the subassemblies and components required for these High Definition EO/IR sensors, or is your expertise primarily as a system integrator.<br /><br />6. What is your estimated development schedule for a quantity of 25 each of <br />these High Definition EO/IR sensors?</p>
<p>Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the cost estimates provided as a result of this request are "best" estimates only.</p>
<p>The response date for this market research is October 21, 2015. No calls will be accepted.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This solicitation is being issued as an unrestricted RFP. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

The primary NAICS Code for this procurement is 561210 and the annual small business size standard is $38.5M dollars. 


This acquisition is for BOS services at Naval Support Activity, New Orleans, LA, the Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base, New Orleans, LA, Naval Operational Support Center Shreveport, and SPAWARSYCENTLANT New Orleans.

Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.


The work will include all labor, management, supervision, tools, material, and equipment required to perform refuse collection and disposal in the South Texas area.  This requirement is performance based.  


Market research was performed in accordance with FAR 10.002(b)(2).
  As a result of the market research, the Contracting Officer recommended soliciting as 100% small business set-aside.  The NAVFAC Southeast small business office concurs with the set-aside determination.  As a result, the proposed Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as 100% small business set-aside.  


The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose total price and technical proposal offers the best value to the Government.

This emulator will be used to replicate the dual workstation OHIO Class Exterior C  and  M Software System (ECSS) I1V1, I1V2 and I1V3 configuration on a Ship Submersible Ballistic Nuclear/Ship Submersible Guided Nuclear (SSBN/SSGN) Common Submarine Radio Room.
 The configuration will be able to be selected at system startup via a front end laptop configured as the controlling unit.  The emulator will allow technicians to simulate radio room equipment problems (similar to a simulator), allowing the technicians to familiarize themselves with the system without being onboard the submarine, and to be able to potentially recommend software changes/workarounds aboard submarines.

<RESPDATE>110215
<ARCHDATE>02012016
<CONTACT>Young, Gerold
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to rebuild and upgrade two (2) Horiba LDV dynamometers, replace existing dynamometer drives with two (2) new 150kW drives and replace the existing 4WD dynamometer controller.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a small business size of 500 employees.

The EPA is mandated to measure fuel economy and emissions.  These measurements are conducted on dynamometers that simulate road loads.  The current Horiba LDV dynamometers, existing associated drives, and the RealTime dynamometer controller are past their useful life, prone to failure, and increasingly difficult to maintain due to the unavailability of replacement parts.  

The contractor will rebuild both Horiba LDV dynamometers with upgraded heated bearings.  The contractor will electrically disconnect and remove both of the Horiba LDV dynamometers from their pits and transport them to their facility for the rebuild.  The rolls, controls, rod ends and brakes will be removed and re-installed upon re-installation of the dynamometer.  The contractor will integrate the newly rebuilt dynamometers into the new 4WD dynamometer controller in Test Cell 514 detailed below.  

The current dynamometer drives are under-sized and prone to failure.  The contractor will replace the current drives with new dynamometer drives which can continuously absorb 300 kW on both the front and rear dynamometer simultaneously with a peak absorption of 420 kW.  The dynamometer controller will control the two newly rebuilt Horiba LDV dynamometers and new drives in NVFEL Cell 514.  

The new dynamometer controller will need to be a complete stand-alone system and will need to be contained within a single stand-alone cabinet containing all the components required to run the system.  

The full Statement of Work, which will be included in the solicitation, describes and sets forth the total system responsibility, which shall include integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, warranty, and training of EPA staff.
		
Award will be made on a Best Value Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant previous experience.  The full solicitation should be issued on or about November 2, 2015 on FedConnect.net.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal on FedConnect.net which shall be considered by the Agency.   Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2660, or by email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-DC-16-00007
<RESPDATE>102315
<ARCHDATE>02292016
<CONTACT>Martin, Jeffrey
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division, hereby gives notice of its intent to solicit from a single source, pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), from the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA).  SWANA will provide EPA conference support services, to include the following activities: facility space and set-up, audio visual equipment, meeting planning logistics and speaker management, registration logistical services and customer service, and advertising and outreach.

SWANA is holding its 39th Annual Landfill Gas (LFG) and Biogas Symposium (SWANA LFG Symposium) from April 4-7, 2016 in Charleston, South Carolina. EPAs Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) intends to hold its LMOP National Landfill Gas Energy Gas Workshop (LMOP Workshop) on the last day (April 7, 2016) of the SWANA event. SWANA LFG Symposium is the only national-level event that provides the LFG and LFG energy industry with objective, up-to-date information about all areas of methane emissions from landfills and LFG energy, and that responds to LMOPs need for collaboration and coordination with industry organizations and local/state/federal government representatives.  The SWANA conference is the only conference that meets the EPAs requirements, as there are no other trade associations that have the appropriate content, focus, and stakeholders to align with EPAs LMOP. 

This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing.  Capability statements and associated pricing must be received before 4:30pm (Eastern Time) on 23 October 2015. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred for preparing a response to this notice.  The determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

The point of contact for this notice is Jeffrey Martin, Contracting Officer.  Responses shall be submitted to Jeffrey Martin, martin.jeffrey@epa.gov by the due date above.

<SUBJECT>HHS OCIO IT Support
<SOLNBR>OS165420
<RESPDATE>102915
<CONTACT>Danielle Pena, Phone 3014435148, Email danielle.pena@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Health and Human Services intends to perform the following contract actions:
<p>1. Modify Lockheed Martin contract HHSP23320095401JI to increase the scope of work using the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This acquisition is in support of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) information technology support, products and services. Currently, the HHS Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides IT support to the Office of the Security and its associated Staff Divisions and Operating Divisions. This support provides the full gamut to its customer base including managed desktop support in which a "seat" includes the computing device, ancillary equipment, and services support. This model is delivered as a contractor-owned, contractor operated (COCO) managed desktop services contract that projects the life of a computing device over four (4) years. The model does not allow HHS OCIO to respond quickly to security mandates such as: operating system changes, vulnerability management, and more stringent security postures. The recent CyberSprint activities that came as a result of security breaches across the Federal enterprise created a mandate to restrict remote access to network resources using personally owned devices and weak authentication methodologies. HHS OCIO in response to the changing threat landscape developed a strategy to address the inherent security gaps in remote access from both an endpoint and authentication perspective. That strategy includes moving to a government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) model for managed desktop acquisition and support. This GOCO model was not included in the original scope of the competitively awarded IDIQ contract; therefore, PSC intends to modify the existing IDIQ contract and task order to add the GOCO model. This acquisition model will allow HHS OCIO to expeditiously field government furnished equipment (GFE) to the segment workforce currently connecting to HHS network resources via personally owned equipment. The GOCO model enables the imaging, testing and burn-in to occur at the manufacturer's site thereby delivering a secure product to the end user. From an authentication perspective, the GFE represents the furtherance of HHS OCIO's success in PIV deployment. By mandating and providing GFE computers to all staff requiring access to network resources remotely, HHS OCIO, in essence, mandates PIV usage and two-factor authentication. As a result of the aforementioned security considerations, the Government has a requirement to provide Government owned equipment to its customers. Lockheed Martin is currently providing the COCO services on the existing task order (HHSP23320095401JI/HHSP23337001T) hence the need for a modification to the task order to include the GOCO services to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. <br /><br />The period of performance for the GOCO support model is award of the modification through September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541513 and the size standard is $27.5M. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may submit a written response via email to Danielle Pe&ntilde;a at the email address below by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on October 29, 2015. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information received will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the modification of the Lockheed Martin IDIQ contract and task order to include GOCO requirements. No phones calls will be accepted. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Danielle Pe&ntilde;a at danielle.pena@psc.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)<br />FA8601-16-R-0005
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing instruments, supplies, and reagents using NAAT technology for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea detection in various types of specimens for the 711th Human Performance Wing (HPW) and USAF School of Aerospace Medicine at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in accordance with the requirements of industry standards, and applicable local, state, and Federal laws. This requirement is a follow-on effort to an existing requirement under contract FA8601-12-D-0012, which ends on 30 May 2016. A Draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The Draft SOW has all of the information listed in regards to the technical requirements for this project. As a reminder, these are drafts and estimates which are subject to be changed.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 325413 - In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500 employees. The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates an acquisition for a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one base year and four option years.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.<br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below. Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice. Failure to provide a complete response may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>

Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention All potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>

<p>1. Name of country where the test kits and reagents are manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide.

Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.<br />6. Describe your standard warranty and return process for goods and services furnished to the government for items similar in nature to this requirement.</p>

<DESC>Location and Azimuth Determining System Technologies In Support of Field Artillery Platforms
<p>Purpose: The Army Contracting Command (ACC) New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey on behalf of the Joint Program Manager Office Towed Artillery Systems (JPMO-TAS) and Research Development and Engineering Command - Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) to identify, through demonstration, technology currently available to replace the Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System with Global Positioning System (IPADS-G) and the Gun Laying and Position System (GLPS).</p>
<p>Description: This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of JPMO-TAS or RDECOM-ARDEC. The purpose of the legacy IPADS-G system is to provide accurate survey data to the war fighter at the unit level. The primary intent is to support howitzer fire missions by obtaining accurate Survey Control Points (SCPs) and to lay azimuths for indirect fire. In doing so, the IPADS-G provides a common grid at the accuracies required to support indirect fire missions. The legacy GLPS is used by cannon batteries to lay howitzers in the absence of IPADS-G supplied SCPs and reference azimuths. The intent of this Sources Sought is to identify qualified vendors that have available technology capable of providing the performance of the current IPADS-G and GLPS combined, in a smaller form factor. Upgradeability to meet future emerging requirements is necessary. For each available technology, interested vendors are requested to provide a white paper summarizing the following elements of their proposed design. Selected vendors may be invited to present their technology for demonstration at Fort Sill, Oklahoma on or around April 2016.</p>
<p>a. Design Description. All interested vendors are requested to provide a brief description of their design, including a list of the major design elements, a description of how they are integrated, and an explanation of how those elements function together to meet the technical requirements listed below.</p>
<p>b. Technical Requirements. All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of their proposed design against the following technical requirements and demonstrate the capability during demonstration if invited.</p>
<p>-Functionality. The system should be capable of providing the functionality of the IPADS-G and GLPS in a single package. Operational tasks to be accomplished by the system are listed at paragraph c below. A manual (unpowered mode) providing aiming circle functionality is also desired.</p>
<p>-Location and Orientation. The system should be capable of providing horizontal location to an accuracy of no less than 4 meters Circular Error Probable (CEP). Azimuth should be accurate to no less than 0.4 mils Probable Error (PE).</p>
<p>-Physical Characteristics. The complete system configured for dismounted use (including any required batteries, cables and/or associated hardware) should have a maximum combined weight of no greater than 40 pounds. The system should be man portable and operable by the 5th through 95th percentile soldier.</p>
<p>-Initialization. The system should be capable of initializing and providing data to the required accuracy without the aid of GPS. It is desired that the system be able to initialize without the aid of a Survey Control Point (SCP).</p>
<p>-Transportability. The system should be capable of being employable and transportable in a wide range of ground and air platforms. The system should be capable of being configured for simple and rapid exchange between supporting platforms without permanent modification to the platform or itself.</p>
<p>-Power Requirements. The system should be capable of using the host platform's electrical power (MIL-STD-1275, 24 volt) to operate and or recharge its batteries. The system should possess an internal battery to power the system when not powered by the host platform for a minimum of 6 hours operation in the basic climatic type. This internal battery should be chargeable by the host platform during operation.</p>
<p>c. Operational description. All interested vendors are requested to provide a description of the concept of operations for their device to accomplish the following operational tasks:</p>
<p>-Establishment of battery center and OS/EOL in support of battery operations<br />-Laying of a platoon to conduct optical fire control operations<br />-Verification of weapon boresight as a part of Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS)<br />-Establishment of survey control points (SCPs)<br />-Establishment of declination stations</p>
<p>If invited to the demonstration, vendors will be requested to operate their system to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>d. GPS M-Code compliance. The system architecture should use GPS signals for aiding only (e.g. GPS aided inertial). All interested vendors are to provide a description of their design's ability to implement GPS-M code requirements. It requested that vendors describe the impact if any of a GFE M-code receiver (assume GB-GRAM replacement or like) on their design and its ability to meet the technical requirements stated in this sources sought. An estimate of potential system accuracy utilizing M-Code GPS aiding is requested.</p>
<p>e. Cost. All interested vendors are requested to provide a Rough Order Magnitude of the projected costs of their design in the following areas:</p>
<p>-Non Recurring Engineering and Qualification<br />-Unit Production Cost for quantities of 1 to 100, 100 to 200 and 200 to 300 units.</p>
<p>Systems will be selected to participate in a Government hosted demonstration of their technological solutions on or about April 2016 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma based on their ability to meet the requirements stated above. The prototype of the proposed system will be assessed by the Government as part of the demonstration. The assessment is not a Government source selection evaluation or qualification effort, and any such effort by the Government to validate, approve, evaluate or select a vendor for LADS will be accomplished by a formal solicitation. Vendors are requested to present further information on the incremental and future capabilities of their prototype evaluation system during the demonstration. However, continuation of this effort past the initial Sources Sought and demonstration is discretionary and the Government is under no obligation to issue a follow-on Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Submissions of designs that are not fully compliant with all requirements are also encouraged so that JPMO-TAS and RDECOM-ARDEC may assess the capabilities of all currently available technologies. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted/proprietary. It is requested that all documents submitted be at the Unclassified level. As a result of this Sources Sought a Request For Proposal (RFP) may be issued to develop a fully compliant system. A full specification will be released if and when there is follow on procurement activity. Participation in this sources sought or the demonstration is not required to participate in a potential RFP. All interested sources are encouraged to submit their abilities/capabilities no later than 30 November 2015 to: Tara Elms Henderson ACC-NJ-JA Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; email: tara.e.henderson2.civ@mail.mil. Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact, brochures/literature, etc., and any prior performance relating to this equipment. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Electronic submittals are preferred.</p>

<DESC>M1020 120mm Mortar Ignition Cartridges
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) that are capable of manufacturing and delivering the 120mm M1020 Mortar Ignition Cartridge. The purpose of this market survey is to obtain current information on the capability of potential sources to provide this Energetics production requirement to the Army in the FY18-FY22 timeframe. The United States Government (USG) estimates that approximately 1,426,000 M1020 120mm Mortar Ignition Cartridges will be purchased under a five year Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract.</p>
<p>The following item description describes the M1020 in sufficient detail to respond to this sources sought.</p>
<p>The M1020 120mm Mortar Ignition Cartridge is used in production of the following 120mm Mortar Cartridges: M934A1 High Explosive (HE), M934E1 HE Insensitive Munition (IM), M929 Smoke White Phosphorous (WP) Multi-Optional Fuze (MOF), M933A1 HE, XM929 Smoke WP Point Detonating (PD), M930 Visible Light (VL) Illumination (ILLUM), M983 Infrared (IR) ILLUM, and M931 Full Range Practice Cartridge (FRPC). M1020 ignition cartridges are loaded with black powder, ball powder propellant, and nitrocellulose (a sub-ingredient of Ball Powder). The M1020 120mm Mortar Ignition Cartridge is inserted and secured into the hollow portion of the fin assembly. The ignition cartridge is the mechanism by which the propelling charges are initiated and when dropped into the firing tube, the ignition cartridge strikes the firing pin to initiate the primer. The ignition train travels up the ignition cartridge and flashes through holes in the fin assembly to ignite the propelling charge. The M1020 Mortar Ignition Cartridges are part of the final assembly of 120mm HE, HE IM, smoke, illuminating, and full range practice cartridges. All facilities must have safety clearance to handle hazard classifications 1.3G.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience and capability, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Energetics and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these Energetics at a high rate of production. This may include an indication of <br />willingness to invest in setting up a required production line.</p>
<p>To be considered a capable source for this effort, all interested parties must submit the requested information as follows:</p>
<p>a. A summary of their company's capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities;</p>
<p>b. A description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel</p>
<p>c. Manufacturing past experience with Energetics within the last 10 years;</p>

<p>e. The ability to acquire facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle, store, and transport energetics materials; and</p>
<p>d. Possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the company is a large or small business and CAGE Code.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that multiple five year IDIQ contracts will be awarded should the Army release an RFP. Potential contractor proposals would be evaluated based on the solicitation requirements and IDIQ contracts will be awarded. M1020s will be purchased by the competitive delivery order process on those IDIQ contracts.</p>
<p>This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USG. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Mike Samra via email ONLY to: michael.w.samra.civ@mail.mil within 15 calendar days of this publication. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.</p>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Government plans to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract with General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to retrofit 108 each harvested RMS6-L Recuperators with Nitrogen (N2) and Fire Retardant Hydraulic (FRH) Fluid Gauges. The projected award date is December 2015 with deliveries from May of 2016 to August of 2017.   <br>  <br> The Recuperator, N2 Gauge Kit and FRH Gauge Kit (which include custom designed Go-No-Go N2 and FRH gauges, mounting bracket, valves, gaskets, O-rings, and hardware) are a proprietary design that are owned and manufactured by Elbit (formerly Soltam).  The Recuperator is part of the RMS6-L 120mm Mortar System on a Stryker Mortar Carrier variant and performs like two shock absorbers which control the movement of the gun between battery and recoil positions. During retrofit of these two gauges, the Recuperator needs to be machined or modified to retrofit the Gauge Kits. These gauges are required and critical as it ensures the pressure level on the N2 and FRH chambers are equal, otherwise the gun will be out of battery position. Serious injury to the soldier can occur if the gun is fired while there is a high pressure differential between the two chambers (such as completely drained Nitrogen chamber), which also will cause damage to both the Recuperator and the gun recoil system. Consequently, tolerance control of the Kit components and Recuperator machining are critical. The gauges must operate and be readable at extreme temperatures (-25 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit weapon temperature), including during the Rate-of-Fire (maximum pressure) condition. <br>  <br> GDLS, the OEM for the Stryker Family of Vehicles, is the only known source with the unique engineering expertise, system level Technical Data Package, and the restrictive contract arrangements with Elbit, the OEM for the Recuperator, to fulfill this requirement. Since new production vehicles and some retrofitted vehicles already have the N2 and FRH gauges, the new source shall maintain backward compatibility with the existing N2 and FRH Kits components.  <br>  <br> To maximize subcontracting opportunities, GDLS will be directed contractually to compete work at principal subcontractor and lower tier vendor levels in support of Government competition objectives.  <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which the agency will consider.

<DESC>Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has made a number of programmatic decisions since the Industry Day held on 18 June 2015 at Fort Belvoir, VA. The primary changes are listed below.
<p>1. The Government intends to release the solicitation in search of a design that includes holes in the helmet shell for the retention system and the night vision goggle bracket. The Army's current 7 Pad Suspension System and current Improved Retention System shall be acquired from the traditional Government-mandated sources listed in the Purchase Description (PD). The vendor shall not provide their own suspension or retention system designs for the initial solicitation.</p>
<p>2. The Government intends to require interested vendors to conduct testing at a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) approved laboratory. Although interested vendors are welcome to conduct testing at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), it will not be a required testing location. All approved testing locations will be considered equal during proposal evaluation and source selection. The required testing matrix will be provided with the release of the solicitation.</p>
<p>3. The Purchase Description (PD) will be updated to include changes appropriate for helmets manufactured with polyethylene (PE) or PE hybrids. This will bring the ACH Gen II PD in line with other recent helmet PDs, such as that for the Improved Head Protection System (IHPS), Advanced Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet (ACVC-H), and the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH).</p>
<p>A draft PD is included with this special notice. Please note that not all requirements or verifications have been fully finalized. This is for informational purposes only. The finalized and controlling PD will be released with the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE

Greenwich Associates  SS-OFR-16-007

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) intends to make award to Greenwich Associates, 6 High Ridge Park, Stamford, CT 06905-1327, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Subscription Services.  

OFR requires research covering the areas of fixed income market microstructure issues (including information on liquidity conditions in global fixed income markets), equity market microstructure issues in both the U.S. and overseas markets (i.e., coverage of key global fixed income markets), and market data across asset classes (derivatives, foreign exchange, corporate bonds, government bonds, etc.). OFR also requires coverage of market microstructure issues in both the U.S. Treasury and U.S. corporate bond markets. It is imperative for OFR/FSOC that the required market microstructure research information encompass covering market trading conditions, regulatory landscape, technological developments (e.g., electronic trading, market plumbing), and operational risks. Additionally, this market microstructure research must cover both the cash and derivatives markets for fixed income securities. The required published research must be based on proprietary surveys of market buyers (at least 50,000 annually) that covers fixed income and equity markets, including buy-side and sell-side market participants and issuers (e.g., corporate treasurers and CFOs). In order to sufficiently understand and use these data, access for OFR/FSOC users to the firms research analysts for bespoke or ad-hoc inquires is necessary. The aforementioned data must be unbiased and independent research (i.e. research that is not funded by outside sponsors). OFR requires a provider that has data going back to at least the 1970s in order to gain a long history of fixed income and equities market data to analyze trends.

Greenwich Associates is the leading provider of global market intelligence to the financial services industry. The market intelligence information provided by Greenwich in the areas of Fixed Income, Equities, Market Structure & Technology, and Derivatives is singularly unique in the financial marketplace. Greenwich Associates provides the most holistic view on market microstructure research given its coverage of multiple market segments. One reason for this uniqueness is due to over 60,000 interviews Greenwich completes on an annual basis. These interviews are conducted via the financial market network of Greenwich Associates. The survey data gathered from these interviews includes over 310,000 financial market participants and institutions, spanning 70 different countries, and 14 different languages. These interviews and the resulting survey data provide Greenwich clients with the most comprehensive, detailed, accurate, and un-biased data possible. No other vendor conducts this amount of in-depth market interviews. Greenwich is also singularly unique in the marketplace due to the number of years in the industry providing services to financial professionals. Since 1972, Greenwich Associates has provided high quality, in-depth financial market research to their customers; specifically fixed income data. No other vendor maintains fixed income data going back until 1972. 
 
NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice.  Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.

Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 1400 (2:00pm ET) October 21, 2015.  Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: WGUM/MFORBES.REF SS-OFR-16-007.  Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested requirement.  If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to Greenwich Associates.

Qualified contractors must provide the following:

1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.).  Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.

2. Whether your services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.

3. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company currently provides these products/services for.

4. DUNS Number.

The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:

.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.

Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.

No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.

This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award.  All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Air Force District of Washington Contracting Directorate (AFDW/PK) intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) for an all-inclusive, unseverable sponsorship package at their annual conference. The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10 - Market Research, specifically the results of market research concluded that only NAPABA is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement, because NAPABA does not allow other contractors to set up exhibitor booths or market through their organization without a sponsorship through NAPABA. This sole source acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, and FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and the applicable small business size standard is $15,000,000.00. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, the Government will consider all responses received by 29 October 2015, 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of proposals.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

	
	
	
	
	
    (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-
    (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200009 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-84 effective 5 October 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200009, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-16-Q-200009, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. <br />Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 26 October 2015 at 11:00 am EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 26 October 2015. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to Vincent.C.Pitt@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-16-Q-200009 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Deputy Country Representative - Macedonia - is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen, Europe and Eurasia, Asia (YEA) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in Macedonia.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAID/OTI's Macedonia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to support the OTI Country Representative with managing an implementing partner and may be called upon to represent OTI's program to local partners, senior-level U.S. government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>From peaceful independence in 1991 to 2001, Macedonia was the only former Yugoslavia country to emerge without suffering bloody inter-ethnic conflict despite its own multicultural makeup. Macedonia's transition continues to be a work in progress and it has been challenged by political turmoil in the first half of 2015. As a result, Macedonia is facing its greatest political crisis since the violent conflict in 2001.</p>
<p>Recent events have shed light on alleged criminal behavior by government officials that surfaced from the leaking of illegally wiretapped conversations. The content of these tapes, released by the opposition, prompted Macedonians to take to the streets in May 2015 demanding government reforms and the resignation of the prime minister.  Following counter-rallies in support of the government and unrelated violence between Macedonian security forces and an armed group in northern Macedonia, the EU intervened and brokered a political deal, with support from the United States, between the ruling coalition and the opposition on July 15, 2015. The parties agreed to a plan with a short timeline for reform that includes the opposition's return to parliament, the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the alleged crimes exposed by the wiretaps, the appointment of opposition members to senior positions in several ministries, increased media freedom, the prime minister's resignation 100 days before parliamentary elections, reforms to the electoral process, and new parliamentary elections in April 2016.</p>
<p>Aligned with USG policy priorities, USAID/OTI's program will support reform efforts laid out in the July 2015 political agreement and engage the population on reform processes including key issues pertaining to the April 2016 elections and beyond. USAID/OTI activities will be designed to promote democratic space and civic engagement. Focus areas will include greater civic engagement and public awareness through media programming and related outreach activities as well as increasing civil society engagement with the population to advocate around key reform issues.</p>
<p>The USAID/OTI program will coordinate with, and complement, other USAID and Department of State assistance efforts, as well as those of other donors - particularly as it pertains to support for media and civil society.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions including budget preparation, financial management, records management, and travel assistance, to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the OTI Country Representative to develop an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the U.S. Embassy, bilateral donors, United Nations organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;<br /> <br />&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>***AMENDMENT 0006: PROVIDE GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO [OPEN] INDUSTRY QUESTIONS RECEIVED AS OF 13 OCTOBER 2015*** <br>  <br> Amendment 0006 provides Government responses to [open] Industry questions received as of 13 October 2015, as follows: <br>  <br> Question #50 <br>  <br> Reference Section J Attachment 26 FWS-CS SSCamIP 2009 Modeling Guidance, page 20.  The SSCamIP Modeling Guidance Attachment 26 to the subject solicitation has a different Atmosphere page for the model than in the August 2009 version of the model.  The 2009 version of the model does not have a turbulence input as is on page 20 of Attachment 26. Can information be provided to obtain a new model, if this is required?                                                                                                                                                                 Government Response to Question #50 <br>  <br> There was an issue with the original CDs that Sensiac provided for the 2009 versions of the SSCamIP model.  It did not include the correct 'atmosphere' input page (the Cn2 and altitude options were missing). Sensiac sent out replacements for the CDs, but there is the possibility that someone might have the original CD.  If the version of SSCamIP being used by a potential offeror does not include all of the atmospheric inputs as pictured on page 20 of Attachment 26, FWS-CS SSCamIP Modeling Guidance, the offeror can email their request for the updated SSCamIP model to 'nvlmodels@nvl.army.mil' and an updated copy of the model will be sent to them via the AMRDEC file SAFE site. <br>  <br> ***END AMENDMENT 0006***     <br>   <br>  <br> ***AMENDMENT 0005: PROVIDE GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO [OPEN] INDUSTRY QUESTIONS RECEIVED AS OF 5 OCTOBER 2015***  <br>    <br>  Amendment 0005 provides Government responses to [open] Industry questions received as of 5 October 2015, as follows:  <br>    <br>  Question #41  <br>    <br>  Reference Section B CLIN 0019; Section C, 3.2.5.4.5, FWS-CS First Article Test (FAT) Exit Criteria; and Table 3.2. Anticipated FWS-CS LRIP Test Schedule.  Section B states,  quote mark CLIN 0019, PY5 FIRST ARTICLE TEST (FAT) REPORT FFP FWS-CS First Article Test (FAT) Report, IAW SOW paragraphs 3.3.8.7  quote mark Test Reports quote mark  and 3.2.5.4.6  quote mark FWS-CS First Article Test (FAT) Exit Criteria. quote mark   Section C, 3.2.5.4.5 states,  quote mark The Contractor shall successfully address the following questions and deliver all CDRLs, see CDRL-GGG associated with the event. CLIN 0019 shall apply toward FAT report. Government approval that the Contractor has accomplished/verified the following: quote mark   <br>  SOW paragraph 3.2.5.4.6 refers to  quote mark FWS-CS PRR Exit Criteria quote mark  and we assume this CLIN 0019 reference should instead be to 3.2.5.4.5.  <br>    <br>  SOW paragraph 3.2.5.4.5 requires FAT as a 3.2.5.4 FWS-CS LRIP Formal Review, Table 3.2 indicates it as an LRIP Test Event 4 months after FRP.  Does the Government require FAT to be priced during LRIP as part of CLIN 0012, the tests performed for CDRL-GGG?  This would be outside of the LRIP period of performance and would use the FRP First Lot Build.  Or is CLIN 0019 to be used to price all FAT activities and FRP First Lot Build units?  Or is CLIN 0019 used only for FAT activities and test reports?  Please clarify the intent of First Article Test as an LRIP event as well as the CLIN(s) used for FAT pricing.                                                                                                                                                                    <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #41  <br>    <br>  FAT is to be conducted on a sample from the first production lot of the final production configuration of LRIP, incorporating all changes resulting from prior testing (IOT&E, RGT-2, PQT, etc).  Conduct of the FAT is not a separately priced event and should be captured in the offeror's LRIP system production unit pricing in CLIN 0003 (reference Question #33 of Amendment #3).  CLIN 0019 should include pricing for the FAT Report, not conduct of the FAT itself.  Execution of the FAT on a sample of systems from the first production lot of LRIP will occur per the timeline cited in Table 3.2, approximately 4 months following the FRP decision.     <br>    <br>  Section B, CLIN 0019 narrative was revised to correct the SOW paragraph reference to 3.2.5.4.5 for FWS-CS First Article Test (FAT) Exit Criteria in Amendment 0003 (Question #25).  <br>    <br>  Question #42  <br>    <br>  Reference RFP Amendment 0003 Question #29 Answer, and Section C 3.3.4.1 Level of Repair Analysis (LORA).  The RFP states,  quote mark The Contractor shall initiate the LORA process for the FWS-CS system and associated TMDE during EMD, see CDRL-DDD, and update during LRIP, if an option is awarded, (see CDRL-HHH and CDRL-III) to aid in assessing the supportability of a system. quote mark   <br>    <br>  The first requirement for TMDE availability begins with the LORA requirement to initiate the LORA process during EMD with CDRL-DDD as deliverable. The first TMDE unit delivery does not occur until LRIP as noted by the Answer to Question #29 for TM training and for PQT.  No design review is required for the TMDE prior to LORA.  Additionally, no guidance is provided on how TMDE NRE should be priced.  We assume we should price TMDE NRE in CLIN 0001.  Is this assumption correct?  Please clarify the timing and CLIN (s) to be used for TMDE NRE as well as when design reviews of the TMDE occur.  <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #42  <br>    <br>  TMDE NRE pricing should be included as part of CLIN 0010 (CDRL-EEE, LRIP System Engineering).  <br>    <br>  TMDE hardware is not required until LRIP.  SOW paragraph 3.4.6 TMDE, cites that TMDE is required to fulfill CLIN 0013 (CDRL-HHH, LRIP IPS & HSI for TMDE) and CLIN 0014 (CDRL-III LRIP IPS & HSI), along with CLINs 0002 (LRIP Qual Systems), 0008 (TMDE), and 0009 (TMDE Spares), all which occur during LRIP.  <br>    <br>  In SOW paragraph 3.4.7 EAD, it states that the Government will verify all repair actions using the Contractor's Fault-Tree analysis. CDRL-DDD (IPS & HSI), which is part of CLIN 0001 EMD, references Operator/Crew Training Materials, and DID-023 states specific content for basic diagnosis and fault finding.  CLIN 0001, CDRL-DDD, Technical Guide would include Root Cause System Fault Tree Flow Chart to be used at EAD.  The intent is to analyze the vendor's process for repair before building any TMDE equipment.  This is reinforced per SOW paragraph 3.4.8.2 Maintainer Level LD,  which is a subparagraph of 3.4.8 Logistic Demonstration, where the Government states that the Sustainment LD(s) will demonstrate that the FWS-CS and TMDE meet all logistics/maintainability and HSI requirements at the Sustainment-Level, and will identify any system design changes needed for improved supportability and/or reduced life cycle cost.  FWS-CS and TMDE must be available to support the FWS-CS Sustainment Level LD, and supporting tasks shall be shown in the Contractor's IMS.  <br>  SOW paragraph 3.4.10 Training, cites that the Government requires training as stated - During LRIP, the Contractor shall provide required training material to the Government for RGT-2, GDT, LD and IOT&E and to adequately reflect the FWS-CS, and TMDE being provided under this contract and in accordance with the approved maintenance concept.    <br>    <br>  In SOW paragraph 3.4.10.2 Training Materials, the Government states that training shall provide students with the skills necessary to operate and maintain the system(s), see CDRL-HHH for TMDE training materials. CDRL appendix shows CDRL-HHH as LRIP IPS & HSI for TMDE, and DID-023 provides the specific content to be addressed for CDRL-HHH.  <br>    <br>  Question #43  <br>    <br>  Reference RFP Amendment 0003, Question #29 Answer.  The Answer to Question #29 states,  quote mark ... Starting at PQT, 18 systems and 1 TMDE system will be required. quote mark   It is our experience on programs of similar size, scope and structure that the initial delivery of a TMDE set occurs during EMD.  Question #29 indicates the first delivery of a TMDE set occurs during LRIP.  Does the Government require the delivery or the availability of a TMDE set in EMD?  If so, when?  Please clarify the earliest Government required TMDE availability or delivery.  <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #43  <br>    <br>  See response to Question #42.  TMDE hardware is not required until LRIP.  <br>    <br>  Question #44  <br>    <br>  Reference Section C, 3.4.1 Warranty of Equipment which states,  quote mark  quote mark ... For the production phase, the Contractor shall provide a storage/transportation warranty, which extends from the date of initial Government acceptance and expires one year hence or until initial issue, whichever occurs first. TMDE warranty will be for a minimum of 1 year for LRIP, and through production... During the warranty period, the Contractor shall repair or replace within 3 months of receipt - at no cost to the Government - any FWS-CS system, TMDE, and related spare parts that fails under normal operations, while in storage, or during transportation... Government acceptance of a storage warranty does not limit the Government's rights under any other term or condition of this contract. quote mark   <br>    <br>  Are Offerors correct in interpreting the requirement as two separate warranties?   <br>    <br>  1. For Systems (a storage/transportation warranty of  1 year):  quote mark For the production phase, the Contractor shall provide a storage/ transportation warranty, which extends from the date of initial Government acceptance and expires one year hence or until initial issue, whichever occurs first. quote mark   <br>    <br>   AND  <br>    <br>  2. For TMDE (a standard 1 year warranty for material and workmanship):  quote mark TMDE warranty will be for a minimum of 1 year for LRIP, and through production. quote mark    <br>  Then is the word  quote mark applicable quote mark  implied as interpreted correctly here,  quote mark During the ( quote mark applicable quote mark ) warranty period, the Contractor shall repair or replace within 3 months of receipt - at no cost to the Government - any FWS-CS system, TMDE, and related spare parts that fails under normal operations, while in storage, or during transportation. quote mark ?  <br>    <br>  And the Government clearly understands, by reaffirmation, that they have accepted a storage warranty as detailed in 3.4.1,  quote mark Government acceptance of a storage warranty does not limit the Government's rights under any other term or condition of this contract. quote mark  and that no other warranty exists or is implied?  Please clarify that this interpretation of 3.4.1 is correct.  <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #44  <br>    <br>  Yes, there are two different warranties required (one for systems/spares and one for TMDE).  The intent for systems/spares is a storage warranty.  For TMDE, a standard 1 year warranty is required.  The statement referenced in paragraph 3.4.1 remains as stated.  There may be occasions where specific additional warranty remedies may be required (i.e. a defect specific warranty may be agreed upon as part of closure a failure report, which would be in addition to contract warranty requirements).    <br>    <br>  Question #45  <br>    <br>  Reference Section C, 3.4.10, 3.4.10.1 which states,  quote mark The TMDE shall command the LRF to fire and measure pulse energy and beam divergence. quote mark   While the performance of a phosphor coated camera is less than an InGaAs camera, the InGaAs camera performance comes at an exponentially higher cost.  We believe a phosphor coated camera provides sufficient information for a maintainer repair decision.  Can the field-expedient LRF beam divergence measurement be limited to what is possible using a phosphor coated camera?  This would enable a higher TMDE value proposition (TMDE cost versus performance). Will the government approve the use of a phosphor coated camera for the LRF divergence measurement?  Please modify the requirement to allow a phosphor coated camera for the LRF divergence measurement by the TMDE.   <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #45  <br>    <br>  The Government is not requiring specific equipment as part of the TMDE, but rather specifying TMDE capabilities needed for maintenance and verification testing in the field.  The offeror shall determine what equipment is required to meet the stated requirement  quote mark The TMDE shall command the LRF to fire and measure pulse energy and beam divergence quote mark  for their proposed FWS-CS solution and provide supporting narrative as part of Subfactor 3, Logistics, of the proposal.     <br>    <br>  Question #46  <br>    <br>  Reference Section C, 3.4.11.1 Instructor and Key Personnel Training (I&KPT) which states,  quote mark The Contractor shall prepare I&KPT materials.  The Contractor shall conduct an Operator and Crew-level training course and a Maintainer-level training course.  Training shall be conducted within the Continental United States (CONUS) Government-selected sites.  The objective of the I&KPT is to provide FWS-CS operators and maintainers the required skills to operate and support the systems in a structured school environment, in garrison, and in a field environment, see CDRL-DDD and CDRL-III. quote mark   The Government requires a Maintainer-level training course during EMD with submission identified in CDRL-DDD. To develop the maintainer-level training a complete TMDE Set is required. Is it the Government's intention to require a TMDE Set be built for these classes?  Please clarify the Government's intent on availability of the TMDE during EMD.   <br>       <br>  Government Response to Question #46  <br>    <br>  See response to Question #42.  TMDE hardware is not required until LRIP.  <br>    <br>  Question #47  <br>    <br>  Reference Section C, 3.4.11.1 Types of Manuals which states,  quote mark For the EMD phase, the Contractor shall deliver a Technical guide for the operator/crew level and maintainer level maintenance and training documentation for operator/crew level, maintainer level training, see CDRL-DDD, for presentation for EAD. The Technical guides shall provide inspection, basic operation procedures, and troubleshooting procedures for FWS-CS during the EMD phase. quote mark   The Government requires a maintainer level maintenance and training documentation for operator/crew level, maintainer level training, see CDRL-DDD, for presentation for EAD during EMD  To develop the maintainer-level Technical guides a complete TMDE Set is required.  Is it the Government's intention to require a TMDE Set be built as would be required to develop these guides?  Please clarify the Government's intent on availability of the TMDE during EMD.   <br>                                         <br>  Government Response to Question #47  <br>    <br>  See response to Question #42.  TMDE hardware is not required until LRIP.   <br>     <br>  Question #48  <br>    <br>  Reference Section C, Appendix A 6.6.1 which states,  quote mark The TMDE shall command the LRF to fire and measure pulse energy and beam divergence. quote mark   While the performance of a phosphor coated camera is less than an InGaAs camera, the InGaAs camera performance comes at an exponentially higher cost.  We believe a phosphor coated camera provides sufficient information for a maintainer repair decision.  Can the field-expedient LRF beam divergence measurement be limited to what is possible using a phosphor coated camera?  This would enable a higher TMDE value proposition (TMDE cost versus performance). Will the government approve the use of a phosphor coated camera for the LRF divergence measurement?  Please modify the requirement to allow a phosphor coated camera for the LRF divergence measurement by the TMDE.   <br>    <br>  Government Response to Question #48  <br>    <br>  See response to question #45  <br>    <br>  ***END AMENDMENT 0005***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>    <br>  ***AMENDMENT 0004: UPDATE PROPOSAL DUE DATE TO 30 OCTOBER 2015, UPDATE SOLICITATION DOCUMENTATION (SECTIONS A, B, H, and L), AND PROVIDES GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO [OPEN] INDUSTRY QUESTIONS RECIEVED AS OF 30 SEPTEMBER 2015***   <br>      <br>   Amendment 0004 updates the proposal due date to 12:00PM (noon) Eastern Standard 30 October 2015, updates Sections A, B, H and L, and provides Government responses to [open] industry questions received as of 30 September 2015.

The updated formula is related to the expected 10 year system life of the FWS-CS.  For every 30 days (or portion thereof) a system is late, the formula calculates the value of one month of a 120 month (10 year) system life.  The updated consideration formula is as follows:   <br>      <br>    _(i=1)^n  ((Unit Cost)/120* Total Systems Delinquent for Monthi)     <br>      <br>   b.  No.   <br>   c.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to solicitation VA247-15-Q-0929 is to:

1.	Extend the offer due date from Tuesday, October 13th, 2015 at 1:00 pm to Monday, October 17, 2015 @ 1:00 pm to allow additional time for receipt of offers.

2.	Post Questions & Answers all follows: 
"	What is the monthly cost? $1359.63
"	The H&W is listed at $4.02 is this correct? Please see the attachment 1- Wage Determination 
"	How many employees work at the site now? 1
"	Who is the current contractor? Walter Scott Janitorial 
"	For the solicitation listed above is daily service require 5 days a week of clean. Please advise how many cleaning days a week you want service? 5 days 
"	Can you provide a space survey report? Please see attachment 2-Warehouse 
"	How many employees are in building for paper goods estimation? 18
"	I only see carpet extraction in the initial deep cleaning?  The initial deep cleaning should suffice if regular vacuuming is performed.  HOWEVER - the standards of cleanliness states that carpets shall be stain free.  So if extracting is required to meet that requirement, extracting is required.  Annual or scheduled extraction is not required.  Daily vacuuming is required.
"	Did you want us to include any other carpet cleaning? See above
"	As I read through the scope of work, I realized that there is no floor care for the warehouse floors after all.  It has dust mop or damp mop for the tile floor, nothing for the concrete flooring.  I know that your current cleaner is not mopping this floor at all.  On page 7 under the minimum cleaning frequency chart in "all other spaces" it calls for dust and wet mop tile floors.  This is meant to cover all non-carpeted floors: VCT, stone, tile, laminate, concrete, etc.  The current contractor may or may not be mopping the floor - not coincidentally, his option years haven't been renewed.
"	Did you want any floor care included in the back?  My suggestion is weekly dust mop and monthly damp mop.  Let me know. In the general section it states that the flooring is mostly concrete.  Bottom line is if the concrete floor is inspected and found deficient based on the standards of cleanliness - which addresses ALL floors - it is going to be an issue.  Frequency is up to your discretion since it isn't specifically addressed in the statement of work.  Keep in mind ALL floors must be clean and free of dust, soil, stains, etc.  Reference the standards of cleanliness in all areas and performance should be satisfactory.  The space will be inspected regularly by the government.  It needs to be kept to standard or potentially face the invoice deducts as stated in the quality assurance surveillance plan.

3.	All other terms and conditions of Solicitation VA247-15-Q-0929 remain the same.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to Questions from vendors submitted by the question submission deadline.
Questions and Answers (Solicitation VA249-16-Q-0019)
Question:
    1.  "In section G, the solicitation states that all testing of repaired equipment must be complete within 4 hours of being notified by the facility. As stated, that requires the contractor be local. However, if the meaning of the statement should be within 4 hours after repair assuming the facility notifies the contractor when the machine is down, it allows for contractors to be from more than the local area."
Answer:  Once a piece of equipment is repaired, it must be tested within 4 hours.

Question:
    2.  Does the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation under solicitation number VA24916Q0019 contain requirements similar to a current contract?  If possible, please provide the current contract number.  Or, is this a new requirement for the government?

Answer:  This is a new requirement.


Please note: The time frame for submitting questions in regards to this solicitation has closed. The closing date and time was October 13, 2015 at 4:00PM CST - NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED.

<DESC><p>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to issue a solicitation W52P1J-15-R-0090 for Ammunition Supply Point/ Theater Storage Area (ASP/TSA) 2.0 operational services at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait at a later date.</p>
<p>This is an announcement for a site-visit that will be held in Kuwait on November 11, 2015. A tour will be provided of the ASP and TSA locations. This site-visit is to familiarize interested companies with the requirements and physical location of performance for services that will be performed under the ASP/TSA 2.0 contract. A draft of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached and it is ACC-RI's intent to issue a draft of the Solicitation at a future date. Previously, a sources sought announcement was issued on 02 March 2015 under solicitation number W52P1J-15-0090, seeking interest from industry prior to release of a potential solicitation.</p>
<p>ACC-RI intends to conduct a full and open, Best Value competition to award a single-Cost Plus Fixed Fee - Performance Based Incentive Fee (CPFF-PBIF) contract.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is anticipated to be one base year plus four one year evaluated option periods. It is estimated that a Formal Solicitation will be issued on or about 25 November 2015. This date is subject to change and future notices will provide updates.</p>
<p>The successful Offeror for this acquisition will be required to provide the services, resources, and management for Class V and GFE Maintenance operations at the Arifjan ASP and TSA in support of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (1st TSC) for all ammunition stocks accounted for by 1st TSC to U.S. Military/ Government components, Department of Defense (DOD) agencies and, as required, Coalition Forces in the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR). The principal functions performed in the ASP/TSA are the issue, storage, and receipt of munitions (both training and war-reserve), munitions components, munitions packing and packaging material, and munitions-related material. Associated functions include: supporting periodic munitions readiness inspections; stock accountability, stock control, warehousing; munitions and non-munitions material salvage/residue accountability, munitions reclamation, amnesty, inventory, ASP/TSA munitions security; user turn-in (both training and war-reserve); packaging, shipment, and performing maintenance on all assigned support equipment. The ASP and the TSA must be operated in a manner that continually provides support to the customer.</p>
<p>It should be noted that any interested parties considering responding to a future solicitation for these requirements must be able to demonstrate the existence of a current U.S. facility clearance to the SECRET level IAW DODD 5220.22, National<br />Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. This SECRET level clearance may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. At the time a future solicitation is issued, all respondents will be required to submit Facility Clearances for all entities who will be handling classified information (to include, but not limited to: subcontractors, teaming, and any joint ventures) in accordance with the directions delineated in said solicitation document.</p>
<p>The maximum number of site-visit representatives from each interested organization is three. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to provide transportation to Camp Arijan. The Government will be responsible for picking up all interested participants at the Camp Arifjan Entry Control Point (ECP) (more details will be forthcoming), transporting them to the ASP and TSA locations and dropping all parties back at the Camp Arifjan ECP. All parties are responsible for transportation to and from the country of Kuwait, entry into Kuwait (securing visa), transportation to and from Kuwait City International Airport (KCIA), transportation to and from Camp Arifjan, Kuwait and their choice of lodging.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit the attached Intent to Attend ASP/TSA 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation to usarmy.RIA.acc.mbx.asp-tsa-2@mail.mil, no later than October 26, 2015. Please reference ASP/TSA 2.0 Site Visit in the subject of your e-mail.</p>
<p>Access to the secure U.S.Government facilities is restricted. Information submitted on this form will be used for installation access to secure facilities during the site visit. Failure to submit the Intent to Attend ASP/TSA 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation will result in forfeiture of the right to attend this site visit. Attendees will be required to present two forms of state-issued identification upon arrival to secure locations. Only those individuals who have provided the correct information and have passed the proper screening will be allowed to board the busses for the site visit at Camp Arifjan, therefore, it is important that all necessary information be provided by the date requested. If an individual does not pass the screening for access to a secure facility, the company representative will be notified prior to the site visit. <br />This site-visit announcement neither constitutes a Solicitation or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. In the event that there are changes to this site visit, all information will be posted on FBO.</p>

<DESC>On August 5, 2015, GAO sustained protests B-408558.7, B-408558.8, FCi Federal, Inc., and recommended that the Agency open discussions with all offerors remaining in the competition, request revised proposals, undertake a new evaluation of those revised proposals, and make a new selection decision. <br /><br />The Agency's needs have substantially changed since early 2013, when the subject solicitation was issued. The Agency has determined that, among other significant changes, approximately 36 of the 68 USCIS field offices will no longer need Field Office Support Services contractor support. In addition, ongoing changes to field support services due to USCIS's transformation project, which will replace paper-based applications with on-line filings, will result in changing some or all of the CLINs from fixed-price to Time and Materials.<br /><br />As a result, the Agency&nbsp;will be&nbsp;cancelling the solicitation, revising its requirements in accordance with its FY16 needs, issuing a new solicitation, and receiving new proposals. <br />

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Established in June 1917, Fort Jackson (the Installation), first known as the Sixth National Cantonment and later as Camp Jackson, has become the largest and most active Initial Entry Training Center in the United States Army. Established to answer America's call for trained fighting men in the early, ominous days of World War I, Fort Jackson has always served as the Army's pioneer in the training environment. Named in honor of Major General Andrew Jackson, a native son of the Palmetto State and the seventh president of the United States, Fort Jackson, which is located in the heart of the midlands region of South Carolina, was incorporated into the city of Columbia (the City) in 1968. The Installation's primary mission is providing the Army with trained, disciplined, motivated and physically fit Soldiers who uphold the Army's core values and are focused on teamwork. Succeeding in that mission means training in excess of 36,000 basic training and 8,000 advanced individual training Soldiers every year. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson is home to the U.S. Army Soldier Support Institute, the U.S. Army Chaplains Center and School, and the National Center for Credibility Assessment. It also is home to the Army's Drill Sergeant School, which trains all active and Reserve instructors.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 8pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Installation encompasses more than 52,000 acres of land with more than 100 ranges and field training sites and 1,160 buildings. Soldiers, civilians, retirees, and family members make up the Fort Jackson community that continues to grow in numbers and facilities. The Installation is home to more than 3,500 assigned active duty Soldiers and their 12,000 family members.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Fort Jackson employs almost 3,500 civilians and provides services to more than 46,000 retirees and their family members. An additional 10,000 students attend courses at the Soldier Support Institute, Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, the National Center for Credibility Assessment and Drill Sergeant School annually.</span></p>

<p>RE: "NAVAIR T&amp;E Process"<br />Date: Tuesday, 20 October 2015<br />Time: 1:30 PM- 3:30 PM<br />Location: (AFAMS building) Bishop Conference Center (Rm 126) 3051 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826</p>
<p>Background: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in partnership with Central Florida Chapter of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) has reestablished the Navy's Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings with Industry.</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of the IPT is to:<br />&bull; Remove any unnecessary barriers to reasonable communication and to provide a forum, consistent with existing law and regulation that promotes responsible and constructive exchanges between NAWCTSD and Industry. <br />&bull; Identify and resolve misconceptions about NAWCTSD flexibility regarding Government-vendor communications which hinder requirement transparency<br />&bull; Seek common ground for consistency in Government-vendor communications interface<br />&bull; Provide facts and strategies to help NAWCTSD acquisition professionals benefit from Industry's knowledge and insight.</p>
<p>Rules of Engagement: The IPT Sessions are not intended to discuss any current or future Business Opportunities. For capacity reasons, please RSVP to this announcement via the email: orlo_businesssupportteam@navy.mil. Industry is requested to limit participation to two representatives per company. We highly recommend Industry send a representative experienced in the Session Topics the IPT will address. Again, the IPT's are not business development meetings. The targeted group size is 80 individuals.</p>
<p>Topic: <br />Topic for October Government/Industry IPT Meeting: "NAVAIR T&amp;E Process"<br />NAWCTSD is in the process of aligning its Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) process to be in concert with NAVAIR's weapons systems T&amp;E process. While this transition is not yet complete, NAWCTSD will brief industry representatives on the state of this effort and is looking for feedback from industry as it relates to their training systems development efforts.</p>
<p>This agenda offers an effective exchange of information in order to improve the acquisition process. National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) will help moderate these IPTs and work to keep the discussion flowing and on the subject being addressed. We look forward to your participation</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />12211 Science Dr.<br />Code 253<br />Orlando, FL 32826-3224<br />United States</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />Bishop Conference Center (Room 126) AFAMS Building<br />3051 Technology Parkway<br />Orlando, FL 32826<br />United States</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the new construction of a U.S. Courthouse in Mobile, Alabama.</p>
<p>This building project is an opportunity in design and construction excellence.  GSA intends to build a new U.S. Courthouse that will be a focus of pride for the community it serves, as well as the nation.  The building shall be a functional, innovative, sustainable, cost-effective, and state-of-the-art federal court facility that will contribute to the overall design quality of downtown Mobile.</p>
<p>This project's 1.8 acre site is located directly across St. Louis Street from the historic John A. Campbell U.S. Courthouse.  The new, five-story U.S. Courthouse will comprise approximately 156,000 gross square feet.  This new construction project is a pivotal undertaking in extending the presence of the federal government within the community.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the new U.S. Courthouse project is currently estimated to be $315,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artist Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Mobile, Alabama, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on October 26, 2015.</p>
<p>Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.  If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at william.caine@gsa.gov or 202-501-4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.  GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

<DESC>The government has extended the period of performance on three Research and Development (R&D) contracts in support of a Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) consortium project. The project is Development of Medical Countermeasures for Botulinum Neurotoxin Intoxication Focused on Therapeutics and Neuroregenerative Medicines. DTRA has established a multicenter program in which directed research projects are submitted, evaluated and selected to sponsor a network of collaboration amongst researchers. Under the multicenter collaboration, three proposals were selected to be administered in coordination with U.S Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) collaborators: <br>  <br> a. Montclair State University (MSU): MSU is contributing to the botulinum drug discovery effort by synthesizing small molecule drug candidates for treatment of botulinum toxin exposure and optimizing their pharmaceutical properties. <br>  <br> b. Institute of Advanced Sciences (IAS): IAS will support the efforts at the USAMRICD by performing high throughput screening (HTS) of natural product and small molecule libraries. <br>  <br> c. Ossianix Inc: Ossianix will provide an alternative to traditional inhibitors by developing small single chain shark antibodies as potential inhibitors for catalytic activity. <br>  <br> The reason for the extension through December 31, 2015 is to allow additional research for USAMRICD to complete the first cycle of this consortium effort. After discussions between the collaborating parties it was determined that additional time and funding would be needed obtain the necessary objectives prior to the next research cycle. Funding in the amount of $75,000 for MSU and $75,000 for the Institute of Advanced Sciences will be provided to complete the first cycle of the research. Ossianix will be receiving a completion date extension <br> using the funding made available at the time of initial contract.

<AWARDEE>IMMIXTECHNOLOGY, INC.;8444 WESTPARK DR STE 200;MCLEAN;VA;22102
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way 
     	Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action: The proposed sole source action is for a one-year firm-fixed price task order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to ImmixTechnology Inc., 8444 Westpark Drive, Suite 200, McLean, VA 22102.    

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:   The proposed action is to provide maintenance, technical support, enhancements and regulatory updates of the Accu-Care Clinical Software version 6.3 which provides a Resident Assement Instrument (RAI) of nursing home patients.  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987 required the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to designate a RAI of nursing home patients that includes a Minimum Data Set (MDS).  CMS published final regulations requiring facilities to encode and transmit MDS data to their State on December 23, 1997.  In 1999, VA procured a commercial RAI/MDS patient assessment instrument, Accu-Care.  Accu-Care is still the RAI/MDS assessment tool used within the VA and has progressed through a number of updates, the current version used being Accu-Care Version 6.3.  All data entered in the assessment is transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center.  From that information, data performance measures for the Community Living Centers (CLCs), cost, and quality reports are developed by the Decision Support Service.  The Spinal Cord Injury and Diseases Department uses the data to determine the acuity for all spinal cord residents in the CLC.  Additionally, the Allocation Resource Center uses the data to quantify the appropriate fiscal allocations that should be sent to the 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks each year based in part on CLC workload.  Finally, the interdisciplinary staffs use the information to form individualized treatment plans that are then used to provide guidelines for providing care to all residents in the 137 CLCs.  The contractor will provide 24 hour technical support via the company's toll free number.  Without this software the CLCs would no longer have a standardized assessment, VHA would lose its ability to compare its nursing home data with non-federal nursing homes, and VA Central Office (VACO) would lose valuable data which is instrumental in the development of performance measures. The total estimated value of the proposed action is 
                     
4.  Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The original equipment manufacturer Accu-Med Technology Solutions has entered into a partnership with ImmixTechnology Inc. to be the sole Government provider of Accu-Care software products.  VA has utilized the Accu-Care software for over a decade, and it is the system which is utilized VA-wide to meet the requirement for an RAI/MDS tool.  Although VA is in the process of awarding a competitive procurement for a new RAI/MDS tool, the contract for the new system will not be awarded before the expiration of the current maintenance contract necessary for the Accu-Care licenses to remain valid.  In order to meet the requirement for RAI/MDS while the competitive effort is finalized, the current Accu-Care maintenance must be renewed so that the software can be utilized until the follow-on competitive effort is awarded and new software is deployed.  The maintenance requires knowledge of Accu-Care's proprietary software specifications and therefore the VA's requirement for Accu-Care maintenance can only be met with Accu-Care's proprietary maintenance which is only available to the Government through ImmixTechnology, Inc.  The current maintenance expires on September 30, 2015, at which time the perpetual software licenses will not be valid, leading to a loss of the RAI/MDS tool for VA CLCs.  Without this software, the CLCs would no longer have a standardized assessment, VHA would lose its ability to compare its nursing home data with non-federal nursing homes, and VACO would lose valuable data which is instrumental in the development of performance measures.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet VA's requirement for Accu-Care software maintenance.  Competition is not viable as there is only one authorized reseller for the Accu-Care software maintenance.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized and the justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  The justification will be made available with the Request for Quotation on the NASA SEWP V GWAC.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  This action is necessary to ensure VA retains maintenance coverage, required for the current Accu-Care software licenses to remain valid, while VA awards the competitive solicitation for a new RAI/MDS tool to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2016 and implements the replacement tool.  The current maintenance contract expires on September 30, 2015 at which time the perpetual software licenses will not be valid, leading to a loss of the RAI/MDS tool for the CLCs which will not allow them to meet the Congressional Mandate for all CLCs to have a RAI/MDS software suite.  

8.  Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research by posting a Request for Information (RFI) on NASA SEWP on May 13, 2015.  In the RFI, the Government requested capability statements from vendors that could demonstrate their current ability to provide support and maintenance.  The RFI yielded no responses, however, ImmixTechnology responded in July 2015, subsequent to the closing date of the RFI.  Accu-Med Technology has confirmed that there are no authorized resellers of its software.  However, Accu-Med has partnered with ImmixTechnology through NASA SEWP to be the sole provider of Accu-Care software suites.  Although other vendors possess similar capabilities to provide the required maintenance only Accucare or an authorized reseller has access to the proprietary source code specific to the maintenance for this particular software.

<DESC>The focus of this effort will be to further the efforts conducted under contract M67854-11-C-3015. All efforts under the new vehicle stem directly from reasearch previously conducted under M67854-11-C-3015 and award to any other company would require substantial duplication of tasks and funds already contributed under the previous effort for canines, individuals, training and research. The continuity of all these aspects combined is critical to the success of the new effort.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Special Operations Forces, U.S. Marine Corp, U.S. Army Research Office, and Joint Military Working Dog Program have strategic needs in support of advancing the capability, training, science and technology, and analysis of using military working dogs for the fight against terrorism. Military working dog systems developed in the recent combat activities in Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated new opportunities and gaps in the use of military working dogs for security and tactical operations. The requirements in this effort are directly relevant to enhancing capabilities developed in the IED Defeat Dog program at K2 Solutions and leveraging into new programs now that those efforts have ended and the challenge has changed. The Joint Military Working Dog program and the Army Research Office have basic and applied research needs surrounding the fundamental aspects of canine genetics for dog selection, scent improvement performance, advanced training, advanced off-leash operational procedures and kit and gear for canines. These needs are validated in the JMWDP requirements documents.
