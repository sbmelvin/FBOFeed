We will award University of Mumbai as sole source contractor. Nature of this contract is a grant rather than a normal contract. Initially, we tried to make a grant IAW 10.U.S.C. 2358 and 31 U.S.C. 6304. However, we found out that our contract writing system at overseas did not allow making a grant.

Low price or best value procedures will be used for competing task orders. The total Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MATOC pool capacity shall not exceed $10,000,000. Each MATOC contract will be awarded at this dollar value for post award administrative convenience only. The Government will track award amounts of all the MATOC holders to ensure the capacity is not exceeded. The IDIQ MATOCs are five year contracts. Task orders will be issued as firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders. Each task order will be issued as a service contract.<br />This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE: It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about August 16, 2016.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of TLD reader maintenance and calibration services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. Business size standard for NAICS 811219 is $20.5M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Radiation Detection Company, Inc., 3527 Snead Dr, Georgetown Texas 78628. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a Sole Source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 11:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 22 July 2016. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Radiation Detection Company, Inc. is currently the only vendor authorized by the manufacturer, Panasonic Industrial Division of North America, capable of providing the calibration and maintenance service on the TLD Readers.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to brian.maser@us.af.mil no later than 11:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 22 July 2016. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-16-T-0361, TLD Reader Maint." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail, ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)
Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 532490 with the related size standard of $32.5 million. The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: SFC Craig Ritchey Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 240-3194 Email: craig.m.ritchey.mil@mail.mil <BR> <BR>All equipment shall conform to the PWS, and will be inspected at the time of delivery by an appointed government representative, and the vendor. <BR> <BR>52.208-4 -- Vehicle Lease Payments. 52.208-5 -- Condition of Leased Vehicles. 52.208-6 -- Marking of Leased Vehicles. <BR> <BR>52.228-8 -- Liability and Insurance -- Leased Motor Vehicles.

(b) The Contractor shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government against, all actions or claims for loss of or damage to property or the injury or death of persons, resulting from the fault, negligence, or wrongful act or omission of the Contractor, its agents, or employees.
(c) The Contractor shall provide and maintain insurance covering its liabilities under paragraph (b) of this clause, in amounts of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for death or bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage or loss.
(d) Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>252.204-7008 Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls. As prescribed in 204.7304(a), use the following provision: COMPLIANCE WITH SAFEGUARDING COVERED DEFENSE INFORMATION CONTROLS (DEC 2015) (a) Definitions. As used in this provision? ?Controlled technical information,? ?covered contractor information system,? and ?covered defense information? are defined in clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. (b) The security requirements required by contract clause 252.204-7012, Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, shall be implemented for all covered defense information on all covered contractor information systems that support the performance of this contract. (c) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an information technology (IT) service or system operated on behalf of the Government (see 252.204-7012(b)(1)(ii))? (1) By submission of this offer, the Offeror represents that it will implement the security requirements specified by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ?Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations? (see http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171), not later than December 31, 2017. (2)(i) If the Offeror proposes to vary from any of the security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-171 that is in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer, the Offeror shall submit to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), a written explanation of? (A) Why a particular security requirement is not applicable; or (B) How an alternative but equally effective, security measure is used to compensate for the inability to satisfy a particular requirement and achieve equivalent protection. (ii) An authorized representative of the DoD CIO will adjudicate offeror requests to vary from NIST SP 800-171 requirements in writing prior to contract award. Any accepted variance from NIST SP 800-171 shall be incorporated into the resulting contract. (End of provision) <BR> <BR>

<p>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is not soliciting but is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response.

Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends &lsquo;PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br /><br />6. Responses will be reviewed only by Alabama National Guard personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br /><br />The Alabama National Guard Aviation is charged with ensuring an aviation mission-ready force. This is accomplished by the performance of required and periodic assessments and maintenance of aviation equipment to determine and ensure readiness of fully functional assets and airframes. To assist in accomplishment of this requirement fully-functional, mobile, aviation tool kits are required. <br /><br />Current on hand tool boxes are worn and many replacement tools and parts are no longer available nor are they suitable for repair. The current on-hand tools are from a mixture of manufacturers. Recent market research shows that of the mixture of manufacturers many no longer manufacture tools in America or they can no longer provide tools that meet the Aviation Grade tooling requirements. Many of the more commonly used tools are heavily worn and have been replaced many times. As tools are worn out or broken it has become difficult to procure a suitable replacement that meet Aviation Grade tooling restrictions.<br /><br />Additionally historical and empirical data reveal that tools used for this purpose typically break and require replacement and repair. When the tools are in for repair or broken the entire tool box is quarantined from use due to strict aviation maintenance safety and tool inventory policies. The Alabama National Guard, in order to enable and ensure unit readiness and mission accomplishment requires an on-site warranty replacement of acquired tools on a minimum weekly basis.<br /><br />In order to solve the maintenance readiness issue, a catalog of tools and equipment has been developed that identifies all tools required to meet current Army Regulations, and Manuals, supports current Army Air Frames and meet the requirements of the Alabama Army National Guard. Each tool kit will be turnkey - etched, assembled and ready to issue upon delivery.<br /><br />This list includes the tool box and the easy visual inventory "Shadowbox" foam cutout placement mats, which hold and visually indicates the location and presence of the specified tools in drawers. Tools shall be shadowed in chemical resistant tool control foam. The tool control foam shall meets Alabama National Guard specification for Class, Grade, and Type category criteria.<br /><br />The Army National Guard has three location in Alabama in which 15 complete aviation tool kits will be delivered and provided warranty service throughout their lifecycle. These locations are Army Aviation Support Facilities (AASF) in Alabama - AASF#1 in Montgomery, AASF#2 in Birmingham, and AASF#3 in Mobile.<br /><br />Each tool kit shall be etched in a specified manner that identifies every specific tool to one specific tool box. All warranty replacement tools will conform to this specification. Laser Etching is accomplished without Use of Chemicals and does not wear off or accelerate corrosion.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example;</span>15 tool boxes at AASF#1 <br />All tools in tool box 1 shall be etched AASF#1BX1 and sequencing will continue through AASF#1BX15. <br /><br />Each box at each AASF location AASF#1, AASF#2 and AASF#3 will conform to this criteria. --- AASF#2BX1 through AASF#2BX15; and <br />AASF#3BX1 through AASF#3BX15<br /><br /><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO</strong><br /><br />TAA refers to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. &amp; 2501-2581), which is intended to foster fair and open international trade. TAA requires that the U.S. Government may acquire only "U.S. - made or designated country end products.<br /><br />TM 1-1500-204-23-1 <br />Aviation Grade <br />PROPER USE OF PLATED TOOLS <br />Use only chrome plated steel or un-plated steel tools for dis-assembly or reassembly procedures described in this manual. Use of cadmium or zinc plated tools is not permitted since these platings are prone to chipping and flaking. Should these chips or flakes become embedded in aircraft parts, galvanic corrosion will result. Should these chips or flakes enter fuel or oil wetted components, they may eventually clog the filter or produce inter-granular attack of nickel or titanium base alloys at elevated temperature. All tools regardless of type plating should be serviceable and free of chipping. <br /><br />TC 3-04.7 <br />CAUTION <br />The use of cadmium- and zinc-plated tools on Army aircraft is prohibited. Use only chrome-plated steel or un-plated steel tools during dis-assembly or reassembly of aircraft components <br /><br />FAA, AC NO. 150/5380-5B <br />Shadowbox.
