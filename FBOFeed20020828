<DESC>GovWorks intends to award this requirement to BiTMICRO Networks, Inc. on a sole source basis, however all alternate quotes will be considered. The Flight Test Branch of RTTC will use this hardware in support of various missile test programs both on and off Redstone Arsenal. The purpose of this hardware is to develop a component of ROCIT referred to as Range in a Box. The Range in a Box provides a wireless downrange control and status capability that can be used at TA-1 or at any unimproved range. RTTC believes that no other manufacturer can provide this type of solid state disk storage solution due to the requirements to operate at -45 degrees C to 85 degrees and handle a 1,500G shock. These specifications are required for a successful design. Award to any other vendor other than BitMICRO Networks would require a redesign to meet the above requirements at a substantial duplication of costs that would not likely be recovered through open competition.

<DESC>The proposed contract listed here is an 8(a) Competitive procurement.  North American Industrial Classification (NAIC) is 233320, Standard industrial code is 1542 and the size standard is $28.5 million. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.  The project consist of renovating approximately 46,000 SF, approximately 16,00 SF for the clinic and 15,000 SF for the assisted living units, within the Scott Building that consists of 350,000 SF.  The Scott Building is mainly a dormitory building with 648 single rooms each with an attached bath and a walk-in closet.  For the clinic, the primary objective is to renovate some of the existing single rooms into outpatient facilities consisting of Reception/Administration, Primary Care, Urgent/Treatment, Dental, Eye, and Outreach Services.  For the assisted living, the primary objective is to renovate some of the existing rooms into handicap accessible rooms.  This will be accomplished by combining approximately 90 existing rooms into approximately 60 new enlarged accessible, assisted living rooms.  Some other existing rooms will be for administrative and recreational spaces to support the assisted living units.  The mechanical and electrical infrastructure for the renovated area is existing and located in the basement of the building.  Therefore, the installation of new plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical and communication systems are required to be tied into the existing building distribution systems. The existing building is eight stories high; only one-half of the first three floors will be occupied and functioning; therefore, minimizing the disruptions of the existing utilities, dust and noise control are required.   The entire Scott building was renovated in 1989, which included asbestos and lead paint removal and /or abatement.  Asbestos may still be encountered in enclosed existing pipe chases, which may be required to be abated prior to any pipe connections.  The project will be designed with commercial codes and standards.

<DESC>The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Survey Solutions, Inc. of Denver, CO for an Ashtech Z-Xtreme Global Positioning System (GPS) survey package to include a backpack configuration and on-the-pole rover configuration.  The proposed purchase is an addition to WAPA's existing GPS equipment inventory.   The equipment of other GPS manufacturers is not compatible with WAPA's current Ashtech inventory, and to purchase GPS equipment of a different manufacturer would require purchasing all new GPS equipment.  This would be a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through the process of competing the requirement. A solicitation document has not been prepared and this notice does not constitute a request for proposals.  Vendors who believe they have the capability to provide equipment which is compatible with WAPA's current Ashtech GPS equipment inventory are invited to submit a description of their product to Western Area Power Administration, PO Box 281213, Mail Stop A7100, Lakewood, CO 80228-8213.  In addition to the foregoing, vendors may submit descriptive literature, such as brochures, specification sheets, illustrations or other types of information to the agency.  All product information that is submitted must list the salient characteristics of the equipment.  Product information may also be faxed to (720) 962-7161.  This information must be received not later than September 6, 2002, 5:00 PM, Mountain Time Zone.  A determination to compete the requirement based upon this notice is solely within the Government's discretion.  The Government will not reimburse a vendor for costs incurred in responding to this announcement.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice:  The U.S. General Services Administration announces an opportunity to qualified construction firms interested in providing construction services for Repairs and Alterations to the Robert N. Giaimo Federal Building in New Haven, CT.

The Robert N. Giaimo Federal Building contains approximately 10,955 gross square meters (117,924 GSF) of interior space.  The facility consists of a seven story modern style building with a two-level underground parking garage with loading docks (approximately 50,000 GSF). The work within this project shall include, but not be limited to: Alterations to building fenestration (curtain wall) and refurbishing of the exterior fa?ade; upgrade of accessibility to meet the requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); Structural upgrades for current seismic and wind load requirements.  Additional components of the project include: alteration of egress balconies; renovation of all interior tenant areas, restrooms and lobbies; correction of code deficiencies; hazardous material mitigation/abatement; upgrading of all elevators; upgrading of plumbing, fire protection; mechanical, electrical and security systems equipment; 
The facility will be occupied throughout the project. Construction will be conducted in several phases to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. Approximately one floor shall remain vacant in order to facilitate this work.  The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on complex multi-phased occupied renovations & alterations. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $10 million dollars or more and/or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $10 million dollars or more that involve the removal of hazardous materials. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 30 months. This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the ?best value? to the Government in terms of price and technical merit,  and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.
The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
    phased/building occupied construction projects.
3  Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

<SUBJECT>59-- Request for comments to Draft Specification, Replacement to High Voltage Power Supply PP-7712/(V)2/G

<ARCHDATE>11172002

<DESC>NA Request comments for a draft specification prepared to support an upcoming solicitation for a replacement to the PP-7712/(V)2/G High Voltage Power Supply, (HVPS), (NSN 6130-01-156-0434, Part No. SM-F-990810).  The proposed acquisition will require the asse mbly of 9 preproduction samples and a production effort of at least 450 units over a 4-year life of a requirements contract.   Complete text of the draft  specification can be found at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil under U.S. Army Market Research Listings . The legacy HVPS was designed with late 1970s technology and is becoming increasing difficult to support.  The PP-7712/(V)2/G is used in the AN/TSC-85 and TSC-93 Satellite Communication Terminals.     The HVPS is an electronic assembly that converts 3-phase, 208 VAC, 47.5-63 Hz power into regulated DC output voltages.  It primarily provides high voltage DC power to a klystron tube that is in the High Power Amplifier (HPA) (AM-6701A/TSC).  The HVPS also provides HPA control/protection. The combination of the HVPS and HPA is used to amplify a low level FM-SHF signal and feed a parabolic antenna. Ideally, the desired replacement HVPS would have a basic configuration that is an off-the-shelf commercially available item thats been cost effectively modified to meet the specification.  Based on present solid-state digital technology, the Government is looking for a replacement that will have four times reliability of the PP-7712, (of which is 34,500 hrs) at half the legacys cost, ($47,000).  As such, those responding should determine wh ether the reliability requirement is realistic based on the anticipated unit cost.  As the HVPS will be exposed to a tactical environment, the perspective responders should determine if present technology could provide a HVPS that can handle the proposed t est requirements, without exceeding the unit cost goal.  For those interested in impending contractual effort, be aware that the HVPS Statement of Work (SOW) will include some of the following requirements: Delivery of nine (9) preproduction samples by Jun 03 Ability to handle a production schedule delivery of 12-30 units per month commencing during 2QFY04 Provide at least a 30-month warranty, with 24 hour CONUS and 48 hour OCONUS turn-around time Have the ability to furnish commercial manuals for operator use and repair information for the anticipated time when the HVPS is beyond warranty coverage.   Request comments (to the draft specification) by COB 18 Sep 02. POC, Tony Blais, anthony.blais@mail1.monmouth.army.mil, (732) 532-5038.

Auditory Steady State Responses: Can be reliable recorded in sleeping neonates and children. Are evoked by frequency specific tonal stimuli. Can be detected objectively using statistical algorithms. Thresholds that are highly correlated with behavioral audiogram thresholds. Can be used to estimate the behavioral pure tone audiogram. 
All ASSR information is shown in a single display. Continuous live display allows you to easily monitor the ongoing EEG signals. Electrode attachment integrity can be assessed with one-button, on-screen impedance measurement. Evoke the ASSR with AM/FM modulated tonal stimuli for the 250 ? 8k Hz frequency range. Objective ASSR detection using patented algorithms eliminates tester subjectivity and provides quality control. ASSR thresholds can be measured to 5dB accuracy. The behavioral audiogram is estimated using patented algorithms, and a confidence interval is calculated for each threshold. With one click on a button, change quickly between displaying individual trail results. ASSR threshold plots, and estimated audiograms. Preview reports on screen and print them in full size single page format in black and white or color.

Audera also records other auditory evoked potentials. Can assess both cochlear and retro-chcolear function with these additional AEP testing capabilities: Electrocochleography (ECochG). Auditory Middle Latency Responses (AMLR). Long Latency on Cortical Responses (LLR). 

AEP Software features includes: Click, tone pip and tone burst stimuli with contralateral masking available. No predefined limits on number of waveforms displayed. Multiple panels of wave forms displayed simultaneously. Continuous live display of ongoing input signals. Waveforms color-coded for ear of stimulation and amplifier recording channel. Multiple sets of test settings of protocols. Built in, one button electrode impedance measurement.

<DESC>NASA/KSC plans to issue a Sole-Source Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Remote Intelligent Monitoring System (RIMS). The system will be used as an interface tool for NASA system software for plant growth chambers called "The System for Automation of Growth Environment Research," (SAGER). NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Interface and Control Systems, (ICS)  Guilford Rd., Columbia, MD, in accordance with  the statutory authority 10 U.S. C. 2304 (d)(1)(B).  This is a sole-source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. ICS is the only known responsible source that can provide the software compatible with the SAGER interface. Award to any other contractor would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA requirements.	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing mail, fax, or email to Ms Teri N. Jackson not later than 12 NOON Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday, September 3, 2002.  The contact information is as follow: Mail, NASA/Kennedy Space Center, MC: OP-MS, Kennedy Space Center, FL, 32899; Fax: 321/867-2825; Email: teri.Jackson-1@ksc.nasa.gov.  Such=20 capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	 A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 The U.S. EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Wisconsin under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide a technical study entitled "Engineering Assessment of  Geosynthetic Clay Liners in Landfill Covers." The scope of this project includes the removal and laboratory analysis of landfill cover components to assess performance. The study will focus on monitoring the performance of cover systems where Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs) comprise a critical  element of the cover design. Data will be gathered and analyzed from GCLs in covers and recommendations for their future use will be based on results of this study.  This notice is not a request for quotations. U.S. EPA market research indicates the University of Wisconsin is the only known source  able to satisfy the Government's requirements. The University has the ability to conduct technical research activities, project planning, data gathering, data analysis and report writing regarding waste containment systems. Moreover, it is imperative that this task be completed in the shortest  possible time frame as the information to be uncovered will comprise an important part of EPA's understanding of landfill cover systems and is immediately useful for many designers and owners of waste containment facilities as well as state, local and tribal government officials considering design  proposals. The PhD researchers at the University of Wisconsin bring unique expertise gained in the execution of similar technical projects and are able to conduct this work within strict time parameters.  Interested parties may respond to this requirement by providing written documentation that  your firm possesses the ability to conduct research in this field of study. Such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice, which will expire at 5:00 PM EST, Friday, September 13, 2002.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13,  Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The applicable NAICS code is 541620. The anticipated award date is September 20, 2002. Interested parties should submit documentation in writing to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov)  referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-02-00257.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Total Frequency Company, 4120 Evans Drive, Boulder, CO for the periodic calibration, evaluation, repairs and upgrades of 14 special purpose synthesizers designed for cesium (Cs) atomic frequency standards on an as needed basis.  This work requires specialized training and knowledge in the area of low phase noise, state-of-the-art microwave frequency synthesis, especially methods of obtaining low broadband phase noise and extremely low long-term random walk of phase (RWPM) characteristics.  NIST is a leader in the design and construction of the frequency synthesizer that is used to generate rf signals and modulation for laboratory Cs frequency standards.  NIST has now completed and delivered synthesizers to other programs, primarily other primary standards laboratories, and new designs are under construction.  Because the operational mode and requirements of the various standards are different, some custom design changes have been made for almost every one of these synthesizers.  The synthesizers must be a repaired, calibrated, and tested to a level of internal fractional frequency stability of better than 1.5 x 10-15 at 10 s and 1 x 10-18 at 1 day with an estimated temperature coefficient of 0.1 ps to 0.5 ps/K for 5, 10, and 100 MHz relative to the Cs transition at 9.192 GHz.  Repairs and adjustments must be made to the limit of the very low short-term phase fluctuations inherent in regenerative and digital dividers.  A series of phase-locked loops must be optimized so that each synthesizer's spectral purity (PM noise) conforms to the measurement standards in the document "Microwave Synthesisers for Atomic Frequency Standards," by A. Sen Gupta, J. F. Garcia Nava, C. Nelson, D. A Howe, and F. L. Walls," in Proc. 6th Symposium on Frequency Standards and Metrology, St. Andrews, Scotland, Sept. 9 - 14, 2001.   The work requires use of the highly specialized, calibrated equipment available at the NIST Time and Frequency Laboratory in Boulder, CO.  There is no solicitation available.  Responses to this notice will be evaluated solely to determine whether or not a competitive acquisition for these services would be in the best interest of the Government.  Responses must specifically address qualifications to perform the tasks included in this notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.1 (NTE $100K).  The anticipated award date is September 23, 2002.

<DESC>1. The Project: NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support nautical charting and related products anywhere in the United States, except Alaska, to include the coastal and adjacent ocean areas of the United States and its possessions and territories, the Great Lakes, and other inland navigable waters. One five-year indefinite delivery contract, at an estimated $4 million per year, is scheduled for award in FY 2003 with performance of first work order commencing in summer 2003. This contract will be national in coverage, but other specific project area contracts may be used in addition to this contract. Work orders under this contract will consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water multibeam sounding data; 2) acquiring side scan sonar data; 3) acquiring vertical beam echosounder data; 4) determining positions and least depths on hazards to navigation; 5) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 6) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, velocity of sound in the water column, vessel motion correctors, bottom sediment samples, etc.); 7) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 8) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 9) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The final statement of work will tailor these specifications for each work order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.  Potential vendors are encouraged to review the technical specifications and a description of the deliverables before responding to this announcement. This contract will permit that a Government COTR or observer be present during shipboard operations.  If the contractor conducts vessel operations overnight, the contractor will be required to provide meals and accommodations to the Government COTR or observer.  2. Selection Criteria:  Firm must provide sufficient surveying vessel(s) and equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious prosecution of work assignments.  Participation by firms qualifying as small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small businesses will be one of the factors of consideration in the selection process.  To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in hydrographic surveying and demonstrated experience in surveying using shallow water multibeam sonar system, vertical beam echosounder, side scan sonar system and interpreting the data.  The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying.  Firms must show the availability of a suitable survey vessel(s) that complies with applicable U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, OSHA, and other federal regulations; data acquisition and processing systems; vertical beam echosounder system(s); shallow water multibeam sonar system(s) capable of detecting contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m high; side scan sonar system(s) that can detect a 1m x 1m x 1m target and with the capability to record data digitally; GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control; differential GPS equipment for vessel positioning; water level measurement gauges; and equipment for determining velocity of sound in the water column.

Evaluation criteria #6 will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b).  Responding firms are requested to state whether they are small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business in block 5 of the SF255. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project.  Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.  Specific abilities and disciplines required on this contract include (but are not limited to):  Project Manager, Hydrographer, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst).  Firms should indicate in Block 10 of their SF255 their experience using a shallow water multibeam survey system and an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA.  For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data.  The operating specifications of the shallow water multibeam system must be included.  3. Submission:  All responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA.  Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams.  Prime contractors shall submit SF-254s for each team member and subcontractor, plus a consolidated SF-255 for the entire team.  The SF-254s should reflect the overall capacity of each member of the team, whereas the SF-255 should reflect only those resources available for this effort.  Firms should submit three copies each of SF-254 and SF-255.  The evaluation factors must be addressed in block 10 of the SF-255.  Facsimile responses are not authorized.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure wildlife management services via herding of Canada Geese.  Due to the continuing  increase in the number of Canada geese on the 570 acre property located at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD,  NIST has a requirement for the services of  a trainer and registered, fully trained herding dog to restrict, minimize, and/or eliminate the presence of  the geese using standard herding practices.  No animals are to be harmed as a result of the dog's  activities.  The trainer and dog  must work effectively together to restrict  herding activities to only the geese.  Other wildlife on the site include deer, fox, groundhogs, raccoons, and a variety of  birds.  The contractor's objectives are to restrict the geese to the  areas immediately surrounding the ponds and wetland area to minimize goose/staff interaction around all buildings, walkways, and parking lots and to reduce the site-wide population to 100 Canada geese.  Herding services shall be conducted randomly on a weekly basis from several times per day to several times per week based on seasonal and migratory waterfowl practices, nesting periods, and/or nuisance activities.  The Contractor shall have sole ownership and responsibility for the dog(s) employed in this service.  Contractor must have an animal available to meet the requirements of this contract at all times (i.e., if primary animal is ill or injured, a backup must be available).  Contractor shall be responsible for  all shelter, care, transportation and veterinary services, and insurance.  As part of the evaluation process, offerors may be required to give an on-site demonstration of techniques to be utilized.  Evaluation will be based on the control of the animal by the handler and the responsiveness to command  in achieving the desired goal.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed price contract for a 12 month base year period with four one year option periods, if exercised.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation, SB1341-02-R-0005, is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about November 1, 2001 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.  Potential offers are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders lists will be maintained.  Potential offerors are required to direct all questions via email to Diane.Loeb@nist.gov.

SOLICITATION NUMBER TDA02-Q-073 
(NOTE: The Soliciation will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website SEPTEMBER 12, 2002)

Definitional Mission for Tourism Infrastructure Projects in Morocco

TDA is considering the provision of grant funds for feasibility studies in the tourism sector in Morocco.  TDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to analyze the proposed projects.
 
Tourism is not a sector in which TDA has broad experience.  Therefore, the selected Definitional Mission (DM) contractor will be asked to focus on infrastructure requirements and not luxury development.  For example, the infrastructure requirements may be the construction of a convention center complex near Mohammed V International Airport and/or the Casablanca's old medina.   

It is expected that the DM contractor will travel to Morocco no later than mid-October 2002.  The DM contractor will be required to review the projects mentioned above and identify other activities that could warrant TDA support.  Due to the presumed lack of English language capability on the part of the Moroccan project sponsors, the selected DM contractor will be required to have working-level proficiency in French.  Upon award of this contract, the DM contractor will spend one week researching the Moroccan tourism sector, as well as additional project information that may be identified, and prepare a pre-trip report to TDA.  Upon approval by TDA, the contractor will then travel to Morocco, spending seven (7) to ten (10) full business days in country to evaluate and identify opportunities, and prepare recommendations for TDA approval.  The contractor will prepare a final TDA report with a full review of all potential projects, paying particular attention to the likely interest of U.S. firms in these markets, and the projects' likelihood for financing and producing U.S. exports.  Terms of Reference prepared for feasibility studies recommended to TDA will incorporate the agency's emphasis on financing feasibility.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $30,000.00.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: Small business concerns for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA's purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Contractors planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation in no way obligates TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on/about (15) fifteen days after the publication date of this synopsis.  The company's size shall be stated within the company?s proposal.  DO NOT send email requests for the RFP.  The RFP will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website SEPTEMBER 12, 2002.  If the small businesses do not have electronic capabilities, send a fax request to Della Glenn at (703) 875-4009 or a letter by U.S. mail to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), Contracts Office, Room 200, 1621 N.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: RESTRICTED TO HAWAII AND GUAM 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII AND GUAM. (No solicitation will be available. This is an announcement that is open indefinitely.) The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from Hawaii and Guam 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program. (If you are currently a Hawaii or Guam-Based BOA Holder, no further action is required on your part.) BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the Hawaii and Guam BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii and Guam. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). The NAICS Sectors covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sectors 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military and government installations on the Islands of Hawaii, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. freely-associated island-nations of the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) Certification. (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (3) Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code Series 233, 234, and 235. (4) Provide resumes indicating the qualifications of key personnel of the Design-Build Team, if applicable, to include principals (design and construction), project manager (design and construction), registered professionals for each design discipline (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and fire protection engineer), and sustainable design consultant, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. Provide a narrative that describes the Design-Build Team?s internal communication system used to ensure a successful project, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. (5) Provide up to three references of completed projects within the last three years for EACH NAICS sector that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size and general scope and the possible complexity to which the firm would like to be considered. A request for a BOA may be denied if a contractor has an Experience Modifier Rate (EMR) greater than 1.2 and/or an incidence rate higher than 5.0. To register in the DOD CCR database, go to the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/, go to "Start New Registration", and follow the directions for registration. All requirements under the BOA Program will be offered via E-mail or posted on NAVFAC's Electronic Solicitation (E-Sol) website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing solicitation documents. All BOA holders are encouraged to visit the E-Sol website frequently for the solicitation documents issued under the BOA Program. All BOA holders shall create an account for each solicitation in which they wish to participate at the website http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil to ensure that they are notified of updates or amendments to the solicitation as they occur. No other notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors. BOAs will be processed in the order in which a complete evaluation package is received. BOAs will be used for competitive purposes. Unless you respond to this synopsis or subsequent synopses, which will be issued periodically, you will not be able to participate in this BOA program.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This is a Request for QUOTE (RFQ); a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Jefferson Laboratories, Arkansas Regional Laboratory (ARL), intends to purchase an Iodine Analysis System. Description of the system: This equipment is needed for the analysis of iodine (as iodide) in food samples that are a part of the Total Diet Analysis Program. The intended use for the equipment is to automate the analytical procedure that involves the iodine catalyzed reaction of arsenic and ceric. The automation of this procedure will provide a more efficient process as well as a more accurate procedure since every sample and standard will be handled exactly the same.
The following characteristics are required:
1. Non-segmented low flow rates to minimize the amount of waste arsenic generated and provide high throughput rates and complete washout characteristics.
2. Demonstrated ability of the instrument to measure iodine at ng (nanogram)/ml levels and agreement to refine any existing method to insure that it will work with Total Diet Sample digests.
3. System should provide an autosampler and the software necessary to dilute samples that are initially off scale and rerun the samples without operator intervention and to have the capability to automatically prepare working standard solutions from a stock standard solution
4. The instrument package should include but not be limited to the following:
XYZ Autosampler
A reagent pump
All the required software, data interface and A/D board
A computer, monitor and printer
An analytical channel designed specifically to assay iodine (as iodide)
An accessories kit
Operating manuals
               Installation and training 
Interested offeror?s shall submit technical capabilities, which may be descriptive literature, along with their cost quotation. APPLICABILITY OF FAR PROVISIONS.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference:   FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors ?

FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Quotations (Oct 1997).  FOB Destination within 45 days after award of a purchase order.  Descriptive literature shall be in sufficient detail as to demonstrate that the system offered meets or exceeds the specifications.  Award will be made to the vendor who submits a proposal that offer the Best Value to the Government in terms of technical ability and price (Apr 1984).   The Government may make its decision on the basis of initial quotations received and not have discussions.  Therefore each initial quotation should contain the offeror?s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  This is Request for Quote number R-4011-00-2-00.  Offers are due in this office no later than September 16, 2002, 2:00p.m., local prevailing time.

An official authorized to bind the Offeror must sign the terms and conditions of the offer.  Offerors that fail to finish required representation and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.*****.

The following is provided for all prospective offerors:
Q1. My question is whether the technique applied by the system is mandated as non-segmented flow analysis, or would other techniques be considered?

A1.	In order to determine whether or not other systems would work we would have to have some type of samples and at the levels we are assaying.  Please submit descriptive data along with quotation.

<DESC>This is a compilation of questions received and answered for the subject solicitation:

(1) Are the AKR-10D-50 circuit breakers manually operated or electrically operated?
  Electrically operated, but would like manual controls too, if possible. 

(2) If the AKR-10D-50 breakers are electrically operated, please provide the voltage of the motor and control coils.  (If the breakers are manually operated this information will not be necessary).
  [  Charging motor and close coil is 120 Volts AC. Trip coil is 24 volt DC.
 
(3) Is the awardee required to perform any on-site work?  It appeared to me that the breakers should be shipped by the awardee to the Lackland AFB site and that air force personnell will be installing the circuit breakers into the switchgear.
  This is correct. CEMIRT personnel will be doing the installation. The contract awardree only needs to deliver the items to the site.
 
(4) Are the "blank" cubicles ready to accept AKR-10D-50 circuit breakers, i.e. are the blank cells equipped with drawout rails and primary disconnecting assemblies so that the breakers can be racked in without any cubicle modifications?
  After reviewing the Form 9s and the work order folder the answer is NO. We need the cubicle receptacles (cans) and all racking mechanisms, and whatever else is needed to accommodate the circuit breakers. CEMIRT will do the installation and wiring of the existing switchgear.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure wildlife management services via herding of Canada Geese.  Due to the continuing  increase in the number of Canada geese on the 570 acre property located at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD,  NIST has a requirement for the services of  a trainer and registered, fully trained herding dog to restrict, minimize, and/or eliminate the presence of  the geese using standard herding practices.  No animals are to be harmed as a result of the dog's  activities.  The trainer and dog  must work effectively together to restrict  herding activities to only the geese.  Other wildlife on the site include deer, fox, groundhogs, raccoons, and a variety of  birds.  The contractor's objectives are to restrict the geese to the  areas immediately surrounding the ponds and wetland area to minimize goose/staff interaction around all buildings, walkways, and parking lots and to reduce the site-wide population to 100 Canada geese.  Herding services shall be conducted randomly on a weekly basis from several times per day to several times per week based on seasonal and migratory waterfowl practices, nesting periods, and/or nuisance activities.  The Contractor shall have sole ownership and responsibility for the dog(s) employed in this service.  Contractor must have an animal available to meet the requirements of this contract at all times (i.e., if primary animal is ill or injured, a backup must be available).  Contractor shall be responsible for  all shelter, care, transportation and veterinary services, and insurance.  As part of the evaluation process, offerors may be required to give an on-site demonstration of techniques to be utilized.  Evaluation will be based on the control of the animal by the handler and the responsiveness to command  in achieving the desired goal.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed price contract for a 12 month base year period with four one year option periods, if exercised.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation, SB1341-02-R-0005, is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about November 1, 2001 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.  Potential offers are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders lists will be maintained.  Potential offerors are required to direct all questions via email to Diane.Loeb@nist.gov.

<DESC>NA .  The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for the installation of an existing borehole instrumentation package in the Long Valley Exploratory Well (LVEW) located in center of the Long Valley Caldera in eastern California. This instrument will be permanently installed and will serve as a deep scientific observatory within the Long Valley Observatory monitoring network. This requirement is the final stage of an International Continental Deep Drilling Project that was initiated in 1985. The USGS intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to Sondi and Consultants to perform this installation. To the best of our knowledge Sondi and Consultants is the only known source that has access to the required 55 degree tilt HQ bore hole instrument and 3 pair twisted shielded with drain wire and external armor cabling system. This instrument is capable of detecting near field effects of micro-earthquakes. This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures. All sources who believe that they can obtain this instrument package and associated cabling may submit a capability statement within 10 days from the date of this announcement. See numbered note 22.*****

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) for an anticipated procuremen= t project to revamp the mail distribution activities at Memorial Programs Services, Washington, DC.  The acquisition team for this project is presently conducting market research into all possibilities of revamping this function.  Contractors interested in participating by providing feedback:  recommendations, questions, solutions, etc concerning this project should send their comments, name, address, phone number, fax number and email addresses to:  Diane Campbell, Contracting Officer; Department of Veterans Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, Centralized Contracting Division (402D31), 5105 Russell Road, Quantico, VA 22134-3903.  The following is a brief description of the objectives of this project: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), National Cemetery Administration, Memorial Programs Service (MPS) is currently seeking ways to contract out it's mailroom and document imaging operations.  These operations, to be performed at a contractor's facility within a 50-mile radius of Washington, DC, include: =20  *picking up mail delivered to VA facilities in Washington, DC  *setting up a new mailing address, and accepting delivery of US Postal Service mail on behalf of MPS  *opening, date stamping and sorting all incoming mail  *converting documents to electronic images for delivery to VA in a format compatible with the VA Information Systems currently being used by MPS to process and manage the documents (see below)  *developing and implementing a quality control methodology  *storing and disposing of paper documents  *providing daily, weekly and monthly management reports. =20 =20  It is estimated that 1,108,000 documents will require processing during the first year.=20 Electronic images forwarded to MPS will be received by the Systems Integration Center (SIC).  Technical representatives from the SIC will assist the contractor in developing the transfer methodology.  Due to an increase in security regulations placed on non-government elements in accessing federal systems it has not been determined at this time what form of file transfer will be utilized for this initiative.  One of the intents for this RFI is to establish the methodology that would eventually be implemented to accomplish this goal.  Security, cost and efficiency of the process are the major areas of interest.=20 The following is a general overview of the data criteria required for the contractor to provide a format compatible with the VA Information Systems currently being used by MPS. The terms =91Bin=92 and =91Batch=92 wi= ll be used periodically. The term =91Bin=92 is used instead of file directory.  A =91Bin=92 is a file directory that will hold the stored images (batches) that are scanned. A piece of mail (one envelope) may include one or more pages.  The content of each envelope is considered a =91Batch=92 after it has been scanned. Each batch will contain one or more images which coincide with the number of pages contained in the original envelope. Mail that is to be converted to image will be categorized prior to the transfer to MPS.  There are three categories of mail. These categories include the =93Presidential Memorial Certificates=94,=20 =931330 Applications for a Headstone or Marker=94 and the third category =93Other=94.  =20 Mail which falls under the category of =93Other=94 will be scanned and transferred to MPS in one bin. The two remaining categories of mail to process will require a preliminary review of each piece to determine what =91Bin=92 the image should be stored.  There are approximately 12 Bins that will exist.  One of these is the PMC bin.=20 All PMC correspondence will be placed in this bin.  The remaining bins will be used for storing the last category =931330 Applications for a Headstone or Marker=94.  Visual inspection of the mail will determine which =93Bin=94 each should be placed (scanned). The file format of these images will be =91TIFF=92.  A determination on the use of a multi-page or single page tiff for each =91piece=92 of mail will be made after responses / comments to the RFI have been received. Maintaining the integrity of the batch is of great importance. An envelope that contains 5 pages must be linked in some manner so that only one page would have to be viewed for the purpose of forwarding / processing all 5 pages.=20 As previously stated the solution shall provide a file transfer format compatible with the VA Information Systems currently being used by MPS to process and manage the documents.  The purpose of this RFI is to allow contractors to provide alternative processing methods for the delivery of these mail images to the VA that meet the required criteria.  Minimizing the changes VA IT resources would be required to make to the existing systems will enhance the attractiveness of the proposal. The benefit MPS is looking to experience by maximizing the compatibility of the file transfer is they will not require additional staff to =91screen=92 the images before they are moved to the production storage platform within the SIC.=20 The current scanning process utilizes software that creates a text file for each scanned batch. This text file contains a list of the associated tiff files and the bin that the batch is to be stored. This text file is processed by an existing VA imaging system.  The tiff files listed in the text file are then stored in the appropriate bin. A solution that provides this compatibility would require limited SIC resources to implement and would not require additional MPS staff.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED REQUESTING A BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION.  THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION!  IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY OF ANY FUTURE PROCUREMENT, IF ANY, THAT MAY ARISE FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT WILL NOT BE GIVEN AND NO APPOINTMENTS FOR PRESENTATIONS WILL BE MADE.
NFESC has been involved with the development of a mobile Containerized Assembled Wash Facility (CAWF) for US Marine Corps vehicles.  The CAWF has a wash stage, transition stage for inspection, and a rinse stage.   After the rinse stage an anticorrosion inhibitor will be applied.  In the final design, the CAWF will recycle the water from the wash and rinse stages.    It is anticipated that the wash water will be high in total dissolved solids (TDS) from the vehicles being exposed to sea water as well as road contaminants. Reverse osmosis has been the mainstay of the US military water purification units.  However, the CAWF requirements may be better served with emerging separation technologies such as, but not limited, to nanoflitration, capacitive deionization, alternating current electrocoagulation.  In this Sources Sought, NFESC is seeking innovative recycle technologies with the following specifications:   (1) low pressure  <1000 psig, 2) small skid size of less 150 cubic feet, 3)  lightweight < 1500 lbs, 4) process >40 gpm of permeate water, 5) remove corrosive contaminants such as chloride and sulfate, and reduce TDS between 50-500 mg/l levels.  The technology must be able to operate at pH < 3 due to various derusting/deoxidizing agents in the rinse stage such as phosphoric, citric, sulfuric, and hydrochloric acid; also hydrogen peroxide.  In addition, it is required that no hazardous chemicals be used for operation, be resistant to biofouling, have minimal pretreatment stages, and capable of sensor integration.  Maintenance on the wash/rinse water recycle system must be minimal during field operations (~ 6-12 months duration) with replacement parts commercially available outside the US.   It is anticipated that twenty (20) CAWF?s will be built for the US Marine Corps Pre-positioning Ships (MPS), training facilities, and permanent stations.  A prototype CAWF unit was employed for decontamination of the trucks hauling debris away for the World Trade center.   Follow-on of CAWF units will have potential of being supplied to critical emergency centers for Homeland Defense.  All proprietary information not to be disseminated in Government documents must be clearly identified.  Interested sources must submit their qualifications/capabilities in writing to NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND CONTRACTS OFFICE, CODE NF23, BLDG. 41, NAVFACENGCOMDET-NFI, 3502 GOODSPEED STREET, SUITE 2, PORT HUENEME, CA 93043-4337.  DEADLINE for receiving responses is September 26, 2002.  Responses received after the deadline or without the required information shall be considered unacceptable and will not be considered.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.
