<DESC>The National Library of Medicine is currently considering adding additional funding and extending several existing research and development contracts awarded under Application of Advanced Network Infrastructure in Heath and Disaster Management. The assessment and decision to continue and/or add funding to any of the contracts is solely at the discretion of the National Library of Medicine. The contracts were created under an initiative to demonstrate the application of scalable, network aware, wireless, GIS, and identification technologies to a networked health related environment. The research focuses on situations that will require or greatly benefit from the application of these technologies in health care, medical decision-making, public health, large-scale health emergencies, health education, biomedical, clinical, and health services research. Each project involves the use of test bed networks linking hospitals, clinics, the health practitioners' offices, patients' homes, health professional schools, medical libraries, universities, medical research centers and laboratories, and/or public health authorities, to demonstrate revolutionary applications in healthcare, health education, and medical research. These significant, network dependent healthcare, health education or research applications will demonstrate one or more of the following capabilities: 1) Self-scaling applications; 2) Self-optimizing end-to-end network aware real-time applications and/or middleware; 3) Wireless applications; 4) Nomadic application and/or applications using geographic information systems (GIS) techniques; and 5) Applications which involve advanced identification methodologies, e.g., biometrics or smartcards. These test beds shall be designed to yield insight into three realms: first, the biomedical and social value of the proposed test bed services to the individuals served; second, insight into the potential value of these services to the health delivery, public health or health education enterprise, or homeland defense initiative; and third, insight into particular elements of future advanced network capabilities or network specifications that are required for support of these capabilities. Projects may range from being small in scope requiring small amounts of funding to very broad in scope requiring larger amounts of additional funding. This is not a request for proposals. Only existing research and development contracts awarded under Application of Advanced Network Infrastructure in Heath and Disaster Management are being considered.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER for The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Program Services (OPS).

The purpose of the project is to obtain performance outcomes from a pilot homelessness prevention program being conducted by the Coalition for the Homeless in the District of Columbia.  Specifically the outcomes would address whether dispute resolution/conflict mediation is effective when applied at the moment of shelter entry as an intervention to forestall homelessness for those at imminent risk of losing their housing and does it help clients create plans that will prevent homelessness and reduce the length of shelter stays.

Homelessness has been a SAMHSA priority since its inception.  SAMHSA supports programs to assist people with mental illness or substance abuse who are homeless in obtaining treatment and other crucial services, such as primary health care, mental health and/or substance abuse treatment, housing, legal assistance, entitlements, and other supports, to assist them in making the transition from homelessness.

SAMHSA would like to develop the evidence based on the implementation and outcomes of dispute resolution and conflict mediation and track over a brief period of time the outcomes individuals experience who receive the services.    

The project has two components:  collection and analysis of information on all 50 individuals receiving the services and more in-depth information on services received and the immediate and longer-term outcomes of the process for a sub-sample of the individuals.  The project will be conducted over a seven month period. 

Interested parties possessing these required capabilities should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor?s name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor?s Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small business concerns (including small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, etc.) are encouraged to review this notice.  E-mail capability statement to bjmiller@psc.gov, referencing the Pre-solicitation Number 07M000150 in the subject.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any requests for solicitation packages will be disregarded.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER for The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services.

SAMHSA, through the Mental Health Transformation States Incentive Grants (MH-TSIG), is interested in transforming systems related to mental health. Specifically, they intend to perform a collaborative effort to increase quality improvement capacity and to test, disseminate knowledge about, and provide technical assistance and leadership on quality improvement practices for mental health and substance use health care in public- and private-sector settings. Over the past five years, the contractor has utilized a learning collaborative approach and focused on five key principles that distinguish successful from unsuccessful change organizations. The five principles are: (1) understand and involve the customer, (2) fix key problems, (3) pick a powerful change leader, (4) seek ideas from outside the organization and (5) use rapid-cycle change to establish effective change. The first two principles seek to understand what it is like to be a customer of the organization and to identify key problems that if addressed with significantly impact the organization. 
This project, through site visits and interviews, will seek to understand customer needs and identify opportunities for the application of process improvement to impact key state and organizational issues related to access and retention. CMHS is interested in how process improvement can be integrated into the TSIG infrastructure to help transform the systems of care. 
This knowledge and information will be utilized to tailor the agenda of an initial one-day training that focuses on the opportunities to address the key issues related to access and retention. Specifically, the learning collaborative meeting will introduce the NIATx approach. It will also provide attendees with peer case examples that highlight of the application of process improvement to overcome obstacles to access and retention. (For example, the use of rapid-cycle changes to reduce the time from first contact to the first therapy appointment by 54 percent, from 26 to 12 days, and to increase the number of admissions from 33 to 78). 
The introductory process improvement meeting will also teach attendees about the power of the client walk-through and will and encourage them to conduct one after the meeting.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for Network Appliance components.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements for Department of State infrastructure interoperability and connectivity with mission critical communications systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Network Appliance products as a key component of the Departments core Microsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure on OpenNet.  The equipment listed above is required to support continuing operations of the Departments Enterprise E-Mail systems.  The current Network Appliance systems provide storage for over 14,000 user mailboxes.  This acquisition will allow MSO to support the Departments IRM Bureau consolidation efforts and provide storage for over 14,000 user mailboxes.  This acquisition will allow MSO to support he Departments IRM Bureau consolidation efforts and provide storage for 40,000 users (25,000 on OpenNet) This will also enable MSO to provide increased storage space for users  500 MB mailboxes vs. current mailbox size for users, which is restricted to 100 MB.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO have committed to a shared platform at a common alternate site for disaster recovery capability based upon Network Appliance technology. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by bran name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments core Microsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure.  Network Appliance provided hardware, software, and services provide support for current E-Mail Central Site operations.  Network Appliance systems are tightly integrated with Microsoft Exchange and integrate seamlessly into the Departments networking infrastructure.  Therefore, Network Appliance has a thorough understanding of Microsoft Exchange and the Departments optional requirements.  No other supplier possesses this level of capability and understanding.  Acquisition of storage systems from any other supplier would involve substantial risk in the areas of quality and continuity of operations, cost for maintaining current operations, and schedule for deployment of Central Site consolidation capabilities.  Furthermore, SMART and MSO will be able to exploit a common platform based upon Network Appliance architecture and systems for disaster recovery.  Economies of scale gained through the use of this common, shared platform for disaster recovery will result in savings of $1M to $3M for the Department.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) intends to issue a contract, for a base period and two one-year options, on a sole source basis, to Metvante Corporation (formerly TREEV LLC.), 4900 W. Brown Deer Road, Milwaukee, WI  53223-2459, for the renewal of software licenses and maintenance associated with the Computer Output to Laser Disc (COLD) System.  The software portion of the COLD System was developed by TREEV LLC. and designed for certain types of hardware infrastructures.  There are several mission critical applications in BPD that have been programmed in conjunction with Metavante to utilize COLD specifically.  Any changes to this code need to be coordinated with the programmers at Metavante in order to make necessary coding changes to the COLD software.  Additionally, historical storage platters and accessing them requires Metavante expertise in previous software versions.  Metavante's knowledge and understanding of its own software's default and custom developed interaction with z/OS and Windows based operating systems cannot be match by an outside source.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 PM EST on August 6, 2007.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole-source award to Metavante Corporation.

A public solicitation will not be available. This notice satisfies the requirement of FAR Part 5 for publicizing contract opportunities. Firms wishing to challenge the sole-source decision must submit a letter of interest, referencing No. DE-AF52-07NA28293, to DOE demonstrating the firms ability to provide the equivalent items as described above.

There is no other known contractor that is able to develop a wide range of instructional materials and resources; and that is able to demonstrate, through prior experience:  building capacity at Tribal colleges and universities through specialized curriculum development which is focused on Federal government regulations; that has demonstrated recent experience in implementing specialized curriculums instruction to full time facility; that has demonstrated recent experience in conducting intense on-site and distance learning that includes modern training tools and techniques that address these curriculums and present them to a culturally specific group with sovereign nation status; and that is able to demonstrate recent instructional designs that achieve results establishing technical reference centers for the American Indian Tribes, Consortiums, and EPA that provide current, specific assistance to American Indians involved with applying for, and managing, assistance agreement  s.   NPETE will convert EPA?s Tribal Administrative and Financing training manual, using SCORM compliant web based software, into a student technical manual; develop an instructor manual suitable for use in workshop format, academic classes and in a unit platform to be converted to web based and interactive video training courses; provide research and editorial services to ensure EPA?s tribal training materials are current; establish on-line training course that will be offered to tribes; and develop a plan for EPA to present all the training and technology to each of the 34 Tribal Colleges and Universities to include the training in their Tribal and Public Administration courses.  The contractor will also develop an interactive website to link tribal college technical business centers, disseminate information, provide for a training calendar by location, and provide links to other resource sites.   Ultimately, this contractor support will lead to the establishment of technical business centers at three Tribal Colleges and Universities that will provide training services to Tribes and Tribal organizations.

<DESC>COMNAVAIRSYSCOM is seeking information from potential suppliers regarding the H-46E torque indicating system.  The torque indicating system provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot.  The system consists of six torque sensors, two temperature compensators, two signal conditioners and two torquemeter indicators.  Inaccuracies in the existing torque indicating system have resulted in unnecessary maintenance and parts replacement.  Also, support equipment required to maintain the torque indicating system has become obsolete and is no longer procurable.  The new torque indicating system will incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that resembles the existing torquemeter indicator.  Minimal new support equipment will be required and the requirement for existing torque test sets will be eliminated.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This sources sought synopsis is seeking information from sources that are capable of manufacturing torque indicating systems.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis should be in the form of a technical approach that outlines processes needed to ensure that all aspects of a torque indicating systems engineering methodology are used in the execution of the program.  At a minimum, (1) the new torque indicating system will be compatible and integrated with existing H-46E equipment; (2) meet or exceed accuracy of the H-46E onboard aircraft integrated maintenance system (AIMS); (3) resemble the current H-46E torquemeter indicator; (4) provide torque signal validity; (5) require minimal peculiar support equipment for maintenance; (6) have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) combine functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes existing location on both the pilot and copilot consoles.  Due to the urgency of the need and the need for the torque instrumentation to interface with other on board systems, the Contractor shall possess recent H-46E engine instrument development experience for this effort.  It is requested that all interested parties submit a capability statement/documentation (under 25 pages) specifically addressing the technical approach to be taken to satisfy their statement of work tasking, potential teaming arrangements, related past performance, general corporate information, and their business size.  TELEPHONE REPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING (i.e. fax, email, or letterhead).  All responses will be kept confidential and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any proposal preparation costs associated with responding to this synopsis.  Proprietary Data in the responses will be protected where so designed.  All responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (Noon) Eastern Standard Time on 10 Aug 2007.  All responses must be submitted to the Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Julie Paul, Code: AIR-2.4.3.3.2., Bldg. # 2272, Suite 353, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Email address:  Julie.Paul@navy.mil; Telephone Number (301) 757-6570; FAX (301) 757-9039.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis, Microarray analysis of NSAIDs-induced genes in human vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, microarrays, and data analysis with GenUs Biosystems, Inc. 1808 Janke Drive Northbrook, IL 60062.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The purpose of this requirement is to provide full service Microarray analysis on normal cardiovascular cells using the CodeLink technology. The study, ?Microarray analysis of NSAIDs-induced genes in human vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, is in conjunction to an earlier microarray study. 

GenUs Biosystems, Inc is the only source known to the NCI that can provide Microarray analysis using the CodeLink technology.  In order to be able to expand and complete the ongoing research using this technology, the micro-array analysis must be compatible with previous experiments. In addition, GenUS Biosystems, Inc is the only accredited, certified commercial provider of the General Electric (GE) CodeLink bioarray services.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current Microarray analysis being performed in the NCI laboratory.

Benefit

The results of such studies, as mentioned above, are expected to yield new information regarding gene expression changes in cancer cells and normal cells in response to  drugs used in the treatment of cancer. Understanding signals that lead from the cellular network that regulates growth to the genetic material may help clarify the differential sensitivity of particular cells to specific drugs.  Proteins that convey those regulatory signals might serve as targets for the development of novel, safe and specific anti-cancer drugs.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>Statement of Work for Medical Contract 1.  Introduction and Scope of Work:  This requirement is needed because the demand for Occupational Therapy services at the VA New Jersey Healthcare System, East Orange and Lyons campus exceeds the current level of staffing required to meet the expectations of both internal and external customers.

The staff occupational therapist is responsible for delivering Occupational Therapy services, as prescribed by the physician, to all types of illness and disabilities found in the acute care inpatient and outpatient settings at East Orange and the nursing home, outpatient, and mental health settings at Lyons, using evaluations and treatments that promote positive outcomes through goal achievement.  The mission of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service (PM&amp;RS) at the VA New Jersey Healthcare System is to provide comprehensive rehabilitation care to the veteran patient utilizing an interdisciplinary team approach using the state of the art equipment and procedures, in order to return the veteran back to the community in the highest level of independent function, and better quality of life.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The project is likely to receive a very intense level of scrutiny within the basin.  MRERP will address ecosystems needs of the longest river in the United States.

(see following sections for details) PROFESSIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS In addition to the scope of work outlined in this document, the appraisal/consultation exercise is to be prepared in conformance with 49 C.F.R.24 and other applicable requirements, including, to the extent appropriate: the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition (UASFLA aka The Yellow Book http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/ ) except as modified by EC 405-1-04; the current edition of the Appraisal Foundation's Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP  http://www.apprai salfoundation.org ) except as modified by EC 405-1-04; and the applicable laws or public policy. REPORT TYPE The report must be credible and performed in a manner commensurate with that of the Contractors peers for an assignment of this type. All relevant methods of analysis shall be performed, sufficient data collected and analyzed, and a written report that fu lly describes the elements to be Self-Contained in format. DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE Market Value as defined in UASFLA should be utilized in all appraisal assignments.  Here, the assignment is to establish fair market rental rate, thus a variation of the definition would be: The fair rent al value of a property is the amount which, in a competitive market, a well-informed and willing lessor would accept for the temporary use and enjoyment of the property.   CONTACTOR QUALIFICATIONS The Contract Appraiser must be a state licensed Certified General Real Estate Appraiser or have an equivalent Reciprocal License to practice real estate appraising in the State of which the real property is located; be in Good Standing with the State and  Federal Regulatory Licensing Agencies; and  meet the Competency Rule of USPAP as it applies to this appraisal assignment. SCOPE OF WORK Major components of the assignment would include, but not necessarily be limited to:  a) inspection of subject and understanding of the terms of the proposed lease (rental amount proposed by the Port will be disclosed to the contractor) and the basis upon which it is derived;  b) research market for competing facilities in the Portland area, including the subject Port of Portland facilities (and perhaps Southwestern Washington as well depending on the quantity of data available) and establish comparables consisting of space avai lable offerings and actual existing comparables leases;  c) analyze and establish market rent for the subject.  Although a consultation/rental survey assignment, the work product and report are expected to substantially comply with USPAP and UASFLA standards.  Furthermore, the contractor shall pay special attent ion to the following: 1) Both prospective lessor and lessee agree that the existing vacant warehouse on site will not be used for storage purposes other than vehicle parking, and thus no rental amount due other than the underlying land area. 2) There are certain improvements to the lease area required prior to occupancy such as a portable office building, water and sewer lines, shore power, etc. (see list).  It is intended that the cost of these improvements will be initially borne by the Port , and subsequently charged back to the lessee (perhaps prorated over the anticipated 5 year term of the lease).  The significance to the appraisal/consultation assignment is to identify the items on this list, if any, that typically are included in similar  lease arrangements.  In other words, the lessee will pay the cost of improvements only if the item is not typically included in the base rent. For the extra items required by the lessee, an appraisal/valuation is not required under this assignment (reas onableness of the actual costs of construction will be separately audited by the client). 3)  The draft lease agreement contains a provision that usage of the berths for tying up of vessels will not be exclusive to the lessee.  When the lessees vessels are not in port, the Port retains the prerogative to sublease the berthing space to other vessels on a transient basis.  While this arrangement may be typical of similar facilities, the rental survey needs to address its affect on market rent accordingly. 4)  For industrial/commercial moorage, the ability of a facility to accommodate vessels of certain depth/draft is significant. 5)  Contributory rental value of the land area shall be broken out from the total rent estimated.      DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY The subject real property proposed to be leased include approximately 4.2 acres of land area and approximately 700 lineal feet of dock space along Berths 203 and 204 at the Port of Portland Terminal 2.  Terminal 2 is located at 3556 NW Front Avenue, Portla nd, OR 97209.  The tax parcel for the portion under the proposed lease is 1N1E20-0800.  There is an existing vacant warehouse on site that is to be excluded from the rent estimate (see scope of work instructions in the preceding section).  In addition, cer tain tenant improvements will be installed by the lessor and charged back to the lessee (see list, and see scope of work instructions in the preceding section).  A portable office trailer is proposed to be rented and installed on si te, with the rental amount paid by the lessee.  Please see photo and map for depiction of the subject.  Complete legal description and final proposed lease agreement to be provided upon award of appraisal contract. OSTENSIBLE OWNERSHIP The property owner of record is: Port of Portland.  The Point-of-Contact is Lorali Sinnen, Property Manager II, (503) 944-7538. PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP AND/OR CLIENT/INTENDED USER RELATIONSHIPS Descriptive disclosure is required within the appraisal report of any previous Appraiser  Client/Intended User/Ownership/Advocate relationship, and/or appraisal assignment, real estate consultation services performed on the subject property by the Apprais er and/or their firm or affiliates.  If the Appraiser had a previous relationship and/or appraised the subject property for the Property Owner/Seller/Occupant/Tenant/Intended User in this transaction, the Appraiser is to notify the Client immediately prior  to acceptance of any contract for services for possible disqualification of appraisal services in this transaction. HIGHEST AND BEST USE The report shall contain a highest and best use analysis concluding to a specific highest and best use as if vacant and if improved, as improved.  The UASFLA requires the highest and best use analysis to make a Larger Parcel determination, and the va luation to be based on economic principles. For this assignment, the Highest and Best use analysis may be an abbreviated notation because of the apparent nature of the shipping terminals highest and best use.  The larger parcel analysis is also unnecessar y in this instance. HYPOTHETICAL CONDITIONS and/or EXTRAORDINARY ASSUMPTIONS See Scope of Work section above.  At this time, the Client is unaware of any other Hypothetical Conditions or Extraordinary Assumptions required for this appraisal/consultation assignment.  If the Appraiser should become aware of needed changes or modifica tions to this assumption, he/she shall notify the Corps of Engineers Point of Contact for discussion and concurrence on how to proceed. APPRAISER COORDINATION WITH PROPERTY OWNER(S) FOR INSPECTION The Appraiser is required to make a personal, physical property inspection and the Property Owner(s), or his/her designated representative, is to be given the opportunity to accompany the Appraiser on the subject property inspection.  A description of the notification and extent of effort to contact and arrange for the opportunity for the Property Owner(s) to accompany the Appraiser at the time of the inspection of the subject property is to be included in the report.   SCHEDULING The report shall be submitted no-later-than thirty-five (35) calendar days after the contract is awarded by the Seattle District Contracting office.  Note:  It should be understood, that the contracting process can take up to thirty (30) days itself, prior  to the awarding of the contract.

S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle Distri ct, Technical Resources Branch, CENWS-RE-TR P. O. Box 3755, Seattle, Washington, 98124-3755.

If the initial product submitted for review is deemed not acceptable, the Review Appraiser is to communicate and work with the Appraiser to the greatest extent possible t o facilitate the Appraiser's development of an acceptable product, and the contractor agrees to be appropriately responsive and cooperative.

For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systemsThis action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1.<BR><BR>For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. 	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  	Block updates  By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.  	Image commonality  By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure.

The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and  performing all labor required to install steam lines in Area B, MH S-227  to S-173A, to included excavation of approximately 1500 cubic yards of  hard material (Project 040006); replace steam lines from facility 20027 to  S-227 (Proejct 960082-2); and replace steam lines from Facility 20770 to  S-202, to include excavation of approximately 140 cubic yards of hard  material (Project 061989).  The scope will also include associated  architectural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications.  The  estimated price range is between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $13M.  This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in  accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program  Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in  the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations  issued after 31 May 1998.

Every solicitation  issued after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004,  "Required Central Contractor Registration. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: A mechanical contractor with experience in  installing Steam/HTHW piping, valves, expansion joints is required.

Projects 061989 and 9600822 can't be worked concurrently.  This is a relatively short work performance window for a contract with  multiple critical tasks that must be completed in order for the heating  system to be fully operational in time for the heating season.  It is  vital that the steam/heat to the affected facilities be available at the  start of the winter season.  Over half of the facilities in Area B will be  impacted, to include AFIT, Material Labs, Bio-Medical Center, Computer  Center, and the Avionics laboratories.  A highly experienced mechanical  contractor with extensive experience in steam piping is required because  no time extensions can be given to repair this critical utility system.

Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  








The Technical Evaluation Factors are:

V. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business, however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  The GSA goals for subcontracting are as follows: small businesses at least 41% of total subcontracting planned; small disadvantaged businesses at least 12% of small business subcontracting planned and small women-owned businesses at least 5% of small business subcontracting planned.

The vendor may be asked to provide approximately 4-6  presentations to the EPA's management chain.   
7. How long are the above presentations and what topics are you looking for?  Do you want customized topics or pre-developed topics?  The expected length of presentations is approximately 1-2 hours.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE FIELD ACTIVITY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE DIRECTORATE 
APPLIED BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE 

I. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Defense Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA) Behavioral Science Directorate solicits new proposals for its 4th Qtr fiscal year 2007 and FY 2008 contract program of applied research in behavioral and social science. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued per FAR 35.106.  A formal Request for Proposal will not be issued.  

The CIFA contracting officer will not issue paper copies of this announcement. CIFA reserves the right to select for award and to fund all, some, or none of the full proposals received in response to this solicitation.  No funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs will be allowed.  Technical and cost proposals, or any other material, submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  CIFA will adhere to FAR policy on handling source selection information and proprietary proposals.  It is the policy of CIFA to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information, and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. 

Awards, if any, will take the form of contracts.  In the event an offeror is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), Department of Energy National Laboratory, or other Federally funded entity, the CIFA contracting officer will work with the appropriate sponsoring agency to issue an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1531) or other appropriate authority.  

II. OVERVIEW

The purpose of the research is (1) to develop, test and evaluate the application (translation) of known principles and findings of the behavioral and social sciences to enhancing capabilities relevant to current and future intelligence, counter-intelligence, and human intelligence collection; and (2) to understand threats to national security in terms of the principles and methods of the social and behavioral sciences.  A portion of the funding may be made available for meritorious proposals from minority institutions and historically Black colleges and universities, and these entities are encouraged to participate.  

No consideration can be given to purely fundamental (basic) research projects (e.g., mechanisms of memory, affect or performance).  However, support will be given to projects that have both basic and applied components; for example, where investigations in laboratory settings help us to understand specific complexities in the field, or where basic and applied approaches are directed concurrently at the same problem.  

Each proposal will be evaluated by a government technical team in accordance with the criteria established herein.  Those proposals determined to be responsive to the BAA, receive high technical ratings and are identified as complementing current research in service to ongoing CIFA operations will be given priority for funding.  Proposals that are responsive and receive high technical ratings may also be funded but will generally be given a lower priority.

CIFA Behavioral Sciences Directorate

The Mission of the Behavioral Science Directorate is collaboration with DoD CI customers, stakeholders, and a broad range of behavioral scientists to produce high caliber behavioral and social science consultation services, training, and research and analytic products, that uniquely improve the quality of counterintelligence (CI) operations, investigations, and analyses.

The research component of the Behavioral Sciences Directorate of CIFA supports research projects conducted in the private (industry and academic) sector in support of investigations, consultations, teaching and training relevant to the CIFA Mission. This research is primarily focused on:  (i) developing and evaluating reliable, valid, behavior-based methods of evidence and human intelligence sources ssessment; (ii) developing and evaluating methods for understanding terrorist groups and their relationships to populations of interest; and (iii) methods for the translation principles and models in the social and behavioral sciences developed in laboratory settings to field and operational settings.

III. BAA RESEARCH AREAS OF INTEREST

CIFAs areas of interest for this Broad Agency Announcement are outlined in Secitons A through E below.  Research involving human subjects conducted on behalf of a CIFA may be undertaken only with the informed consent of the subject, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, setting out conditions that safeguard the welfare of such subjects.   The methods, data and all analyses will be unclassified.

A.	Counter-Surveillance Detection Tool

At present there are no standardized instruments for behavioral assessments of sources within the field or operational setting. There is ongoing need to develop instruments and methods for source assessment and to determine whether an individual is engaged in or under surveillance. The purpose of this Area of Interest is to evaluate, via field testing, scientifically valid and culturally sensitive Commercial Off the Shelf Software and government-funded instruments that have been developed to aid case officers engaged in assessing sources and detecting surveillance. Evaluations will require interviews with training and operational personnel engaged in behavioral assessments within operational settings to characterize current practices and itemize what practitioners? needs are.  The goal would be to reach consensus among the operational/user community as to which methods or tools are most useful. 

B.	Cultural Training Tools

In inter-cultural interviews, even when the interviewer can speak the language of the interviewee, often there is a misinterpretation of the behavioral cues (gestures, facial expressions, whole body adjustments) used by both the interviewer and the interviewee.  This kind of miscommunication may hinder the exchange of useful information and alienate both parties. The purpose of this Area of Interest is to develop and test indirect assessment methodologies that measure the beliefs of (i) members of a non-Western culture about the behaviors associated with truth-telling and deception within their own culture, and (ii) national security investigators about the behaviors associated with truth-telling and deception within that same non-Western culture. 

C.	Effective Interviewing and Elicitation Techniques

Techniques for collecting information from unwilling sources are necessary for a variety of government positions, ranging from the questioning of an embassy ?walk in? to the solicitation of information from a prisoner or detainee.  Personnel tasked with obtaining information from human sources must be armed with the most effective and ethical  interviewing and interrogation skills and tactics in order to gain intelligence that is reliable and valid. Unfortunately, many of the techniques currently in use often are based only on the individual experiences of the interviewers, anecdotal information, and shared beliefs, rather than on empirical behavioral and social science. Until evidence-based approaches to interviewing and elicitation are established, little progress will be made in our ability to distinguish effective from ineffective techniques.  The purpose of this Area of Interest is for the further development and validation testing one or more methods of interviewing unwilling subjects that already has been shown effective in controlled (laboratory) settings, to be assessed in multicultural field settings 

D.	Effective Training in Interviewing and Elicitation Techniques

Training programs for collecting information from unwilling sources teach an essential skill set for a variety of government positions, including operators and investigators.  There is a need to implement a standardized method of teaching and training.   The purpose of this Area of Interest is for the development and evaluation of a training course that takes advantage of what has been shown to be valid in other domains (e.g., marketing, clinical medicine, clinical psychology), such as computer-based structured interviews or training tapes that use actor-based live interviews (these are given as examples, not as requirements).

E.	Multicultural & Urban Intelligence 

Some of the most culturally and linguistically diverse communities found anywhere exist within American urban centers.  Local law enforcement agencies in these cities have developed intelligence collection methodologies and capabilities that suit such diversity and reflect the particular economic, cultural, and political institutions of both the police and the citizens they serve.  These methods have changed in response to local events (e.g., changes in NYPD, LAPD, LASD as a function of terrorist attacks and threats), which means that law enforcement agencies have experience with adapting to new environments and shifting populations.  But law enforcement policies and practices are neither conceived nor implemented in a vacuum; these occur in response to changes in the larger population and in specific groups of interest.  The relationship therefore is dynamic: responses of the ?state? and responses of the ?people? each affect each other.  The purpose of the Area of Interest is to develop and test a method to assess a local population?s reactions to its local law enforcement policies and procedures, with initial testing of the method within an urban population within the U.S., in collaboration with the local law enforcement agency or department.  

F.	Real-time Integration & Analysis Tool

Non-invasive/non-lethal behavioral assays, sensing/tracking technologies, and computing storage and analyses capabilities are growing rapidly.  These have the potential to serve as powerful adjuncts to human observer-based credibility assessment techniques.  In fact, behavioral, physiological, sensing and tracking techniques may be most powerful when they are used in a complementary manner.  However, application of these technologies to counter-intelligence requires understanding how they map onto behaviors of interest.  Such application also requires methods of determining which out of the large volumes of data collected should be saved, how data of interest can be distinguished from background ?noise,? how signals from various multimodal channels should be synthesized, and how these should be usefully analyzed.  In addition, for the results of such analyses to be useful to an operator, they need to occur in real-time.

The purpose of this area of interest is for preliminary investigation of the use of sensing and tracking technologies to complement observer-based source and asset assessments, for the development of algorithms to integrate these data on a real-time basis, and for evaluation of these technologies using traditional, observer-based methodologies.  Steps towards this goal will include (a) investigation of the usefulness of sensing, tracking and locating technologies for source and asset credibility assessment;  (b) investigation of the usefulness of the collection and analysis of digital traces for tracking and for understanding relational and social networks; (c) algorithm development for online (real-time) analyses of methods and tools for source assessments; and (c) validation of the outcomes with traditional measures of behaviors of interest.  

IV. AWARD INFORMATION 

A.	Anticipated Award Types:  It is anticipated to be in the form of a Cost Reimbursement type contract.  However the Government reserves the right to award grants, Cooperative Agreements (CAs), Other Transactions (OTs) Agreements, or interagency agreements to appropriate parties should the situation warrant.
B.	If any awards are made on any area of interest, CIFA anticipates that individual awards will be in $100,000 to $300,000 range.
C.	Anticipated Periods of Performance for New Awards: All proposals may request funding for a timeframe not to exceed 12 months. 

V. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

This BAA is open to ALL responsible sources. Offerors may include single entities or teams from private-sector organizations, government laboratories, FFRDCs, including Department of Energy national laboratories and centers, and academic institutions.  Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs), are eligible to respond to this BAA, individually or as a team member of an eligible principal offeror, so long as they are permitted under a sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women-Owned Small Business concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses concerns are encouraged to submit proposals. They are also encouraged to join others as team members in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside, pursuant to FAR Part 19.502-2.

VI. APPLICATION PROCEDURES

Vendors are invited to submit proposals for any or all areas of interest.  Each area of interest, however, must be addressed in separate electronic proposal submissions.  All proposals are to be e-mailed to Loretta.Buckley@cifa.mil in electronic MS Word format.  If the electronic version includes a signature from the appropriate representative of the offeror, hard copies will not be needed if a contract is ultimately awarded.  Electronic proposals must include separate technical and cost/price files, with separate emails for each area of interest proposed.    

The technical proposal must include:

1.	An Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, and Resumes of proposed researchers.
2.	Contact information such as e-mail addresses and telephone numbers to allow technical and contracting questions to be addressed;
3.	Institutional endorsement, signature of the proposed principal investigator, time frames for all phases of the project, and detailed accounts of proposed work and budget. 

The Abstract, Background, and Technical Approach sections of the proposals should be no greater than 15 pages in length per area of interest.  All pages should be single-spaced, have one-inch margins, and utilize a typeface no smaller than Times New Roman 12 font.  Proposals should be sufficiently detailed to be responsive to the criteria, described below, for evaluation.  Additional materials may include vitae, references, and institutional information.  

An evaluation team appointed by the CIFA contracting officer to include scientific peers will review the proposals according to the following dimensions in order of importance:  

1.	Importance of the research to CIFA Behavioral Science Directorate?s Mission. 
2.	Technical merit, appropriateness, and feasibility of the proposed approach. 
3.	Scientific significance and originality. 
4.	The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator and key personnel, and institutional resources and facilities. 

   For each dimension, the proposal will be given a score grade between 1 and 5, where ?1? is highly meritorious (meets approximately 100% of the requirements), ?2? is meritorious (meets approximately 75% of the requirements), ?3? is good (meets approximately 50% of the requirements), ?4? is fair (meets approximately 25% of the requirements) and ?5? is lacking substantive merit (meets less than approximately 25% of the requirements).  Details on the scoring are as follows:

1.	Those proposals with very low importance to CIFA will be unable to recover even with high scores on the other dimensions.  
2.	A score of ?1? for dimensions 2 ? 4 would indicate that the proposal exceeds requirements and clearly demonstrates the offeror?s scientific capability to deliver exceptional performance.

All proposal submissions must contain the following sections: Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, and Resumes of proposed researchers.  A separate MS Word file will contain the proposed Cost or Price information.

Abstract. The abstract should be one page or less. It should describe the problem underlying the research, the methodology being developed, explain the objective of the proposal, and provide a condensed, but meaningful description of the technical approach. Authors should reference the most relevant sections of the BAA in the abstract.

Background. The background should include a description of the problem, as the proposal author understands it. It is helpful if the author shows an understanding of the CIFA contexts that apply to the proposed research. Clearly, there will not be enough space to write a critical, annotated bibliography, but the author should demonstrate meaningful knowledge of the background of the research that is being proposed.

Technical Approach. This should include a description of the behavioral or social science principles upon which the research is to be based, the goal of that research, and a detailed account of how the research is to be done. This account should be much like the methods section of a research paper. It should include a description of the data to be collected, the methods for collecting the data, the number and source of subjects and how they will be acquired, and the proposed research design and likely analysis methods. 

Reference List. This should be a list of all the references called out in the body of the proposal. It should not include publications that are not referred to in the body.  The references list must be in American Psychological Association format, APA 5th Edition.

R?sum?s. R?sum?s or vitae should be included for all proposed researchers with special emphasis on the Principal Investigator(s). It is particularly important that resumes include publications that bear on the research being proposed.   

Cost/Price Proposal.  This should be a typical budget section as is required by other federal agencies. However, it should also include a description of total dollars required overall for the government fiscal year (the government fiscal years run from October 1 through the following September 30), and the number of person hours/months broken out by personnel type (senior scientist, graduate student, research associate, clerk, etc.).  Proposers who are not in the Washington, DC area should budget at least one trip per year to CIFA in Arlington, VA to present the progress of their research.  The cost/price proposal must contain all elements of cost, including labor, indirect charges, profit or fee, and other direct costs to include any material costs and/or travel costs required.  Companies which have rates approved for use by DCAA or which have GSA schedule rates shall so identify.

VII. CONCEPT PAPERS  

While Concept Papers are optional, CIFA invites potential applicants who would like an early indication of the suitability of their topics to submit Concept Papers by e-mail (preferred) to Loretta.Buckley@cifa.mil or by post to the below address.  If submitted, Concept Papers must be in the form of an MS Word Document, be three double-spaced pages or less, concisely address the proposed research, and should contain only an approximate total budget projection. Please enclose an e-mail address and a telephone number where you can be reached. Please submit concept papers at least 2 weeks before the deadline for proposals. Concept papers submitted later than this date may not receive a timely response.

VIII. DEADLINES

To be considered for funding in FY07, electronic versions of the formal proposals (in for form of a single MS Word Doc file) must be received at CIFA by e-mail no later than 3:30 P.M. EST on 1 August 2007.  Electronic versions of the technical and cost proposals must be submitted as separate files in one email.  These files must be e-mailed to Loretta.Buckley@cifa.mil.  All vendors submitting proposals will be notified of the results of their proposal and if the government intends to award a contract to them.  

CIFA intends to make contract awards for areas of interest on this BAA, if at all, between 1 September 2007 and September 30, 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation. THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION IS ATTACHED; NO FURTHER SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction per the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The SWFSC in La Jolla, CA intends to acquire services to improve information beaked whale diving behavior, near-shore distribution, movements, and population structure around the Hawaiian Islands.  Population size and trends in population size are some of the most valuable data used for this purpose. Large-scale ship surveys were conducted in 2002 around the Hawaiian Islands; however, there is no data on beaked whale diving in this area on which to base abundance correction factors. There is also no information on the movement patterns of beaked whales in this area.  In addition to general population assessment, NMFS has a mandate to monitor and mitigate human-caused impacts on marine mammal population. Recently, the strandings of beaked whales has been associated with loud anthropogenic sounds, such as military sonar.  NMFS is working with the U.S. Navy to determine what factors are involved in causing these strandings. Lack of knowledge about the normal diving behavior of beaked whales is an impediment to understanding the cause of strandings.  The statement of work outlines the tasks, methodologies, specifications and standards, deliverables, and technical evaluation factors.  The period of performance is through 1 October 2008.  ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7115 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

Submission to this RFI should be directed to the undersigned, to the following email addresses:  alyssa.murray@us.army.mil and nellie.potockireeves@us.army.mil, no later than 1:00 p.m. on Monday, July 30, 2007.     Attachment 1  Market Research Request for Information (RFI) for The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Program Analysis and Evaluation Agent-Based Modeling of Irregular Warfare (ABMIW) RFI # 2007-1276 ABMIW. The purpose of the study is twofold: support a study of specific classified scenarios to be conducted by the contractor with input and assistance from PA&E staff analysts, and to support a PA&E staff led evaluation of the general utility and limitations of  agent-based models to analyze irregular warfare.  IV&V&A (Verification, Validation, and Accreditation) issues and limitations of this approach are to be identified.  PA&E and its government partners are evaluating multiple approaches in this area and this  effort requires an agent-based modeling approach.   The output of the study follows: 1) answers to the study questions for the classified study, 2) an evaluation of the agent-based approach, and 3) an operational model and database to be operated by PA&E from the PA&E Simulation and Analysis Center location  in Arlington, VA, subject to programming and/or helpdesk support from the model developer. The agent-based model will include a module for Information Operations.  The agents will have the ability to interpret messages (representing media, information campaigns, cultural ideas, political beliefs, and messages from the environment) in terms of th eir utility, well being or satisfaction, and react to those messages.  This utility, well being or satisfaction may incorporate direct physical benefit but also will incorporate sense-making, cognitive consonance, and benefits on the psychological and cult ural level.  The agent-based model will incorporate the influence, based on social theories agreed upon with the government, of infrastructure, economic, and practical constraints and opportunities on behavior.  It will model the relation between these phe nomena and thoughts, beliefs, and ideas that mediate between these physical states and action, for agents representing individual citizens, military, political, and government personnel.    The constraints and opportunities that these messages afford, based on social theories agreed upon with the government, will be taken into account in the model.  The model will also accommodate the strategic and game theoretical implications of the cultura lly based beliefs people have about the messages sent by DIMEFIL (Diplomatic, Intelligence, Military, Economic, Financial, Information and Law Enforcement) activities undertaken at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels in addition to the results from information campaigns.   The agent based model will include the formation and dissolution of social groups, (pre-organized and organized), including political, terrorist, and insurgent organizations (factionalism), resulting from the individual decisions of its members and leaders , as well as the actions of states (including the formation and dissolution of states, as well as state failure and success).    The agent base d model will include the interactions between decisions of individual members of a group and the top down decisions of the group leaders that affect the formation and dissolution of organized social groups.   The simulation will include the capability of working out political compromise such as the reallocation of goods or control among interested groups. The agent-based model will incorporate the effects of individual DIMEFIL actions at a lower level of resolution than the strategic/campaign level and work out their implications, so that patterns emerge in the PMESII (Political, Military, Economic, Social,  Infrastructure and Information) environment, on the level in which strategic and campaign decisions are made.  Lower level rules and strategic level patterns will both be in accordance with social theories agreed upon with the government. The agent based model will include and make use of a database of the infrastructure, political, economic, and social states and relations between agents, so as to work out the implications of actions in a particular instantiation of a PMESII environment, g iven the rules of relations from micro level and macro level political, social, cultural, psychological, and economic social theories agreed upon with the government.  It will use this data in concert with the application of social rules to give a plausibl e outcome of DIMEFIL actions in the PMESII environment. The simulation will be transparent:  analysts will be able to access a complete description of the state of the simulation at output and during processing.  The simulation will have a causal tracing tool to aid in finding the patterns of behaviors which ca use the emergent effects.   After a preferably automated calibration process, the data and social theory should support the social models at the individual relation level as well as the level of groups of relations and sequences of relations.   The input schema will be convenient for switching in and out modular sets that are applicable to particular social theory paradigms and particular world regions.  This may take the form of an interface (e.g. xml files for artificial intelligence (AI) modul es that determine actions from sensor input). One deliverable will be an integration toolkit in which AI modules may be plugged in, or data, or other simulations.  This toolkit will deal with differences in ontology (data and knowledge representation schemes) between these modules in a way that allows  new modules to interface in a flexible way.  It must also use a standard interface.   This toolkit should support a variety of integration schemes (e.g., voting, conflict resolution and iterative integration schemes).   There will be a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the causal tracing, xml input, calibration, and simulation/AI/data plug-ins that will facilitate ease in building and testing of simulations.  Nothing follows.

When the liquid in the sump reaches a predetermined level the float opens the valve which allows the motive fluid to enter either the float guide pipe (non loop model) or the bypass loop (loop Model).  The motive fluid travels to the eductor at the base of the unit.  Fluid passes through the eductor nozzle it reduces the sump liquid into the drainer.  The combination of motive fluid and suction liquid is then discharged.  This process continues until the liquid in the sump is lowered to a predetermined level.

<DESC>ARMAMENT/MUNITIONS DIGITAL MODELING & SIMULATION (AMDMS) SOFTWARE.   The 46th Test Wing, a leader in weapon system test and evaluation (T&E), has a new initiative to modernize and improve  our modeling, simulation and analysis (MS&A) capabilities for comprehensive T&E of developmental air armament systems.  The 46th Test Wing is soliciting Concept White Papers addressing unique and creative solutions for advancing digital MS&A in support of developmental, operational, and Live Fire T&E of air armament.  We are seeking ideas that (1) improve existing MS&A tools, techniques and methodologies for conventional weapons T&E; and (2) develop next generation digital MS&A tools, techniques and methodologies, to prepare for emerging tactical, area denial, and directed energy weapons T&E.  The intention is a systematic integration of models developed by laboratories, AAC, and contractors into common suites of reusable modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) tools.  The goal is to reduce expensive open air testing and increase the value of fewer smarter tests.  This project will also facilitate a seamless transition of M&S between the research & development, developmental T&E, simulation, and flight T&E communities.  The Armament/Munitions T&E community requires a full spectrum of credible digital models and simulations that are interoperable, correlatable, and portable; with a full range of resolution and response time to meet the needs of the T&E customer.  AMDMS requirements include: performance/effectiveness, aircraft integration and compatibility models; separation and fly-out models; survivability; and end game models for lethality/vulnerability and seeker/signature.  Some models must support the High-Level Architecture (HLA) and/or other protocols to support distributed connections with joint test and training facilities.  The Concept White Papers may include the modeling and simulation of phenomenon related to the development, testing or employment of Armament currently in the AF inventory or under consideration for development or acquisition, including but not limited to: precison guided munitions, directed energy weapons, hard target defeat, conventional blast/fragmentation, area denial, non-lethal defense, and hypersonic weapon systems.  Priority will be given to those concepts and ideas that provide a viable migration strategy from existing simulation tools towards robust extensible architectures with wide application or ideas that directly address shortfalls in simulation tools for  emerging technologies.  DO NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  Potential offerors are encouraged to contact the AMDMS Technical Director about their ideas before submitting white papers.  Offerors are required to submit via email (AMDMS@eglin.af.mil) a 3 - 5 page white paper with cover letter in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.  However, if email capability is not available, submit three copies of the white paper to the AMDMS Technical Director at the address shown below.  The white paper shall be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Submitter, Date, Email Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, Organization/Office symbol, Address, Period of Performance, Cost of Effort; Section B:  Proposed Solution; Section C:  Technical Summary.  Multiple white papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror.  However, each white paper must address only one concept.  White papers may be submitted at any time.  However, to be considered for FY04 funding they should be submitted by 1 August 2003.  For follow-on years, submit white papers by 1 July of each year to obtain the greatest chance for the funding in the next FY.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and cost proposal.  Authors of white papers whose concepts are not selected for further consideration will be notified with a written non-selection letter.  Offerors proposals will be evaluated based on its technical merit in addressing the areas described in this announcement, the past performance of the offeror in accomplishing similar work, and the reasonableness of the costs proposed. An invitation to submit a formal proposal based upon a submitted white paper does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Questions on the technical objectives or preparation of the white paper should be posted to AMDMS@eglin.af.mil or mailed to the AMDMS Technical Director.  Please direct contractual questions to Contract Specialist, Dona Dowdy-Merchant, at 850-882-0185 or email: dona.dowdy-merchant@eglin.af.mil.  Offerors may be required to establish third party agreements with other contractors.  Eligibility to access classified information may be required, depending on what ideas or concepts are proposed.   Proprietary data must bear an appropriate restrictive legend.  Any classified materials must be identified as such, and marked and packaged in accordance with the Industrial Security Manual. Offerors that cannot meet the requirements for access to US export controlled information need not apply, foreign offerors will be considered only in unusual circumstances. There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be alert for any published amendments made to this Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).  This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) is open and effective until canceled.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission.   This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any white paper/proposal preparation cost for responding.

<SUBJECT>B -- Special Studies and Analysis - Not R&D
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA) has a requirement for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a non-competitive award to Biocon Inc., 15801 Crabbs Branch Way, Rockville, MD 20855-2635, to continue to provide to the NIDCR, breeding and housing services for 3 (three) double knockout and 2 single knockout mouse lines.

The contractor will continue housing and breeding these mouse lines for the cryopreservation for the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center.  These lines are also required to provide tissue harvesting for analysis of proteins.

The contract period of performance is for approximately six (6) months beginning in July, 2007.  

The facility is located in Rockville, Maryland which allows investigators of the NIH Laboratories to have immediate access to the animals when necessary.    

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the contractor has been provided these knockout strains of mice breeding and housing services for ongoing NIH projects.  Immediate access to the contractor facility must be close enough for NIH investigators.  The contractor has the experience and has been responsible for the appropriate breeding and genotyping of mice on the ongoing projects for NIH.  An award to any other source for the continuation of this service would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  

This requirement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, size standard 500 employees.  

The Small Business Set-Aside applies to this requirement. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties shall review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which shall include: 1) a firm fixed price; 2) documentation of the capabilities of meeting the government?s requirements; 3) at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government?s specifications; and  4) a proposed service plan.   The proposal will be evaluated on the submission of the above documents.  The proposal is due on July 30, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  The proposal must also include the prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNs), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors Business size.  The offeror must be registered in the Government?s Contractor Registry System.  Note: www.ccr.gov.

REQUIREMENTS:  COTS Software provided by Marshall & Swift, 80 licenses for Residential Estimator and 80 licenses for Commercial & Agricultural estimators.

<SUBJECT>--INDUSTRY DAY  -  HOSTED BY PM-SKOT AT TACOM-RI
<DESC>TACOM is hosting a conference  PM-SKOT Industry Day, The conference will be held August 28-29, 2007 at Isle of Capri Ballroom in Bettendorf, Iowa.  PM-SKOT refers to Sets, Kits, Outfits and Tools managed by PM-SKOT, in Rock Island, Illinois; The purpose of this conference is to provide information regarding PM-SKOT    historically, where we are at now, and what is anticipated for the future.  Over time, weve seen a steady increase in requirements and are projecting even greater numbers for th e future.  In fact, in the past fiscal year, PM-SKOT has experienced a significant increase over historical numbers. Changes to Army regulations are under consideration that would make PM-SKOT the Single Source for Sets, Kits, Outfits and Tools, significan tly expanding our pool of items procured for the War Fighter.  This change was suggested after initial studies showed a pervasive tendency among units to acquire SKOT items by means of local purchases.  This has resulted in acquisition of inferior products , with inferior warranties and higher prices.  Making PM-SKOT the Single Source for tools could add an additional $8M in requirements per year to the SKO Contract.  This new mission, in addition to several opportunities with other PMs and other Services, have combined to make for a large potential increase in business opportunities with PM-SKOT.  PM-SKOT will need to handle this enhanced market share and looks to industry to assist us in creating a flexible, responsive model to handle the increased workloa d. PM-SKOT would like to solicit white papers from industry on the topics listed below.  The white papers are requested by 3 August, 2007, to david.kimzey@us.army.mil  PM SKOT intends to set aside time to meet individually with interested contractors at their request (see preliminary agenda below),  to discuss information contained in the White Papers.  The purpose of these individual meetings is to ensure PM SKOT under stands the contents of the information provided as well as to provide a confidential forum for contractor specific questions or comments about their companys participation in the SKO segments.  While the Government may use appropriate general information or ideas gathered from the White Papers during the general sessions, we will not share company confidential information marked proprietary during the conference.  To assist with this, please ensure you include the appropriate proprietary markings on any do cuments provided.  White Paper Topics: 1.	Problem Statement:  PM-SKOT was used to cyclical requirements generated by funding availability.  With the Single Source initiative, requirements could come in quantities that may vary from one to hundreds accompanied by short lead times for delivery. It is believed this situation mirrors that faced by industry in the commercial market place.  How can we predict or project out-year requirements in an uncertain market? Are there commercial models that can be used to predict cyclic or surge requirements?  What contracting arrangement would be attractive to industry for low density items requiring rapid deliveries?  Does industry have any recommendations on a contract vehicle suitable for this environment? 2.	Problem Statement:  As PM-SKOT moves to become the Single Source for Tools, requirements will come in from a variety of sources.  What is the most efficient means of capturing and fulfilling customer orders?  Is a web site best suited to meet these need s, and if so, are there commercial models for system and staffing requirements?   3.	Problem Statement: The current SKO contract was created to allow segments of bidders to be identified as interested and qualified to respond to requests for pricing and allow quicker lead times between identification of need and contract award while sti ll obtaining competition.  PM-SKOT is finding we are not receiving competitive bids for all of our requirements; sometimes only one segment member responds to a pricing re quest.  Reasons given are the number of line items, small quantities, and short turn around times.  What type of solicitation turn around time and contractual arrangement would work best to meet expected but unquantifiable quantities and mixes of SKOT item s?  Does your company have any other recommended changes to the current SKO contractual arrangement?   4.	Problem Statement:  The PM-SKOT environment is evolving in several ways:   a.	A Shift from primarily ID/IQ type contracts to Requirements Contracts when it makes sense. b.	The make or buy decisions involving government installation capacity. c.	The shift in funding sources, i.e.,  ratio of AWCF to PA dollars d.	A variety of sources generating requirements e.	The possibility of kitting Special Tools for the various Army Platform PMs and for other Services. What information could be or should be shared between industry partners and PM-SKOT to allow both sides to be responsive to the others needs?   PM-SKOT would like to hear back from interested industry partners on the 4 specific topics listed above and on other topics of interest that could form the basis for conference sessions. It is tentatively planned to be a two day conference with shared sess ions as well as individual meetings (if desired) scheduled between government representatives and individual contractors.  Please provide a list of participants you wish to send to this conference.  In the event there are more participants than space avail able, it might be necessary to limit the number of participants.  Should this situation present itself, PM SKOT will contact your companys designated POC and request an updated list of attendees.   Lastly, if there are interested companies unfamiliar with the SKO contract arrangement and you desire more information and background, please contact CPT David Kimzey at the e-mail address provided above.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred to in OTI as the "bullpen," serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI worldwide.  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in the field and in Washington, often with little time for preparations.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The worldwide nature of OTI's program requires a Training Advisor who can provide immediate consultation on OTI projects when requested. The proper execution of OTI programs demands that an individual with training and facilitation skills be available to be sent out on a case by case basis to facilitate specific training related services such as OTI orientation, start-up workshops, strategy sessions and project reviews.  To maximize program effectiveness, the incumbent will develop training sessions to support staff training and development.  The incumbent must be available and prepared to provide these services both in OTI operation units overseas as well as in Washington, DC.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call training specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

This position requires excellent training design and delivery skills, a high degree of communication skills and facilitation ability to serve as a liaison between the Office of Transition Initiatives, USAID Washington, and contract staff for training related matters. The incumbent will work with a wide range of OTI programs designing and facilitating country start-up workshops, strategy and team building sessions, reviews, and OTI training courses, both in Washington and in the field. The Training Advisor will report to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division or his/her designee, and also liaise and collaborate with the OTI Program Office, country program teams in the OTI Field Programs Division, and implementing partner staff as appropriate for planning and implementing various training or facilitation exercises.  The Training Advisor will consult with his/her supervisor or designee on a regular basis to integrate OTI culture, operating procedures, and programming into training design and delivery and respond to office priorities for training related activities.

* Design and facilitate staff orientations and trainings, ensuring various USG interests and policy are represented within the training content;

Training sessions will contribute to the development of strategic training direction and plans in support of OTI's overall goals;

* Incorporate lessons learned from OTI field programs and OTI/W operations into training curricula and provide OTI/Washington with regular reports;

* Communicate with OTI/W and OTI Field staff to integrate concerns, lessons learned, policy, and relevant information into trainings;

* Contribute to the development of a library of training materials, job aids, and on-line materials to enhance OTI employees' performance;

* Contribute to the development and maintenance of a monitoring and evaluation system for OTI training to include assessing the effectiveness of training sessions and applying lessons learned to the OTI Training Program;

* Provide guidance and orientation to incoming OTI Trainer(s); and 

* Provide training or facilitation related support for other USAID offices as required.

_____DESCRIPTION:

I.	GENERAL

BACKGROUND

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  

(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 

(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  

The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  


SCOPE

The National Labor Relation?s Board (NLRB) desires to procure the services of a Contract Specialist.  The Contract Specialist will prepare a variety of contract actions in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Work assignments shall be made with the expectation that the Contract Specialist will be able to complete assignments independently.  Work products shall be prepared for review/approval by a designated NLRB Contracting Officer.

Contractor personnel shall not perform inherently Governmental activities.  The Government contemplates a single award for one (1) full-time position, with an option to increase the level of effort with additional staff.  The engagement is expected to last through September 30, 2007. At the NLRB's option, the period of performance may be extended for up to one year.

STATEMENT OF WORK
U.S DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION
2008 NOAA HERITAGE WEEK
EXHIBITION AND RELATED OUTREACH ACTIVITIES
July 2007


BACKGROUND 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is one of several Federal agencies charged with the responsibility to inventory, preserve, and showcase federally-managed historic and cultural ?heritage? resources, and to foster heritage tourism in partnership with local communities and the private sector. NOAA has been working to preserve its heritage resources---from historic maps and charts to buildings and shipwrecks?and make them available through innovative programs and partnerships. Heritage Week, including the Treasures of NOAA?s Ark exhibition, is now in its fourth year.  
Treasures of NOAA?s Ark is a week-long exhibition of 
NOAA?s heritage assets, including scientific instruments, 
equipment, historical documents, and many other items 
of interest presented in a museum-style format within a 
3000 square-foot indoor space located at NOAA?s Silver 
Spring, Maryland headquarters. NOAA is again engaging in the continued effort to design and produce an exhibition, special activities, and outreach activities anchored by NOAA Heritage Week. That week is February 4-10, 2008.

The theme for Treasures of NOAA?s Ark 2008 is shipwrecks.  In addition to NOAA having a long heritage of providing navigational charts, NOAA has been at the forefront of providing technology for safety at sea, mapping the seafloor with side scan sonar, and managing a variety of marine heritage assets including the USS Monitor. The overall thrust of the exhibit is to display the significant role that NOAA has played in the nation?s history.

ACTIVITIES

1. CONSTRUCTION

The contractor shall be required to construct an exhibit room and props which provide a navigational theme and atmosphere. The location of the exhibit will be the NOAA Science Center in Silver Spring, MD. This requirements include the following:

o Construction of a room consisting of three sides, each measuring approximately 15-feet long and 8-feet high.  One of the sides shall contain two open doorways consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. The front, or full open side, shall lodge against the glass and metal frame structure that forms the entrance to the exhibit space.  The constructed room shall now form the new ?entrance? to the exhibit.  The room shall be themed as a late 18th century-early 19th century pub, the sort of place people would have gone to find work as crewmembers on sailing ships.  The contractor shall paint and trim the room in this theme. Visitors will have to pass through this room first as they enter the exhibition

o Construction of a three-sided old ?shack? to resemble a early to mid-twentieth century sail shop or boathouse.  Possible dimensions?12-feet wide by 10-feet deep.  The open side shall allow visitors to view what a sail or boat shop would have looked like.  Its interior shall not be directly accessible by visitors.  

o Construction of or provision of what would appear to be the remnants of a sunken ship.  It may be from any historical period, or any type of vessel, such as a steel or wooden hull vessel in appearance. This set piece shall be one of the significant exhibits and this should be reflected in its size - up to 18-feel long. 

o Provision of a rocky coastline set piece, possibly made of styrofoam.  It should be somewhat realistic.  NOAA will work closely with the contractor in the design and build of this set piece.  This rocky coast should measure approximately 100 to 150 square feet and be about 8 to 10 feet high. 

o Treasures of NOAA?s Ark owns and has located on site pre-built movable wall units that will be used as part of the exhibit set.  These walls are 4-feet wide by 8-feet high by 5-inches thick, and weigh approximately 90 pounds each.  The wall units each have metal plates that can be attached as ?feet? and provide stability.  The units also can be attached to on another.  The exhibition will make use of about twenty (20) of these wall units.  The contractor shall provide sufficient personnel to move, position, secure, and paint these wall units.

o Provision and installation of approximately 250 running feet of 18-foot high black pipe and drape. Provision of an additional 200 running feet of 9-foot high black pipe and drape. The contractor shall take measurements to determine the exact lengths required. 

o The contractor shall provide and hang a (size is approximate/negotiable) 12-foot by 30-foot mural of a U.S. coastline and an 18-foot by 18-foot lighted star field curtain.

2. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITES

o The contractor shall provide and install a sound system that includes six separate channels with six separate CD players. Each channel shall have independent volume controls. CD players shall be single disc (not multiple disc) players. Each CD player shall have a ?repeat? function. The system shall include six speakers and stands (however, all six stands may not be used depending on final design and layout of exhibit). The system shall include a high quality, wireless microphone suited for speech. The system shall have a central control/mixer board.  Other AV requirement: Three (3) each self contained DVD players with flat screens to play DVDs in different parts of the exhibit.

o The ceiling in the room to be used for this exhibition 
is approximately 20 feet high.  The room is illuminated 
by track lighting attached to the ceiling.  There are 
approximately 130 individual track lights.  There is no 
grid from which to hang anything.  Each fixture is six inches in diameter and shall be gelled individually in order to enhance the overall lighting mood of the room.  The contractor shall recommend lighting shades for this room and the shipwreck scenes.

o The contractor shall provide three lighting trees, each with three to six lights. Several of these lights shall need shimmer/water effect gobos.

o The contractor shall budget for eight hours (8) of studio time with a local (Washington/Baltimore) recording studio and engineer to edit and mix music and sound effects that will be provided by NOAA. NOAA will also provide a producer.

o The contractor shall provide a variety of props and other trimmings to connote a shipwreck scene and a general nautical feel and look.  These items shall include, but are not limited to:  variety sizes of wooden barrels, crates, chests, netting, line, authentic looking plastic sea birds such as seagulls, wooden planks, burlap, old sail material.

o The contractor shall provide graphics production, including up to thirty (30) 24-inch by 36-inch four-color posters, up to five (5) banners (standard sizes such as 4-feet by 8-feet ). The contractor shall hang these graphics in the exhibit area. NOAA will provide all art work and text for these graphics. Banners shall be of a durable material that will hang nicely in a gallery/exhibition setting (e.g. canvas or Coraplast).

o The contractor shall provide a fun, yet usable, educational product to be available for visitors during Heritage Week to help them better understand and appreciate the experience they just had.  The educational item can be practical or whimsical, large or small but it must indicate NOAA?s web site address.  Anticipated quantity is in the 3000 to 10,000 range.  NOAA will work with the contractor to select the item(s) and quantity(ies).  Estimated cost of each item shall be approximately one dollar ($1.00) per educational item.

o The contractor shall set up approximately  four activity stations or tables where visitors can experience hands on demonstrations (i.e., ?map a shipwreck site?, ?knot tying?).  To maintain the shipwreck theme, the contractor shall construct these tables in the following manner to simulate rough-hewn table boards:  5-inch, 8-inch, or 12-inch pine boards 1-inch think joined together to make a table top approximately 35-inches by 35-inches.  Two-by- fours used as facing boards shall give the appearance that the table top is very thick.  The boards shall then be distressed and stained a dark color.  Each table top may then be secured to its own wine barrel base.  

o The contractor shall be required to dismantle and
remove the exhibit, including all set pieces, floor, 
wall, and ceiling treatment, and any other elements of 
the exhibit. The contractor shall have one (1) ten-hour day to remove all portions of the exhibition they provided.  
Arrangements can be made for portions of a second day if 
necessary. NOAA staff will remove all artifacts and heritage items and will be fully responsible for their safe care.


SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES

Opening day for Heritage Week 2008 Treasures of NOAA?s
Ark Silver Spring is Monday, February 4, 2008.  All 
poster elements must be completed and on site by January 2, 2008.  All exhibit elements must be installed between Wednesday, January 30 and Friday, February 1, 2008.


 
PRINTING 

All printing will be done by the COTR.  Contractor will not be reimbursed for printing expenses.  Contractor may provide COTR with master copy of any materials that require printing. 

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Contractor will be held to the following performance measures:

o Timing.  As stated, timing is essential to the success of this exhibition. The contractor must meet all deadlines. The contractor shall have up to two (2) days to install their portion of the exhibition as specified in this Statement of Work.  

o Quality.  The exhibits constructed or provided by the 
contractor shall be built or have been built to reflect a level of authenticity.  For instance, if faux finishes are used to indicate the boards of an old sailing ship, then that finish should provide a high degree of believability for the visitor that the boards are real.  Set pieces, props, and other items provided to hold artifacts (none weighing more that 30 pounds) shall be sturdy to safely hold the artifacts. 

o Authenticity. The Treasures shipwreck theme dictates 
that the set pieces and presentation materials maintain 
an authentic look and feel (see quality above). 

o Creativity. It is acknowledged that creativity is 
somewhat subjective.  NOAA will provide contractor with strong direction as to broad design ideas and concepts.  Contractor is expected to help refine these ideas to help NOAA produce a better exhibition.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Training Advisor (Intermittent PSC, OTI Bullpen) - Worldwide

Ladies/Gentlemen:

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications (Optional Form 612 only) from qualified U.S. citizens to provide personal services as a Training Advisor (Intermittent PSC, OTI Bullpen) under a personal services contract, as described in the attached solicitation.

The purpose of this Addendum is to provide the Attachments referenced in the main Solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted from a potential offeror.

Q - 1. In Section 9 a I/FS50 modulator with Antireflective Coating (ARC) at 632nm is requested. Please clarify what wavelength(s) of ARC the I/FS50 is to have applied: 800nm (for the Ti-Sapph laser), 532nm (for the CW pump laser and the solid state pump laser), the requested 632nm, or other (BBARC). If you still desire the 632nm ARC then there will be a loss of transmitted light at any wavelength other than 632nm.
A-1. The ARC wavelength for this component is as stated, 632 nm.

Q - 2. PEMs have a time period of 20 microseconds and each polarization state lasts approximately 1 usec. If you are using the CCD camera as a detector they are not fast enough to work with the PEM. Have you either spec?d a CCD which will work with the PEM or have you found a way to work around this?

A- 2. Yes, we have alternate detectors that will be used when the PEM is in operation

<DESC>1.  Background:

The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to taking care of its own.  Our Air Force (AF) members and their families deserve the best support possible.  AF readiness targets combat stress reactions, the deployment environment and deployment-related stressors. Tailored support of the base helping agencies targets deployment challenges and engages the services of base helping agencies.  The AF community is represented by several agencies, one of which is the Office of the Surgeon General (SG), Community Behavioral Health Division (CBHD).  

The USAF SG CBHD provides military readiness support through management of various programs engaged in individual, family and community health initiatives.  These programs include Family Advocacy; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment/Demand Reduction; Education and Development Intervention Services/ Special Needs; and Suicide Prevention.  Their objective is to address intervention and prevention strategies for common modifiable behavioral risk factors.  

The challenge is recognizing the stressful situations of military members; specific behaviors and concerns related to deployment stress.  Congress has provided funding through the Department of Defense to the USAF to make available, tailored support, for pre-deployment; deployment; 
post-deployment; integration and combat stress reactions.  There is an urgent need to provide various forms of early psychological intervention as part of the first response to the traumatic events of pre and post deployment.  Contractor will provide various workshops and consultation and clinical supervision on evidenced-based treatment of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

2.  Description of Services:  This contract will involve the development and delivery of one Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) two-day clinical training workshop and two within the Continental United States (CONUS) two-day clinical training workshop for military mental health providers (MHPs), which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.  The goal of these workshops is to train military MHPs to provide Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) treatment for active duty military members with combat-related ASD and PTSD.

2.1 Workshop Materials will be developed that are specifically tailored for the CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD in United States (U. S.) military personnel in both deployed and garrison settings.  This will include the creation of workshop handouts, reprints of scientific publications, clinical assessment materials, psychological measures and a provider?s treatment manual.  The contractor will provide relevant clinical training workshop and consultation materials during training to each attendee in hard copy and/or electronic media form.  

2.2 CONUS CPT Clinical Training Workshops:  Conduct one two-day CONUS CPT clinical training workshops and one two-day CONUS master clinical training workshop at the following locations and dates:  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous  expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.

   Langley Air Force Base (AFB), Virginia; 22-23 January 2008
   Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC), Lackland AFB, Texas; 19-20 February 2008

The workshops will include a review of evidence-based interventions for ASD and PTSD with a specific emphasis on CPT.  Approximately twenty-five to seventy-five military mental health providers will attend each workshop and attendees will receive training in the assessment and CPT treatment of ASD and PTSD in CONUS and deployed locations.  Clinical case examples, including audiotapes of treatment sessions of active-duty military patients with PTSD and ASD who were treated in Iraq, will be reviewed.  Attendees will be provided copies of assessment tools and a treatment manual for CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD.  The Government reserves the right to readjust the workshop dates in accordance with military and ops tempo demands.

2.3 OCONUS CPT Clinical Training Workshop:  Conduct one two-day OCONUS clinical training workshop at Aviano, Italy, 21 through 22 August 2007 for military MHPs, which includes psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers.  The goal of the workshop is to train military MHPs to provide CPT treatment for active duty military members with combat-related ASD and PTSD.  The Contractor will provide the necessary materials as outlined in paragraph 2.1 for each appropriate workshop.  The Contractor will be compensated for one rest day prior to the start of the OCONUS workshops to allow for jet lag.  All costs associated with travel, food, lodging and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop.
 
3.  CPT Clinical Consultation:

3.1 This contract will involve providing clinical consultation of approximately two hundred military MHPs, which include psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, upon completion of a two-day CPT training workshop on evidenced-based treatment of PTSD.  Clinical consultation will be conducted by telephone for those providers located in the OCONUS and CONUS areas.  Telephone consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned medical treatment facility (MTF).  It is anticipated that some of these cases will be located within CONUS; while others will located OCONUS, including individuals deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  For all consultation activities, guidelines will be followed to ensure privacy and confidentiality of all patient information.  For consultation with deployed providers, proper guidance and procedures will be followed in accordance with Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities (CIMGR), Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-101 and Communications Security (COMSEC), AFI 33-201, Volume (V) 1.

In-person supervision of cases and joint assessment and treatment will be available for patients treated at the WHMC, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, as requested by the military MHP.  The consultation format will allow for both individual, as well as, small group consultation.  

3.2 This contract will also involve providing consultation to approximately twenty-five to seventy-five military MHPs; which include psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, upon completion of the two-day master clinical CPT training workshop on evidence-based treatment of PTSD.  These individuals will be training to serve as future PTSD case supervisors and will require more extensive consultation than those attending the three-day workshop.  Clinical consultation will be conducted by telephone for those providers located in the OCONUS and CONUS areas.  Telephone consultation will be provided for the military MHPs as they begin to see clinical cases (patients) at their assigned medical treatment facility (MTF).
