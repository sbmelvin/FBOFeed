<SOLNBR>201814Q012A
<ARCHDATE>01212006
<CONTACT>Mary Drobot Purchasing Agent 5052486844     mary_drobot@fws.gov;
<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS AND REQUEST FOR QUOTE The Fish and Wildlife Service anticipates entering into a contract with a suitable Contractor, hereinafter referred to as "Contractor" and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, hereinafter referred to as "Service." Contractor shall perform a two-year, two-part project to identify Gila River basin streams that are fishless or occupied only by native fishes.  HISTORY: Fish & Wildlife Service and other personnel from academia, state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and other entities have repeatedly sampled and recorded the fauna of many Gila River basin streams in Arizona and New Mexico.  Native species now are extirpated from some places and most reaches have mixed faunas of native and non-native fishes.  A few streams have intact native communities absent an introduced component, and some apparently were fishless, at least at time(s) of visitation.  There also are some waters that have not recently, or in some cases ever, been sampled comprehensively.  Among the last three kinds of streams, fishless, native only, and unsampled, there may be some where suitable habitat is available for possible establishment or re-establishment of one or more native fish species, including threatened loach minnow and spikedace.  Such sites may be especially amenable to native fish management because they may not require a barrier to protect the fauna or renovation to remove an unwanted non-native species or community.   PURPOSE: A contractor shall perform a two-year, two-part study to identify Gila River basin streams that are fishless, native only, or unsampled.  This work is a fundamental prerequisite to transferring native species into such streams to establish new populations, replicate existing ones, or repatriate populations that have been extirpated.    OBJECTIVE: Objective of the contract is to identify fishless and native only streams in the Gila River basin.  This objective is to be met by successful completion of the following general tasks: (1) review available data bases and published and agency collection records, and interview knowledgeable professionals and lay persons to identify potential streams (fishless, native only, or unsampled), (2) design a field protocol to perform fish collections that verify fish occurrence or absence in streams identified in Task 1, and (3) implement the protocol developed under Task 2. The Service in cooperation with contractor and the Central Arizona Project Fund Transfer (CAP) Technical Committee will determine final site selections for sampling.  Specific objectives to be accomplished under each general task are provided in responsibilities below.  SCOPE OF WORK:	 Contractor shall perform a comprehensive review of published and unpublished databases, published literature, and gray literature to include agency and contract reports, files, web sites, and other materials.  From this information contractor will specifically identify streams or stream reaches that are thought to be fishless, occupied only by native fishes, or that have never or not recently been sampled.  Contractor will augment this information through interviews with knowledgeable professionals and other individuals.  Contractor will identify potential streams or stream reaches that meet the above criteria on 7.5-minute topographic maps. Task 1.)  Contractor will develop a generalized field protocol to verify the status of potential streams and stream reaches identified in Task 1 as fishless, native only, or unsampled.  The protocol will incorporate schedule and timing, methods, data recording and management, personnel requirements, and equipment needs.  It is anticipated that each stream site will be sampled more than once and that collections will be made when conditions are suitable (i.e., periods of high discharge, runoff, inclement weather, etc. are to be avoided).  Contractor will submit the draft field protocol to the Service, and incorporate Service comments and suggestions into a final protocol that will guide conduct under Task 3.  Protocol should be generally applicable across all streams of the Gila River basin upstream and including the Hassayampa River subbasin.  The Service in cooperation with Contractor and CAP Technical Committee will make the final site selections.  It is anticipated that changes in the protocol may be necessary during the course of field studies, and such changes should be communicated to the Service at Contractor's earliest convenience.   The Service does not anticipate a need for field surveys in the Verde and Blue river drainages, as relatively recent comprehensive surveys there have been accomplished.  However, relevant data reviews of those drainages are to be included in the final report. Task 2.)  Contractor will perform field studies according to the protocol and site selections developed under Task 2.  Sampling is to be opportunistic and intensive with the primary purpose of detecting and identifying fishes present.  Contract will maintain contact with and apprise Service of progress, problems encountered, and solutions to problems.  Contractor must have appropriate permits and permissions in hand when conducting field operations.  For example, a scientific collection permit issued by Arizona Game and Fish Department is required to authorize fish collections in the state, and other authorizations may be required by other permitting entities.  It is Contractor's responsibility to be aware of and comply with all such requirements.  Further, it is Contractor's responsibility to obtain permission, preferably in writing, to access and sample on private lands, Native American reservations, or anywhere else that such permission is required.  Task 3.)  Contractor will prepare a draft Final Performance Report for the Service that incorporates all methods, results, analyses, conclusions, recommendations and other materials derived from completion of Tasks 1-3.  The report will include a tabulation of all streams and stream reaches reviewed (Task 1) and indicate the fish community status for each (i.e., non-native only, mixed native-non-native, native only, fishless) on the basis of that review, and also indicate the actual status of each stream-stream reach based on the field surveys performed as part of Task 3.  All streams and stream reaches will be identified on 7.5 minutes topographic maps and related by stream or stream reach name to the tabulation.  The field protocol (Task 2) and any modifications thereto, or adjustments made during the course of the study, will be incorporated into the report. SERVICE WILL: a. Provide technical coordination and consultation within the Service, Contractor, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and other cooperating entities to exchange information and optimize the probability of successful completion of the project.  b. Be available as necessary to meet with Contractor to discuss progress and results.     c. Provide timely review of and comments on the Field Protocol developed under Task 2. d. Provide site selections for field surveys.  e. Provide timely review of the draft final performance report. Pricing shall include delivery and all applicable local, state, and federal taxes. PERFORMANCE SCHEDULE: Complete Task 1- 120 days				       Fish & Wildlife Service Reviews - 30 days                                Complete Task 2 and submit field protocol  - 180 days        Fish & Wildlife Service reviews and comment on protocol - 30 days                                      Incorporate comments - 30 days                                             Fish & Wildlife Service selects survey sites - 30 days                                                      Complete Task 3 field surveys - 365 days                            Meet as needed - once monthly                                           Submit draft Final Report - at end of performance period                                              Fish & Wildlife Service reviews and provides comments on Draft Final Report - at the end of performance period        Contractor incorporates comments and submit Final Report - 30 days                        REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 1.  Stream Status.  Contractor shall provide a list of references, databases, professional contacts, etc. developed in Task 1 to identify fishless, native only, and unsampled streams and stream reaches.  Contractor shall provide a tabulation of all streams and stream reaches reviewed (Task 1) and indicate the fish community status for each (i.e., non-native only, mixed native-non-native, native only, fishless) on the basis of that review.   2.  Topographic Maps.  Contractor shall provide copies of 7.5-minute topographic maps that identify by name and location the streams or stream reaches tabulated as part of Task 1. 3.  Field Protocol.  Contractor shall submit the draft field protocol developed under Task 2 to the Service, and incorporate Service comments to produce the protocol used to guide field collections made as part of Task 3. 4.  Draft Performance Report.  Contractor shall prepare and submit five (5) copies of a draft Final Performance Report for the Service that incorporates all methods, results, analyses, conclusions, recommendations and other materials derived from completion of Tasks 1-3.  Contractor shall present field results from Task 3 that verify or correct the status assessments (i.e., fishless or native only) based upon the Task 1 review.  Contractor also shall identify other streams or stream reaches that were occupied by non-native only or mixed native-non-native fish communities.    5.  Final Performance Report.  Contractor shall submit ten (10) copies of a Final Performance Report that addresses comments that result from the Service review of the Draft Final Performance Report.  FISHLESS AND NATIVE FISH ONLY STREAM IDENTIFICATION EVALUATION CRITERIA: Successful Contractor Should Demonstrate: 1.  Competence with identification and biology of all extant and some extirpated species of native and introduced fishes of the Gila River basin. 2.  Experience with database management and Geographic Information Systems. 3.  Ability to assemble an experienced fishery crew for stream surveys. 4.  Written and verbal communication skills, including the production of technical reports. 5.  Past performances meeting project time schedules and budgets. 6.  Cost-effectiveness, professionalism, and biological expertise in the preparation of the proposal. 7.  No conflict of interest. 8.  The ability to complete the task with a maximum of 20% overhead or indirect cost charges in compliance with policies of the Interagency Central Arizona Project Implementation program. (The purpose of the Central Arizona Project Transfer Program  is to implement conservation actions that are identified in existing and future recovery plans for Gila River basin Federal/State-listed or candidate native fish species.  The Program provides a maximum of $500,000 annually for a total of 25 years toward this goal.  Because funding is limited and the conservation project needs for the fishes are greater than those funds can accommodate, the Program has established a maximum allowable overhead rate for all potential recipients of Program funding.  This rate shall be no greater than 20 percent of the total project costs, exclusive of personnel benefits routinely included in calculation of hourly salary rates.)

<DESC>The DOE Savannah River Operations Office awarded Purchase Order to JXLC Consulting (poc: James Lieberman) to assist the DOE Savannah River Operations Office with technical and programmatic support relative to its plans to make non-high-level waste determinations for radioactive wastes resulting from spent fuel reprocessing, that DOE-SR plans to manage and dispose onsite as low-level waste at SRS.  These services are required by DOE-SR and DOE-EM as waste determinations are made to implement the SRS EM accelerated cleanup. The Secretary of Energy is required to consult on waste determinations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  The first DOE deliverable is due to the NRC by the end of January 2005, and the advice/technical services defined in this procurement is required prior to that time.  The waste determination preparation and approval work is critical path to completion of the EM accelerated cleanup at the Savannah River Site and each day of delay will result in additional lifecycle cost to the Government of $1 million.

Therefore, it is essential to complete the work for waste determinations immediately/urgently and thus precludes full and open competition.  Delay in award of this procurement would result in serious financial injury to ther Government.

<DESC>Description: The scope of this project (WWCX 05-1035) requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to correct deficient subgrade drainage and reconstruct subgrade depressions in airfield aprons and taxiways at Thule Air Base, Greenland.  The work includes but is not limited to leveling the base coarse and replaining deteriorated pavement, including lighting, painting and markings.  The work is broken down into separate and distinct phases.  Phase I of the Taxiways and Aprons has been completed under separate contract.  The remaining work will consist of Taxiways, Phase II (approx. 29,431 SY), Aprons, Phase II (approx. 59,270 SY), Taxiways, Phase III (approx. 47,600 SY), Aprons, Phase III (approx. 18,650 SY) and Aprons, Phase IV (approx. 10,235 SY), to include taxiway lighting (listed as a separate phase).  The contractor shall be responsible for determining the amount of work needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract specifications and drawings.  All quantities listed in the contract documents are estimates only.  The awardee will be responsible for determining actual needs.  Rock materials shall be mined and milled on-site at Thule Greenland utilizing the awardee’s equipment.  The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.  Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.  Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access.  Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The project is broken down into 6 separate and distinct phases of work.  The project magnitude (totaling 6 phases) is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  Because of the size of this project and funds availability, the Government proposes to award a Firm, Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5-year ordering period and list each phase as a separate contract line item number (CLIN).  Each CLIN would then have subCLINs for each Fiscal Year (FY) from FY05 through FY09 listing the price of work should it start in that respective FY (i.e, 0001AA would represent a price for award of a CLIN with performance starting in FY05, 0001AB would represent a price for award of the same CLIN with performance starting in FY06, etc).  The performance period for each phase shall be 520 calendar days from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP), which includes a winter exclusionary period of 245 calendar days.  The NTP will be issued simultaneously with the delivery order(s).  Even though the phase takes 520 calendar days (or longer if appropriately modified), the price to be paid would be that corresponding to the subCLIN representing the FY of award.  More than one Phase may be ordered at a time (i.e., Phase II of Aprons and Phase II of Taxiways, etc).  There will be no price adjustments allowed for inflation or changes in the economy.  The IDIQ will have a minimum obligation of one CLIN for performance starting this summer (FY05).  Additional phases (CLINs) will be ordered via delivery order as needed, funded, and allowed by schedule.  For example, if Phase II Aprons is completed in FY 06 and FY07 funding becomes available, the Government would award a delivery order for Phase III Aprons utilizing the subCLIN price corresponding to the price for performance starting in FY07.  A NTP will be issued with the delivery order starting the 520-day performance period, requiring completion of the work of Phase III Aprons in FY08, 520 days later.  More than one phase may be ordered during the same FY, depending on schedule and funding  (i.e., Phase II of Aprons and Phase II of Taxiways; Phase III of Taxiways and Phase IV of Aprons, etc), but each will be ordered under a separate delivery order.   Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.  Evaluation Price will be determined by adding all subCLINs for all CLINs.  Price will be evaluated equally with Past Performance.  A more favorable past performance rating may result in award to other than the lowest priced offeror, based on the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation.  It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 4 Feb 2005 with offers due 30 days thereafter.  Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.  This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4)—International Agreement, to only US and Danish firms.  Although no hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed, those firms interested in receiving a CD ROM version may request such by writing to: Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, PSC 73, APO AE 09716 or Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, U.S. Embassy, Dag Hammarskjolds Alle 24, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.

All offerors must complete the Business Management Questionnaire in Section L with at least three references that are similar in size and scope of this requirement.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database.  If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov.,  Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  
Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 
Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather 
information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into 
the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.   Offerors may submit signed and dated offers by facsimile to 202-353-7794 to the attention of Tatea Cavanaugh, Contracting Officer, by any available express mail service or hand delivery to 400 First Street NW, Washington, DC 20534.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and using procedures of FAR Part 13, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, working with Environment Canada and numerous local, state, and regional bodies is currently planning to begin an analysis of whether it should designate one or more SOx Emission Control Areas (SECAs) adjacent to North America (e.g., the West Coast, Gulf Coast, and East Coast) under MARPOL Annex VI (the international treaty addressing air emissions from ships). The contractor shall undertake a thorough examination and assessment of the global marine fuels market that focuses on five fundamental questions: 1) What are the general trends in the global marine fuels market, 2) How will the designation of SECAs in the Baltic and North Sea between 2006 and 2007 affect the global market, 3) How can we expect the major suppliers of marine fuel (e.g. Singapore, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Mexico) to modify refining capacity in light of these demands, 4) How would the designation of one or more SECAs adjacent to North America (West Coast, Gulf Coast, East Coast) further affect the market, and 5) What increases in shipping costs and the specific affects to the U.S. and North American economy can be anticipated as a result of these actions.  Qualified contractors shall have experience in analyzing the marine fuels market, knowledge of the shipping industry, and expertise in modeling and analyzing the petroleum refining industry. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and will be competed using Full and Open Competition.  The EPA anticipates the award of an Indefinite-delivery/Indefinite-quantity type contract.  The solicitation is expected to be issued February 3, 2005 and close 21 days thereafter.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 621511   The National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, Ohio, intends to negotiate with a small business, on a competitive basis, for a project entitled "DNA Sequencing for Augmentation." The objective of this project is for a contractor to conduct  sequencing of environmental clone libraries developed by EPA personnel and provide sequencing data in electronic form. The contractor shall perform sequencing reactions on template provided by EPA personnel and provide sequence electropherograms to the project officer. The specific tasks are as  follows:  Task 1: Sequencing of environmental clones The primary task of this project is to generate sequence information from clone libraries. MCCB personnel will provide the DNA template that will be sequenced by the contractor in the form of bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli cells  transformed with TA plasmid containing the PCR clones.  The contractor shall perform the following steps: pick bacterial colonies and transfer colonies to growth medium, grow bacteria overnight at appropriate temperature, perform plasmid purifications and sequencing reactions, clean sequencing  reactions, and perform sequencing electrophoresis. Sequencing reactions will the performed with either M13F or M13R primers.  The primers will be provided by the sequencing company. It is estimated that 80 96 well plates of clones will be processed as part of this task. All clones will be sequence  in both directions using the aforementioned primers..  Task 2: Provide sequencing templates The contractor shall provide EPA with nucleic acid used as template for sequencing reactions. The nucleic acid could be in the form of plasmid or PCR product and it should be sent to project officer in a  frozen buffer to prevent degradation of extracted material. DELIVERABLES and DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE Both higher throughput and clean read outs (i.e., sequence electropherograms) are needed to complete this project. The readout has to be of high quality such that sequences obtained from clones  sequenced in both directions will overlap more than 75%.  Most clones will be of approximately 700 bp, but they could range between 400bp and 800 bp.  The primary output of each sequencing reaction should include a readout compatible with sequencing analysis software like Sequencher or DNA Star.  When clones are longer than 700 bases, the contractor shall provide a minimum of 650 bases per reaction of high quality (Phred  20).  Failure to accomplish this could require additional reactions.  As stated in Task 2, the contractor is expected to provide EPA with the remainder of the material  used for sequencing (i.e., purified plasmids or PCR products). To avoid nucleic acid degradation, the material should be shipped frozen to the project officer using overnight delivery.  The duration of the project is 12 months.  The contractor shall expect to deliver at least 25% of the total  analytical services herein requested every three months.  In other words, the contractor shall be capable of processing the minimum of 20 plates that will be submitted for sequencing during each three month period. All purified plasmids or PCR products should be sent to project officer at the end  each quarter. This acquisition is designated as a small business set aside under NAICS code 621511, the size standard of which is $11.5 million dollars. The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will  be issued on or about December 9, 2004. To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. Josh Bowers (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) by 10:00 AM EST THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2004. Requests submitted via email are preferred or a fax is acceptable. The fax number is  513-487-2109. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number, and email address.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 621511   NOTE: THIS REQUIREMENT WAS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE UNDER RFQ-OH-05-00016. AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION, THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO CONDUCT A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. THE TEXT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS BELOW: The National  Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, Ohio, intends to negotiate using full and open competition for a project entitled "DNA Sequencing for Augmentation."  The objective of this project is for a contractor to conduct sequencing of environmental clone libraries developed by EPA  personnel and provide sequencing data in electronic form. The contractor shall perform sequencing reactions on template provided by EPA personnel and provide sequence electropherograms to the project officer. The specific tasks are as follows:  Task 1: Sequencing of environmental clones The  primary task of this project is to generate sequence information from clone libraries. MCCB personnel will provide the DNA template that will be sequenced by the contractor in the form of bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli cells transformed with TA plasmid containing the PCR clones.  The  contractor shall perform the following steps: pick bacterial colonies and transfer colonies to growth medium, grow bacteria overnight at appropriate temperature, perform plasmid purifications and sequencing reactions, clean sequencing reactions, and perform sequencing electrophoresis. Sequencing  reactions will the performed with either M13F or M13R primers.  The primers will be provided by the sequencing company. It is estimated that 80 96 well plates of clones will be processed as part of this task. All clones will be sequence in both directions using the aforementioned primers..  Task  2: Provide sequencing templates The contractor shall provide EPA with nucleic acid used as template for sequencing reactions. The nucleic acid could be in the form of plasmid or PCR product and it should be sent to project officer in a frozen buffer to prevent degradation of extracted  material. DELIVERABLES and DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE Both higher throughput and clean read outs (i.e., sequence electropherograms) are needed to complete this project. The readout has to be of high quality such that sequences obtained from clones sequenced in both directions will overlap more than  75%.  Most clones will be of approximately 700 bp, but they could range between 400bp and 800 bp.  The primary output of each sequencing reaction should include a readout compatible with sequencing analysis software like Sequencher or DNA Star. When clones are longer than 700 bases, the contractor  shall provide a minimum of 650 bases per reaction of high quality (Phred  20).  Failure to accomplish this could require additional reactions.  As stated in Task 2, the contractor is expected to provide EPA with the remainder of the material used for sequencing (i.e., purified plasmids or PCR  products). To avoid nucleic acid degradation, the material should be shipped frozen to the project officer using overnight delivery.  The duration of the project is 12 months.  The contractor shall expect to deliver at least 25% of the total analytical services herein requested every three months.   In other words, the contractor shall be capable of processing the minimum of 20 plates that will be submitted for sequencing during each three month period. All purified plasmids or PCR products should be sent to project officer at the end each quarter. The NAICS code is 621511. The acquisition  will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about February 8, 2005. To receive a copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. Josh Bowers (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) by MONDAY  FEBRUARY 7, 2005 AT 10:00 AM EST. Requests submitted via email are preferred or a fax is acceptable. The fax number is 513-487-2109. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number, and email address.

NATIONALITY, SOURCE, AND ORIGIN REQUIREMENTS


The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the prefeasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, each of the following provisions shall apply to the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. individual; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., local lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions.  USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:

1)  Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. individual.  Prime contractors may utilize U.S. 
 
subcontractors without limitation, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.

2)  Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. individual may submit proposals on USTDA funded activities.  Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities.  U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals.  

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant.  

3)  Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a “U.S. firm” as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a “U.S. firm” if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
 

SOURCE AND ORIGIN:

1)  Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USTDA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees.  However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.

2)  Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 

3)  Definitions

“Source” means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin” means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.













Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to La Asociación Gremial de Exportadores de Productos No Tradicionales (AGEXPRONT) in Guatemala in the development and training of a digital certificates program. 

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to assist Guatemala in the development of a digital certificates program as well as a training program support structure for the effective dissemination of key information needed to enhance bilateral trade. The project has three key components:

1.	Training the Trainers in Market Intelligence: this component aims at building trade capacity for Guatemala by developing its human resources, providing training for a few dozen trainers (for the chambers of commerce and industry, universities, consultants, public sector officials and others) on trade and market intelligence issues.

2.	Enhancing Training Capabilities of AGEXPRONT: this component will examine and evaluate the training program presently run by AGEXPRONT and will assist this institution in providing increasingly sophisticated market information and information on Central America Free Trade Agreement to members and students at their Foreign Trade School for exporters.

3.	Advancing the Digital Certificates Program for the Single Export Window: this component involves working with AGEXPRONT to advance the Digital Certificates Project—a key missing piece of the Single Export Window—aimed at making certificates of origin and sanitary-phytosanitary certificates available to exporters electronically. The project will provide Technical Assistance to improve the network infrastructure related to the processing and handling of information related to Guatemalan exports. The project will also assist Guatemalan officials to develop a system for the exchange of certificates with the U.S. and the other CAFTA partners.


The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following:

Task One: Design Strategy in Cooperation with Grantee and Local Counterparts
	Task Two: Develop Content of Training Program with Local Counterparts
	Task Three: Strengthening AGEXPRONT’s Training Capability
	Task Four: Training the Trainers in Trade Information
	Task Five: Assist Trainers to Design and Conduct a Public Training Program
	Task Six:   Advancing the Digital Certificates Program

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W909MY05R0005
<RESPDATE>041105
<ARCHDATE>06102005
<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-05-R-0005, soliciting proposals in support of technical trade studies under the United Kingdom/United States of America Project Arrangement (PA) concerning Countermine Capabilities for Medium/Future Forces, has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  The BAA is sponsored by the U. S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communication - Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, NVE SD, Ft. Belvoir, VA and the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratories (Dstl).   This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of r esearch and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement. The United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defence (MOD) and United States (US) Army have signed a PA concerning Countermine Capabilities for Medium / Future Forces (PA # A-PA-UK-2003-0 107).  The focus of the PA is collaborative science and technology advancement leading to the development of a bilateral technology demonstrator.  This demonstrator will establish a capability baseline for embedded, vehicle mounted mine detection, neutrali zation, and marking for the Medium / Future Forces. The effort for this Project Arrangement will focus on key requirements and needs for anti-tank or anti-vehicle (AT/AV) mine detection neutralization, and marking.  The military operational scenario will b e on-route (primary and secondary roads) clearance specifically to demonstrate day and night capability to open and maintain lines of communications against AT/AV mine threats.  The intent is to ensure mobility of forces under different operational environ ments.  A system of systems approach is envisioned that may include precision AT/AV mine detection, confirmation of a mine location, marking of the mine location and safe lanes, and mine neutralization (destruction) capacities.  A goal of this PA is to det ermine the best approach (within the system of systems model) to accomplish all missions with the optimum ground vehicle platform(s) and mission payloads. The Project Arrangement is split into three phases of effort.  Phase I involves the generation of a s et of desired capabilities, which are agreed upon by consensus of UK and US counterparts. This work has been conducted on a Government-to-Government basis and will be made available to successful bidders. Under Phase II, technical trade-off studies are to be performed in order to select the best technological approach to meet the desired capabilities from Phase I.  The competitive Phase III will select one or more system integrators to build a technology demonstrator for the technologies that, after review of the trade studies, are deemed most likely to meet the PA requirements.  This BAA is soliciting proposals for Phase II of the PA. The Offeror shall propose various sensors, combinations of sensors, neutralization techniques and marking capabilities matur ing in the next 3-5 years; potential technical trade-off studies and combinations of those sensors and other technology demonstrator components, that may satisfy the desired system level capabilities of Phase I of the aforementioned Project Arrangement.  D ata generated under this BAA will be delivered with unlimited rights and shared under US and UK intergovernmental agreements. Phase I, which has been completed, generated the following capabilities matrix: Detection Accuracy: 10cm (Minimum), 5cm (Goal); Ro ute Width: 4 meters (Minimum), 6 (Goal); meters (4m road and 2m side); Detection ROA: 15 kih (Minimum), 30 kih (Goal); Residual Threat: 5% (Minimum), 3% (Goal); Casualties to system:10% or less (Minimum), 5% or less (Goal);  Depth (mine overburden): 13cm (Minimum), 20cm (Goal); Mine Marking (Physical):10cm (Minimum), 5cm (Goal); Safe Lane Marking (Physical): 50m (Minimum), 25m (Goal); Visible markers: 95% for 24  hours (Minimum), 98% for 24 hours (Goal); Reporting Accuracy: 30cm (Minimum), 10cm (Goal).  The UK and US Government will be conducting field collections with existing sensor hardware at locations in the US as well as in the UK.  These data will be provid ed to the selected Contractor(s) after award to aid in the analysis of alternative technologies.  There will be no hardware deliverables and no requirement for the selected Contractor(s) to collect data.  Prior to submittal of proposals, questions concerni ng technical issues may be directed to the attention of the NVESD and Dstl Countermine Subject Matter Experts (SME).  Background information can be found at http://conference.brtrc.com/ukus/.  The selection for contract award will be based on a scientific and engineering peer review evaluation of proposals.  The business and contractual aspects, including cost, will also be considered as a part of the evaluation.  Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. The purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed in each response to the BAA.  The proposal preparation instructions, specific evaluation criteria, and other general term s and conditions are set forth in the BAA.   Since there will be no other formal request for proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA, interested parties should be alert for any amendments to this BAA that may be published on the IBOP website.  This BAA will be open until 1 April 2005.  Offerors should download the BAA solicitation W909MY-05-R-0005 from the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  In order to be able to access the BAA, and su bmit a proposal, a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.   A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encourag ed to register as soon as possible.   The US and UK plan to conduct one-on-one meetings with potential offerors in the US from 1-4 March 2005 and in the UK from 8-11 March 2005.  Offerors should contact the Contracting Officer to schedule these meetings.

<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Jacksonville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company for the renourishment of the Broward Co unty beaches which were damaged as a result of last years hurricanes.  This work, which is limited to replacement of erosion losses attributed to the hurricanes, is authorized by PL 84-99.  To achieve maximum protection, the work should be completed prior  to the next hurricane season, which begins in June 2005.  The estimated quantity of beach fill required is approximately 244,000 cubic yards.  The length of beach to be renourished is estimated at 6.8 miles.  The borrow area is located approximately 5.0 t o 10.0 miles from the project site.  Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  The local sponsor of this project, the Broward County Department of Planning and Environmental Protection (DPEP), is also going to award a contract  for additional renourishment.  Physically, the material authorized by PL 84-99 must be placed prior to the countys additional material.  All material will come from the same borrow area.  At this time, DPEP plans to award their contract to Great Lakes Dr edge and Dock on or about February 1, 2005 and give them notice to proceed on or about February 4, 2005.  The DPEP is the permittee for the state Water Quality Certification and also has the Department of the Army permit for this renourishment.  For enviro nmental reasons, DPEP has indicated that they will not delay their contractor to allow the Corps of Engineers contractor to go first.   And, for logistical and environmental reasons, the county will not allow two separate contractors to work simultaneousl y. For these reasons, we believe Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is only source capable of performing this work within the required timeframe.

Interested parties may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement(s) with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<RESPDATE>013105
<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>UPDATE (1-20-05) FOURTH AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 4.  No time extension is anticipated as a result of these  changes.  The following is a summary of the major changes: The following sentences were added to Section L, Paragraph 3.3.3 (a) and are  written in pink to distinguish them from previous amendments:  "The offeror may  provide a seat-cover to protect the identity of their seat.  Seats must not  include any visible markings/decals/data plates identifying its manufacturer;  these markings must be removed or covered prior to delivery." The following sentence was added to Pricing Exhibit PA: "The Government  anticipates a delivery date of 9 MARO for the Integration Testing Shipsets." Lastly, although it is not an amendment, the  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc document has been corrected to more  accurately reflect the clauses that were changed.  Please note, this document  was provided for informational purposes only in an attempt to assist the  offerors.  In the event of a discrepancy between supporting documentation such  as this listing and the RFP, the RFP takes precedence.  The corrected document  has been reposted.   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-13-05) THIRD AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 3.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.         If you have any questions or concerns regarding this amendment or any aspect of  the ESUP program, please contact one or both of the contractual POC+s listed  below.  Please remember to begin any email subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-5-05) PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES All potential offerors are asked to provide a list of all the customers and  subcontractors+ customers expected to provide past performance questionnaires  for the ESUP source selection.  This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.  All  offerors are still responsible for ensuring that questionnaires are received  prior to the deadline.

In addition, answers to various questions and clarifications  have also been posted to clarify the changes found in the amendment and to  respond to questions or clarifications that did not result in a change to the  RFP.   An amendment changing the contract type from a "C" type contract to an "IDIQ"  type contract is still planned to be released in the near future.  Due to the  potential for inclement weather and various other factors, this amendment may  be released following the December 25th holiday rather than before.  For the  convenience of the offerors, this amendment will be a re-release of all  documents and will include all changes set forth in the first amendment as well  as those changes planned for the second amendment.

These two documents are for informational purposes only and have been  posted to provide insight into some of the changes made from the second draft  to the final solicitation.  They are not a complete list of the changes made.   In addition, aside from a few clarifications, all of this information should  all ready be contained in the final RFP.  Please note that in the event of a  conflict between what is said in the Questions and Answers and what is written  in the solicitation, the solicitation takes precedence.  If a conflict does  exist and an offeror requires clarification, please contact one of the  contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.   Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (12-1-04) REVISED FINAL RFP POSTED A revised copy of the Final RFP has been posted. The documents are now in the  proper order and several "Draft" notations have been removed.  No other changes  have been made to the document.  Please note that this is a huge file, and may  not open in your browser window in a timely manner.  You may need to save the  file to your computer prior to reviewing the documentation. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-30-04) FINAL RFP RELEASE The final RFP is hereby released.  Please note Section L was accidently  duplicated and there are two identical file copies.  In addition, the document  sections, most notably, the PCO letters, are out of order due to software  glitches. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-05-04) SECTION L AND M, CLINs and SECTION H POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the Sections L, M, and H and the  CLINs and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at  your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 11 Nov 2004.  If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below.

If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The total building gross square footage is approximately 1,462,628 square feet; this includes the two basement levels and the 32 floors above grade. At ground level, the building is adjoined on all four sides by a public plaza with landscaped planting areas and granite surfacing.

<DESC>This amendment is to revise RFP  HSBP1004R0247 by amending the following and to provide answers to questions:

1.	This contract has an existing union agreement.  The union agreement is made part of the RFP as attachment F.

2.	The SOW, attachment C has been amended and is replaced in its entirety.

3.	Attachment  B, Section B has been amended and replaced in its entirety.

4.	Block 9 of the SF33 is amended to add.    The current due date for the proposals is revised to February 15, 2005 at 3:00 PM.

5.	The cut off date for submitting questions is February 1, 2005 at 4:00 PM.



Questions concerning the RFP from various offeror’s.

1)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 5, Paragraph 1.7, and p. 16, Paragraph 1.13.4
 
RFP Question:  Reference is made to armed and unarmed guards and training requirements for both, yet RFP Attachment B, Attachment 3a, Guard Post Listing shows all posts as being armed. Which is correct? For pricing purposes, need to know which posts are armed and unarmed or is it the Government’s intention to use Guard II qualified individuals on all posts?

Answer : It is the government's intention to use Guard II qualified individuals on all posts.

2)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment 3b- Post Order and Attachment 3c-CBP SOP
 
RFP Question:  These post orders do not match the post numbers, types of posts or post times that are listed in RFP Attachment B, Attachment 3a, Guard Post Listing. Which attachment has precedence?  Please clarify.  

Answer : The modification has corrected this issue. 
 
3)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 15, Paragraph 1.12.4.3, and RFP Attachment B, Attachment 2
 
RFP Question: Contractor is directed not to remove firearms and to store weapons “using an approved weapons storage method.” Are there currently storage areas? How many ? Does each building require a dedicated storage area or are some (NDC1-NDC 5) sharing one storage location?

Answer:  There is one storage location to service all sites.

4)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment 6, Deduction Table, Item #5
 
RFP Question:   What is considered an “excessive” turnover rate and what is the amount of the deduction?

Answer: Excessive turnover rate as well as deduction amount are to be determined by the CO/COTR based on the circumstances.  The contractor will be allowed to participate in the discussion and present his/her case.
 
5)     RFP Reference: Delivery Schedule, CLIN 25, and RFP Attachment B, CLINs 25a and 25b
 
RFP Question: CLIN 025 in the Delivery Schedule is specified as a “Cost Reimbursement” item; Attachment B lists CLIN 25a as being “Other Direct Costs” (ODC) and CLIN 25b as “Transition Costs.” ODC normally covers travel and other miscellaneous items.  Does ODC apply to uniforms, firearms, and equipment? What does the Government allow to be included in CLIN 25b, 
Transition Costs? Does transition include recruiting, screening, training, recertification, etc.? Please clarify as it is critical to determine what costs might be eligible for cost reimbursement and which costs must be factored into G&A.

Answer : ODC covers special equipment and supplies, when required by the government, but does not cover standard-issue items such as uniforms and firearms.  ODC also does NOT cover costs relating to recruiting, screening, training, certifications/re-certifications, etc.

6)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 48, Section L.5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  The numbering of the Technical Proposal Required Response Format on RFP p. 48 and RFP p. 49 appear to conflict. RFP p. 48 specifies three sections: Section 1-   Transmittal Letter; Section 2- Executive Summary and Table of Contents; and Section 3- Technical Approach.  Yet RFP p. 49 -50 list six required sections beginning with Section 1, Overall Approach; Section 2- Personnel Resources & Staffing, etc. Should the six requirements on RFP p. 49-50 be listed as Sections 4-9 on the outline?

RFP Question:: Is Section 4, Offeror’s Addendum actually Section 10 (see above question) on the required outline rather than Section 4?
 
Answered above. 

8)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 53, Section M.2, Technical Evaluation Factors
 
RFP Question:  Technical Plan (D) and Corporate Experience (E) are not specified in Section L required outline. Are these plans the same as the Contract Management Plan and Current/Past Performance specified on RFP p. 49? Or, should the contractor add them to the required outline to follow the Transition Plan? 
 
Answer : Technical Plan (Item D in Section M) will be evaluated based on the information provided in the Overall Approach (Section L, B, Section 3, Item 1), Subcontracts and Consulting Arrangements (L,B,3,5), and Transition Plan (L,B,3,6), as well as information provided in other sections as it relates the Technical Plan.

9)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Contract Management Plan the same plan as the Management Plan specified on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?

Answer : Contract Management Plan in Section L is the same as Management Plan in Section M.
 
10)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Personnel Resources and Staffing Plan the same plan as the Staffing Plan specified on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?
 
Answer : Yes, they are the same.

11)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 49-50, Section L5, General Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals
 
RFP Question:  Is the Current/Past Performance Section the same requirement as  Corporate Experience  (E) on RFP p. 53 or a separate requirement? If a separate requirement, where should the contractor address it in the Section L Outline?
 
Answer : Yes, they are the same.

12)     RFP Reference: RFP p. 53, Section M.2, Evaluation Criteria
 
RFP Question:  The Evaluation Criteria do not appear to match the required response items in Section L.5. For example, the Subcontracts and Consulting Agreements and Transition Plan described on RFP p. 50-51 are not part of the evaluation criteria. Please clarify.

Answered above.
 
13)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, Paragraph 1.2.3, p. 3
 
RFP Question:  Here the Transition Plan is required 20 days after contract award, yet RFP p. 50, Section L.5, requires the transition plan with proposal submittal. Which is correct?

Answer: An initial Transition Plan describing the general approach to the taking over the contract from the incumbent is required with the proposal.  A more detailed Transition Plan, if needed, will be prepared by the contractor and provided to the government within 20 days of contract award.
 
14)     RFP Reference: RFP Attachment B, p. 2, Paragraph 1.1.2.14, and RFP Attachment B, p.22
 
RFP Question:  Reference is made to a QA Plan and Exhibits, and RFP Attachment B, p. 22 refers to Attachment 7 (Small and Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan) and Attachment 8 (QA Plan including Exhibits).  RFP Attachments 7 and 8 were not provided. Please provide
 
Answer: The original attachment 7 referring the Small Business was removed without references to it being removed.  The current Attachment 7 used to be Attachment 8 and should have been referred to as Training Plan rather than QA Plan.

<DESC>This modification is to modify the response date, no other changes have been made.

Response Date: February 4, 2005

This announcement is posted as a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The Bureau of Prisons is conducting Market Research that may result in a future solicitation being posted on the Federal Business Opportunity (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  This RFI is issued to determine whether there are qualified sources that will be able to meet the requirements, as well as, allow industry an opportunity to provide comment concerning the requirement.  The requirement is for Re-Entry and Service Planning (RASP) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of the United States Statutes with special medical and/or mental health needs who are releasing or transferring to community-based programs from Bureau institutions. 

Sources are sought who can provide service plans, program referrals, and scheduling for community treatment and support services, (e.g., mental health, medical, Social Security Income (SSI), housing assistance, substance abuse treatment, etc.) for the time period immediately following the inmate’s release from custody or transfer to a community-based program.   Sources should provide comments concerning, or sources for; 1) the development of structured and comprehensive re-entry and service plans (RASP) ; and 2) the referral and scheduling of necessary treatment and services for specifically identified offenders in advance of their re-entry to the community. 
   
A previous sample of releasing federal offenders revealed that around 15 percent of releasees had a severe medical and/or mental health problems.  Of this group, approximately 60 percent were released directly to the community and the remainder were transferred to Community Corrections Centers (CCC), also known as halfway houses, or Home Confinement.   About 18 percent of this group were diagnosed with a severe mental health problem-only and 72 percent were diagnosed with a medical condition and/or a co-occurring mental health problem.  Such diagnoses require swift and certain follow-up during the inmate’s  re-entry to the community.  During fiscal year 2004, approximately 50,000 offenders were released from BOP institutions.  Estimates based on our previous sample, indicate that about 7,500 of these offenders would have benefitted from RASP type services.   Traditionally, Bureau staff coordinate release planning for offenders leaving Bureau custody or transferring to CCCs.   However, to provide additional re-entry services to higher need offenders, the Bureau is exploring various planning options.  Linking offenders in need of specialized treatment and program services is essential to ensuring a continuum of care during the re-entry period.  

RASP development would be done on a case-by-case basis.  This would be based on case specific documentation which would be supplied by Bureau staff.  Bureau staff would be available for clarifying information as needed.  Only in rare circumstances would actual interviews with offenders take place.  Based upon the RASP, referrals for identified services would be made and any necessary treatment and/or service appointments would be scheduled (contingent upon the inmate’s identified release date).  After the RASP is developed and all necessary scheduling completed, the RASP and referral information would be returned to Bureau staff. 

Sources should describe their ability to develop a transition treatment plan and the existing relationships which demonstrate their ability to link offenders with the services identified in the  treatment plan. These services will include, but are not limited to: 

•	medical and mental health assessments;
•	medical and mental health treatment; 
•	continuation/follow-up prescriptions for medication;
•	services for those with developmental disabilities;
•	employment services; 
•	housing assistance; 
•	substance abuse treatment and/or support services; 
•	educational/vocational referrals; 
•	parenting skills; 
•	family counseling and reintegration into the family;
•	SSI/Social Security Disability (SSD) applicant advocacy;
•	public assistance advocacy; and
•	child care referrals.   

The Bureau operates over 107 federal institutions across the country and offenders often release from institutions geographically distance from their proposed release residence, complicating service and treatment linkages.  Consequently, the responses must include the a description of the responder’s ability and/or approach to provide services on a State-wide, regional or national basis.  

Your response should be no more than ten pages, and should include a discussion of the viability of the re-entry and service planning approach. Responses shall be addressed to Sheila Thompson, Contracting Officer via email at sthompson@bop.gov.

INTRODUCTION
Many of the problems of brick masonry, brought to the attention of the Brick Institute of America over the past years, have resulted from improper cleaning methods. Some walls have been irreparably damaged as a result of a lack of attention to cleaning details and procedures.
Cleaning failures generally fall into one of three categories: 
1. Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of the cleaning solution and may result in "mortar smear", "white scum", or the development of efflorescence or "green stain". Saturation of the surface prior to cleaning reduces the absorption rate, permitting the cleaning solution to stay on the surface rather than be absorbed.
2. Failure to properly use chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid solutions can etch or wash out cementitious materials from the mortar joints. They have a tendency to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently termed "acid burn" and can also promote the development of "green" and "brown" stains. 
3. Failure to protect windows, doors, and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions, have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials, such as limestone and cast stone.
Before the actual cleaning of a project begins, all cleaning procedures and solutions should be applied to a sample test area of approximately 20 sq. ft. (1.9 m2). The effectiveness of the cleaning agent should be judged by inspection of the sample test area after a period of not less than one week after application. The size of the test area may be larger, depending upon the cleaning procedure. The indiscriminate use of muriatic acid or the wrong proprietary compound can cause unsightly, difficult-to-remove stains. Reactions of brick and cleaning solutions are not always predictable and thus it is safer to use a trial-and-error method on a small test area before committing the entire project to a set procedure. Minute quantities of certain minerals found in some fired clay masonry units and materials, such as manganese, added to color brick may react with some solutions and cause staining. Sample testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that will closely approximate the conditions under which the brickwork will be cleaned. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature is 50 oF (10 oC) or above. 
Pressurized Water Cleaning
To cut labor costs, many cleaning contractors utilize pressurized water. Some pressure systems feature a pressure gun and nozzle equipped with a control switch. This setup permits the operator to apply solutions to a wall over 100 ft. (30.5 m) from the base unit. Other systems have two separate hoses - one with plain water and the other with a cleaning solution. Low pressure has been defined as 100 to 300 psi (700 to 2100 kPa), medium pressure as 300 to 700 psi (2100 to 4850 kPa) and high pressure as 700 psi (4850 kPa) or greater. A sand finish or a surface coating may be removed by pressurized water cleaning, resulting in a different appearance. Nozzle pressure in excess of 700 psi (4850 kPa) may damage brick units and erode mortar joints.
The following procedure is suggested:
1. Select and test the cleaning solution on a sample area. Check the equipment for cleaning solution compatibility. For proprietary compounds, mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Presoak wall.
3. Protect metal, glass, wood, limestone and cast stone surfaces. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions.
4. Presoak or saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water, from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below should also be saturated in order to prevent absorption of the run-off from above
5. Application of cleaning solutions may be by a low pressure sprayer, 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa), or through the high pressure cleaning unit.
6. Permit the cleaning solution to remain on the wall for approximately 5 minutes.
7. Starting at the top, flush the wall down, as in the previous procedure.
Caution: It is possible for solutions to be driven into the masonry when applied under high pressure, and become the source of future staining. However, if the walls are sufficiently saturated with water before the solutions are applied, the risk of penetration is reduced. Experience has shown that this cleaning method has a high probability of changing the appearance of sand molded brick, sand- faced extruded brick, and brick with glazed coatings or slurries applied to the finished faces. The brick manufacturer should be consulted on the use of high pressure water cleaning of such brick.


SURFACE PREPARATION
 
********************************
Specifier Notes: Describe surface preparation of substrates required before application of water repellents.
********************************
 
A. Clean all dirt, oil, grease, mold, mildew, efflorescence, or any other coating or material from surfaces that interfere with penetration, performance, adhesion, or aesthetics of water repellents. Rinse thoroughly, using pressure water spray to remove cleaner residues. Allow surfaces to dry completely before application of water repellents.
 
B. Repair, patch, and fill all cracks, voids, defects, and damaged areas in surface as approved by the COR. Allow repair materials to cure completely before application of water repellents.
 C. Seal all open joints.
 D. Allow new masonry and concrete repairs and repointed surfaces to cure before application of water repellents

WATER REPELLENTS
. This specification covers preparation, materials, services, and equipment required for the application of Water Sealant products for projects involving either old or new construction.  Any substantial deviations shall be referred to the manufacturer or authorized representative. Product is manufactured in three strengths, which vary in solids content.  The determination of which formulation is appropriate is dependent upon the porosity of the substrate. Surface type may be concrete, brick, block, stone, stucco, wood and other porous building materials, which allow penetration of the sealant.

A. Surface Preparation: Contractor or Applicator shall be responsible for providing a clean, dry substrate free from oil, dirt, grease, efflorescence or any other coating which may inhibit penetration and adhesion of water repellent.  This requirement applies to new construction, renovation or remedial projects. Substrate must be completely dry prior to applying product.
B.  Environmental Requirements:
1. Temperature: Product may be applied at any temperature providing that there is no frozen moisture present in the substrate.

TITLE: ADVANCED COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-03 -IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800 

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 July 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 6 Jan 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The intent of seeking advanced computing architectures is to explore computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by C2, ISR, and strike systems in order to establish, maintain, and exploit information superiority.  Evolution in computing performance, capacity, and adaptability will lead to extraordinary advances in warfighter capabilities and the systems they depend upon each day.  By broadening and increasing the cognitive capabilities of the computing infrastructure the advantages the warfighter has in filtering, detecting, tracking, fusion, and situational assessment can be unmatched.  Achieving, demonstrating, and fielding these cognitive advances in a constructive methodical manor is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.
The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate advanced computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of emerging advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems. This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include data intensive processing architectures, power aware processing architectures, polymorphic processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, clockless logic, grid computing, data storage, data visualization, data busses, mobile and wireless networks. Examples of software technologies include programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, and resource management. (2) Development of novel computing architectures that facilitate evolutionary computing (EC) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), etc. for solving hard, NP-complete optimization problems.  Research in this area could address design tools for mapping algorithms and fitness function evaluation engines onto hardware/software systems, achieving extreme solution speeds, problem size scaling, physical miniaturization and power minimization of the physical platform.  Also of interest would be research aimed at employing EC methods to enhance and optimize the design process for composing such hardware/software systems, and applications of these technologies to specific optimization problems of interest to the Information Directorate. (3) Development of technologies supporting utilization of hybrid computation systems such as quantum or biomolecular computing combined with conventional CMOS Silicon systems. New algorithms and architectures, for interfaces between conventional electronic systems and systems based on new operations paradigms, are needed to transduce information in the most efficient manner.  This will enable development of hybrid systems with unique capabilities beyond general computing, such as intrinsic contextual addressing and computing. (4) Modeling and Simulation. Development of virtual real time modeling and simulation methods to enable more human intuitive design processes. Research in this area would focus on demonstrating extreme speed-ups of modeling and simulation engines used in present or proposed design environments, in order to achieve near real time inspection of the effect of changes made to a device or information system design.  This research area would also encompass fast methods to cast models and simulation engines into parallel and embedded processing platforms. In addition this area includes the development of simulation technology to perform rapid assessment and course of action analysis of the predictive battlespace environment. Examples of these particular technologies include: real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, M&S for wargaming, behavior representation, predictive assessment of adversarial actions, adversary intent inferencing, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of dynamic planning/execution, and real-time decision support. (5) Development of hardware and software processing architectures and techniques to enhance mechanisms of intelligence leading to cognizant computing.  Examples might be learning algorithms, knowledge creation techniques, storage or computation media physically addressed by a context mechanism such as resonance or stochastic summation, or distributed processing where each of many parallel sensing devices, has its own processor that does significant data interpretation/reduction. (6) Development of information technology leading to the advancement or demonstration of autonomous systems for enabling improved situational awareness, situational management, and situational control of the battlespace. This area includes all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing awareness and response through processing, reconfigurability, networking, communication, teaming, and control of ground, air, and/or space platforms.

This Sources Sought notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirements as stated below.  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a Request For Proposal.  The Government is not obligated and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package not longer than 10 pages, which demonstrates an ability to perform the services described below.  Potential sources may submit resumes or personnel information, including the company name, point of contact, business size, and company profile.  Potential sources should also describe any previous contracts that are similar in size and scope to this effort.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Washington, DC, is seeking sources to support Federal Housing Administration Subsidiary Ledger (FHASL).  The FHASL project leverages PeopleSoft’s Enterprise suite of Financial Management, Revenue Management and Customer Relationship Management software products as the core application to support the insurance, claims, asset management, funds control and financial reporting functions of the Federal Housing Administration.  To assist with the implementation, testing, documentation, training, and user support efforts, FHA needs a complementary software product that includes self-running and interactive simulations, assessments, in-application support and context-sensitive help, documentation, and training materials.  The specific requirements for this product include: 1) As delivered, the ability to integrate directly with PeopleSoft Enterprise Financials, Human Resources, CRM and Revenue Management without use of complex programming steps, 2) Ability to support content (i.e., simulations and documentation) development and training for other products, such as Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes, 3) Ability to create content as part of an interactive recording session that can be performed by a non-technical or novice system user, 4) Structured user training and documentation available to support developer/user learning, 5) Ability to create content in a matter of minutes from a single development effort, 6) Use of object recognition capability so content will be automatically created, 7) Ability to recognize PeopleTools level objects, especially those that result from modifications, 8) Ability to enhance content, including the creation of hot spots and text boxes without the need for "back end" programming, 9) Ability to design and deploy content using a web-browser (i.e., no plug-ins), 10) Ability to provide multiple training simulation (eLearning) modes simultaneously, from a self-guided tutorial to a user skills validation mode, 11) Ability to provide simulation without updating or altering the PeopleSoft system database, 12) Ability to provide an actual help simulation for production environment activities, rather than just end-user training prior to production use, 13) Ability to capture all actions, including function key usage and double-clicking, without the need to set variables such as timing and properties, 14) Automatic capability to provide usage tracking and scoring on user testing, and the ability to record scores in an outside database, 15) Ability to provide a centralized, reusable document repository that can create test scripts, training guides, job aides and business process-based documents, 16) Ability to support multiple fonts styles (five or more) including those that match the PeopleSoft environment, 17) Ability to export content files in multiple formats, including HTML and .DOC, and the ability to create HUD specific document templates, 18) Ability to migrate between different platforms (i.e., platform independence), and 19) Ability to create low overhead files in the data content repository. The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price contract with a period of performance of five (5) years.  At this time, a solicitation is not available.  Interested sources are requested to submit the capability statement package no later than 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday January 25, 2005, to the designated point-of-contact, Carol Pope-Stewart, via email to Carol_Pope-Stewart@hud.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Algorithmic Method for Determining Level of Assurance of Identity in Electronic Business Transactions
<SOLNBR>---
<RESPDATE>033105
<CONTACT>Valerie Syed, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email SyedV@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>The NIH Center for Information Technology, supporting the E-Authentication Partnership, is seeking to identify individuals and/or organizations capable of extending an initial algorithmic model for determining levels of assurance of identity (LOA) for electronic identity credentials used in e-commerce and e-government. An early model for developing such a method has been proposed by the E-Authentication Partnership, and there is an implicit assumption that this model may be extended into a reliable method for determining electronic identity credentials LOA.

Background

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget, following the lead of the Federal Public Key Infrastructure PKI Policy Authority, has established four (4) LOA: minimal assurance of identity; moderate assurance of identity, substantial assurance of identity and high assurance of identity. These levels are arbitrary in that no objective metrics are associated with them. They do, however, summarize the spectrum of assurance. 

The technical guidance designed to help government agencies determine which LOA a particular credential is issued at addresses the two general categories of identity proofing and credential management largely in terms of how well any particular implementation mitigates risk. The four LOA called out by the Federal government are not unreasonable, and certainly cover the vast majority of circumstances likely to be met in real world implementations of e-commerce and e-government.

There is an alternative to positioning an arbitrary number of LOA, whether two, four, five or seventeen. That is to develop an algorithm that (more or less) accurately models the factors involved in identity proofing and credential management. The output of the algorithm is a number that represents Assurance of Identity for each instance of credential issuance for all degrees of identity proofing and credential management. The spectrum in identity proofing would run from no assertion of identity all the way to absolutely validated assertion of identity. All credentials, from self-selected UserID/password pairs through biometrically-protected, hardware tokenized digital certificates, fall along a spectrum of reliability. 

Both identity proofing and credential management are familiar activities, for which the requirements are well-understood. In general, auditing standards address requirements for both. It should therefore be possible to build an algorithm to generate “objective” scores for all instances of identity proofing and all instances of credential management and to use those range of scores to develop a mathematical model that describes an “objective” set of LOA with numeric ranges. 

Such an algorithmic approach requires more analytical work, done by professionals with specialist skills and knowledge, in order to deliver a useful, viable model. The current E-Authentication Partnership workgroup studying the problem has neither the resources nor the time necessary to build such a model.

A full description of the “algorithmic model” for determining LOA is available at the following URL: http://pki.od.nih.gov/NIH4pilot/AL_PolicyDoc_v1_0.doc.

This Source Sought/Request for Information (RFI) requests information about similar statistical models, or comments on the feasibility of the algorithmic model. Assuming viability, we are interested in how to extend the model and further develop it so that it may be used as a standard reference methodology for determining LOA for all categories of electronic identity credentials and information about entities capable of performing these tasks.

This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be constructed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government may or may not solicit a requirement on the basis of responses, nor can it pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government’s use of such information. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Should a solicitation materialize as a result of this Sources Sought/RFI, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or Government’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. Respondents will be notified of the results of the response to this Sources Sought/RFI. Any proprietary information should be so marked and it will be kept confidential. 

Responses should be identified with NIH-CIT-SOURCES SOUGHT/RFI-05-001, and are welcome until March 31, 2005. Please submit your response electronically to both Dr. Peter Alterman, Assistant CIO for E-Authentication, Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, at peter.alterman@nih.gov and Valerie M.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-01-21-2005_Office_Supplies_Sources_Sought
<RESPDATE>020405
<ARCHDATE>02192005
<CONTACT>Robert Ransom, Chief, Phone 301-713-0820 x108, Fax (301) 713-0806, Email robert.ransom@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in identifying venders capable of providing office supplies to support its ongoing operations.  During government fiscal year 2004, NOAA acquired over $4 million worth of office supplies using thousands of purchase card transactions and over 50 different contractual agreements.  A majority of its purchases were made using a credit card and were categorized under Federal Supply Codes 7510, 7520 and 7530, NAICS Code 424120.
NOAA’s demand for office supplies emanates primarily from its buying offices located in Silver Spring, Maryland, Norfolk, Virginia; Kansas City, Missouri; Boulder, Colorado; and Seattle, Washington.  Supplies were delivered to these locations, as well as other NOAA offices throughout the United States.  

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  NOAA desires to identify vendors capable of meeting NOAA’s demands for office supplies with discounted pricing (based on prospective order volume) and create an efficient ordering process that accepts the Federal credit card (Visa) and automatically obtains certain supplies from mandatory sources of supply (e.g., UNICORE, JWOD, NISH).  NOAA is interested in hearing from vendors and learning about the type and extent of office supplies that can be provided as well as the most effective method(s) for acquisition.  Ultimately, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more contracts to vendors, or Blanket Purchase Agreements to vendors holding GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts.  In any event, the vendor must accept a credit card as the means of payment.  NOAA is particularly interested in identifying small or small disadvantaged, women owned, service disabled veteran owned, or qualifying hubzone businesses capable of meeting its needs.  Finally, in order to ensure NOAA complies with Federal mandates to acquire certain supplies from required sources of supply, NOAA is interested in identifying vendors with business ties to these sources.

Some of the key issues NOAA is interested in learning more about are:
1.	The type and extent of vendors capable of providing office supplies to NOAA (FSC Code 75, NAICS Code 424120).
2.	The extent to which one vendor can meet some or all of NOAA’s potential total order volume.
3.	The socio-economic category and size status of each vendor
4.	The extent vendors have contracts with GSA’s Federal Supply Schedule
5.	The method that supplies will be provided to NOAA (e.g. direct ship from warehouse/wholesaler or from retail office location)
6.	The feasibility and potential added cost (if any) of on-site restocking of supplies for various NOAA offices in multiple locations.
7.	The extent that e-commerce ordering can be accommodated including online product catalogs and order placement.
8.	The types of agreements the vendor has to offer products provided by Federal required sources of supply such as UNICORE, JWOD, NISH, etc.  
9.	The extent of discount off retail and/or GSA/FSS prices that could be offered.  

SUBMITTING A RESPONSE:  Interested firms with capability to provide office supplies to NOAA are invited to provide a written response that addresses each of the issues identified above, and any other ideas or concerns.  All responses must be submitted to Robert Ransom no later than 12:00 Noon (EST) on February 4, 2005.  The response should be submitted electronically via email with no more then two attachments to robert.ransom@noaa.gov or in paper form to Robert E. Ransom, Contracting Officer, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7604, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.  

The vender’s cover letter should be no longer than 2-pages and include a description of the firm including the type of business, central contractor registration status, location, current size and socio-economic status, GSA/FSS MAS Contract Number (if any), DUNS Number, tax identification number, points of contact – names, phone, fax, email.  The vendor may also include catalogs for office supplies currently offered as well as pricing and prospective discounts.

Questions and comments may be directed to the Contracting Officer by email only at robert.ransom@noaa.gov.

<DESC>This is a request for information only.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking sources that may be capable of  providing aqueous parts washers.  The aqueous parts washer desired would consist of a  front loading cleaning cabinet with fully adjustable spray nozzles designed in such a manner as to allow for both vertical and horizontal flow patterns that will ensure efficient and thorough cleaning of soiled parts.  The system will utilize environmentally safe detergent in an aqueous solution onto soiled parts. The system will be entirely closed-loop, with no water discharge. The combination of high temperature and stronghigh blast pressure enables the washers to remove the contaminants (dirt, grime, oil, grease, and fluorescent penetrants) from the parts, parts basket or rack and bag filter. These parts washers will be used to clean brake drums, wheels (including ground support equipment and aircraft wheels), bearings (not aircraft), engine parts (including blocks), and electric motors within a 15-minute wash cycle. 
 
 The Aqueous Parts Washer should meet the following requirements:

·	The high-pressure, hot water shall be used in conjunction with a biodegradable detergent to remove dirt, grime, oil, grease and fluorescent penetrants from the materials being cleaned as well as prevent the parts from flash rusting. Because the detergent solution shall be biodegradable, tThe solution should be capable of being able to be discharged into the local sewer system if it meets the discharge limitations. The detergents used should contain de-foamers and rust inhibitors to prevent flash rusting. The APW shall have a reservoir for the detergent.

·	The APW shall provide for an optional wastewater evaporator system to reduce the amount of wastewater removal required. 

·	The APW shall have a purifying/recycling system, whereby the detergent solution is recycled and can be reused. These closed-loop systems should enable the user to reuse the detergent solution as many times as possible before requiring a fresh solution.  The APW shall have an automatic system to determine when a fresh solution is required. When this occurs, the solution ratio (mixing of water and soap) shall be accomplished automatically and shall be adjustable and lockable. The APW shall have a lock out feature that would not permit operation of the APW if a fresh solution is required but has not been accomplished.

·	Only MIL-C-29602  biodegradable detergents shall be used with the APW. The detergent used must have rust inhibiting agents to protect the machine and steel parts being cleaned. 

·	All wetted parts and plumbing of the APW shall be constructed of materials that will prevent internal corrosion.

·	The inside working dimensions of the APW shall be approximately 40” high by 40” wide by 40” deep (or a 40” turntable diameter) 

·	The APW shall have a parts rack system design that will utilize most of the maximize the available washing space and increase cleaning efficiency. The rack system shall be able to handle at least a 2,000 lbs. weight capacity.

·	The nozzle system shall be fully adjustable so as to ensure thorough cleaning of parts of all shapes & sizes as well as to ensure proper distance from parts.  The cleaning system may include both a turntable and rotating nozzle system if deemed more efficient.

·	The APW shall have an easy to use seven-day timer.  

·	The APW shall have a door design that eliminates need for seals (i.e. a Labyrinth door design) and incorporates a large glass viewing area so that the operator can make sure that the adjustable nozzle system is in optimum position for most efficient cleaning.

·	The APW shall have preventative maintenance warning indicators to notify personnel of necessary maintenance. The APW shall have a lock out feature that would not permit operation of the APW if critical maintenance actions have not been followed and filter cleanliness not established. It shall also have an automatic low water shutoff feature. 

·	The APW shall be easy to install.  It shall employ a self-contained venting system not requiring building mods (such as cutting holes into the ceiling, etc).

·	The APW shall have bag house filter systems that would not allow the filter housing to inadvertently open up during operation.

·	The APW shall provide clear identification plates on the unit to explain operation.

<DESC>This notification is a Request for Information to assist the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in an assessment process on how to best proceed in creating an efficient and effective framework for tracking True Out-of-Pocket costs (TrOOP) under the Medicare Part D program.  Comments are invited by February 4, 2005 and can be submitted to TrOOP@cms.hhs.gov.  A draft Statement of Work will be found shortly on the CMS website as well.  CMS will not be responding to specific questions/comments.  CMS is soliciting comments for providing information to the PDP and MA/PDP that will allow for the most accurate calculations of the beneficiary's TrOOP under the Medicare Part D program.  CMS' requirements will include, but not be limited to, the coordination of enrollment file sharing, claims process and payment, application of the protection against high out of pocket expenditures by tracking these costs and the annual out of pocket threshold.  CMS envisions a system of information sharing between CMS, Medicare Part D plans, pharmacies, State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SAPS), group health plans, insurers, and other third party arrangments.  Our goal is to leverage, to the extent feasible, the capabilities of existing architectures, standards, and business processes that are part of current industry practices.  Pharmacies are a key partner to the process of ensuring that the benefit is delivered properly to the beneficiary and the best solution would be one that is familiar to our partners that have to receive and deliver the benefit.  Subsequent to this notice, CMS will use the same reference number and post additional background information, diagrams, and more information on specific points that should be addressed by those providing comments.  It is recommended that interested parties register through this notice in order to be alerted to all subsequent notices under this same reference number.

<DESC>This synopsis announces the final decision of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on a Streamlined Cost Comparison Study under OMB Circular A-76 of 18 FTE in the Data Collection and Analysis function (Function Code D200).  On September 23, 2004, the FHWA publicized its intent to conduct a streamlined competition for 18 Federal FTE who collect, analyze, summarize, assure the quality of the data, and disseminate a wide variety of data and information concerning (1) the Nation’s highways and FHWA; and (2) assessment of internal program policies and activities. The 18 personnel are located at FHWA’s Headquarters in Washington, DC, and in FHWA field offices located in Illinois, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. The authority and procedures for the competition are found in the revised Circular A-76, Attachment B, dated May 29, 2003.  As a result of the streamlined competition, it has been determined that it is more cost effective for the work to be performed by the incumbent Federal staff; accordingly, this announcement represents public notice, as required by the Circular, that this work will remain in-house. The Streamlined Competition Form (SLCF) documenting this decision was certified by three individual independent Agency officials.

<DESC>The 20th Contracting Squadron, Shaw AFB, S.C. is requesting a quote on the following Brand Name or equal item:  GENTEX Corporation Light Vehicle Intercom System.  Vehicle mounted crew intercom system capable of rapidly scaling from four to eight user positions.  Four positions are within the vehicle's cab (5-10 ft cable distance), and four positions are in the rear crew compartment (20 ft cable distance).  Vehicle battery voltage is 24VDC.  The intercom must connect to two main vehicle-mounted radios and each user position must have access to transmit and receive on a selectable radio via Push-To-Talk (PTT) buttons.  PTT buttons are requested to be clipped to a user's body armor or belt, but other design options will be entertained and reviewed on an individual basis.  Vehicle mounted radios can include any combination of Motorola XTS5000 with XTVA vehicle adapters, Harris AN/PRC-117(F), or ITT SINCGARS family of radios.  Radio interface cables will be included with the system.  Further, communication among stations in the same vehicle must have the ability to toggle between PTT or always-on intercom transmission ("hot" intercom mics with no radio transmission).  Each station must have a slim-fitting headset with boom microphone that is capable of fitting beneath the PASGAT helmet.  Each headset cable must have a friction break-away connection that will automatically disconnect the use from the intercom system upon exiting without requiring the user to twist cables or manually unlock the connection.  Each user headset/PTT set must also have a spar or "Y" connection to interface with a stand-alone Motorola XTS5000.  Upon break-away, the PTT button and radio access will be routed to the handheld XTS5000.  The spar or "Y" connection cable should be removable so the feature can be implemented only when deemed necessary in the field.  Further, one position will have a foot switch for intercom PTT.  Overall system size is extremely important.  Control boxes should be mountable, numbers should be kept to a minimum, and unit should be as small as possible. This is a combine synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The new NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI requires a remotely operated submersible vehicle (ROV) for the ship-based field research.  The HI'IALAKAI will support government organizations conducting research throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.  

2.0	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPE OF WORK

The diversity of ecosystem monitoring and assessment projects to be supported by the HI'IALAKAI requires the ROV to be capable of:
o	Reliable operation in a remote offshore environment, at time in open ocean currents, to a depth of 2,000 feet (600m).
o	Steady maneuvering near potentially rugged coral on the seafloor, at times making contact with the bottom.  This requires high power to weight ratio and a low center of gravity.
o	Using a video camera system with operator display
o	Staging from ship's deck.  This requires portability and straightforward control features.
o	Field maintainable, without special tools or training.
o	Option for later field upgrade, to add a manipulator arm.
Piloting of the ROV must be sufficiently intuitive for relatively inexperienced technicians, and as such NOAA requires that the ROV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product with a proven design and a number of completed previous deliveries.  Minor modifications to a standard package to meet requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package is not acceptable.

3.0	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The required remotely operated vehicle (ROV) performance and features are listed in the following, grouped by Selection Evaluation Factors (see paragraph 6.0).  Specific responses requested from offerors are indicated in bold type in the SOW.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NO. BBGCON0805S5492 POSTED ON JANUARY 11, 2005 FOR R—ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES.  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 19.502-2(b), the Contracting Officer has set aside this acquisition for small business participation because there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses.  Thereby, this requirement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside.    Following are answers to questions that were submitted by interested offerors:   Question  (Q)1 -  What is the total number of positions to be staffed? Answer (A) 1 -  The solicitation requires the offeror to use its best judgment and expertise for the number of people required for this effort.  Q 2 -  When are proposals due?  A2 -  2:00pm EST, January 28, 2005.  Q3 - Is there an incumbent contractor for this work?  A3- Yes.  Q4 - If so, who is it?  A4 -  Federal Management Systems, Inc. (FMS).  Q5 -  Does this work qualify for a set-aside?  A5 -  Yes, the notice has been amended to set-aside this requirement for small businesses. 
Q6 -  What accounting applications are the BBG and IBB utilizing?  A6 -  The Federal Financial Systems.
Q7 -  Is this procurement the result of a follow-on/recompete of a previous incumbent contract?  If so, please provide me with the following (in order of importance):  a) Contract Number, b) Contractor Name, c) Estimated Contract Value, d) Award Date, and e) Period of Performance.  A7 -  a) Contract No. GS-10F-0173K /Delivery Order No. BBG-D04-08-2002 (including Modification Nos. 1-4; b) Federal Management Systems, Inc.; c) $180,000.00; d) July 26, 2005; e) August 2, 2004 through February 28, 2005. Q8 -  Is there an incumbent?  If so, why is this contract being re-bid?  A8 -  Yes, there is an incumbent.  The present contracted services were ordered only for a short period, based upon urgent and compelling reasons, until a new full term contract is competed and awarded.
Q9 -  Why is this procurement not a Small Business Set-Aside? A9 -  As amended herein, this requirement is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Q10 -  If there is an incumbent, is their current level of performance considered acceptable?  A10 -  Yes, their current level of performance is acceptable, however, improvements could be made.  This is because the present requirement was initially awarded for a short term.  Now that BBG is competing for a possible 5- year term, we want permanent solutions to the shortcomings of the present requirement.  Q11 - If there is an incumbent, are they eligible to compete?
A11 -  Yes, if the incumbent is a small business for this applicable NAICS code, as are all small businesses.
Q12 -  What is the current Level of Effort?  A12 -  Please refer to the answer to Question No. 7 above.
Q13 -  Would the government consider only requiring resumes for the base positions only, as opposed to base positions and additional positions? A13 -  No.  Q14 -  Who are the key personnel and what are the resume requirements?  A14 -   Key personnel aren’t identified. However, be advised that each person assigned to this requirement has to obtain in a timely fashion, a BBG and State Department systems clearance in order to perform their functions.  Q15 -  a) Are the proposed services currently being provided by an existing contractor? b) If so, is the current contractor eligible to bid on the proposed RFP?  A15 - a) Yes.  b)  Please refer to the answer to Question No. 11 above.  Q16 -  a) What is the current staffing and hours for the proposed RFP.  b) How many personnel are currently staffed?  c) What are their classifications? d) What is the total number of hours incurred for the proposed services by classification in prior years?  A16 -  a) See A17 below.  The answers to the remaining questions are available through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Q17 -  In order to provide a comparable basis, are there an estimated number of hours anticipated for each proposed staffing classification?  
A17 -  2080 hours per person annually, as stated in Section (v) of the RFP.  Q18 -  How many resumes are required to be submitted in the proposal for each staffing classification?  A18 -  The number of resume submissions is determined by the offeror.  Q19 -  Can the offeror specifically breakout the percentage allocated to each of the technical and cost areas?  A19 -  No.  Q20 -  Is the offeror requesting a firm fixed price to perform the requested tasks or a schedule of rates for the requested Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN)?  A20 -  See Section (v).  The offerors’ price proposal shall reflect a firm-fixed hourly rate for each proposed position that shows 2080 man hours per year.  The cumulative sum of all proposed positions, including man hours, should total a firm-fixed price (1 Job) for the Base Year and each Option Year thereafter.  Q21 -  If the Offeror is requesting a firm fixed price, can the offeror provide the estimated staffing or hours required as many of the tasks are not quantifiable (i.e. support for troubleshooting, analysis of financial and reporting systems, support to identify, analyze, and resolve BFMS and RMS related problems, etc…)?  A21 -  Please refer to Statement of Work (SOW) as a firm-fixed price (FFP) is required for the Base requirement, which is one (1) job.  Also, note that a FFP is requested for all options.
Q22 -  Are there specific experience or educational requirements for the proposed staffing classifications?
A22 -  See Section entitled “REQUIRED CONTRACTOR CAPABILITIES” in Section (vi) of the RFP.

Q23 -  Is there an incumbent on this contract?  A23 -  Please refer to the answer to Question No. 4 above.
Q24 -  Can the incumbent bid on this solicitation?  A24 -   Please refer to the answer to Question No. 11 above.  Q25 -  When is the expiration date on the incumbent?  A25 -   February 28, 2005.  Q26 -  What is the number of staff currently working on this project?  A26 -   Please refer to the answer to Question No. 16 above.  Q27 -  What are the hours of operation?  A27 -   The Contractor must be available an 8-hour period between the core hours of 7:15am  to 6:30pm.   Q28 -  Are there scattered hours of operation allowed?

Q32 -  Besides BFMS and RMS reporting systems, are there any other systems that you suggest we explore?  If so, how many are there, and which ones would you like us to further explore?
A32 -  You should mainly be concerned about the financial reporting systems for this requirement that are stated in the Statement of Work.  PLEASE BE MINDFUL THAT THE LAST DAY FOR QUESTIONS WAS JANUARY 19, 2005.  PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS, OFFICE OF CONTRACTS, ATTENTION: MARLENE BROOKS, 330 C STREET, SW, ROOM 2527, WASHINGTON, DC 20237 ON JANUARY 28, 2005 AT 2:00 P.M.

1.	How long is the workshop and training seminar expected to last (days)?

We expect the actual workshop to be from the evening of the 6th through 18th.  However we will have some individuals arriving and departing at various times throughout the period of March 2nd through March 18th due to airline schedules. 
 
2.	What are the expected start and end times each day?

8:30am to 5:30pm

 
3.	How many breakout sessions take place each day?

There will be one (1) main session with four (4) breakouts.  However, there will not be breakouts each day.
 
 
4.	Is the conference being held at the same hotel where the participants will be staying?

YES

If not is the contractor responsible for transporting the participants to and from the event facility?

The intent is for the conference and lodging to be located at the same hotel.  
 
 
5.	Does the contractor have the responsibility of providing registration services for participants during the event? 

No registration requirements
 
 
6.	Does the contractor have responsibility for identifying and purchasing conference bags, banners and signs? 

No. 

 
7.	What type of administrative support is required from the contractor for on-site conference logistics? 

As identified in the criteria for evaluation we will need a liaison between ADF and the hotel, administrative setup for producing (typing) printing, copying, and distributing certain material for use by conference participants.

 
8.	How many supplies do we need? Up to 50 participants max?  

Currently 50 participants

 

9.	This bid is only for one event coordinator, correct?

We are not specifying the staff.  We leave that to the vendor to identify the number of staff persons that will be needed to provide a timely and complete deliverable.

10.	Please confirm that the contractor should price one set of simultaneous translation services for the entire length of the conference (i.e., 16 days). By one set, I mean translation in one conference room for each day.

ADF is requesting simultaneous translations in the main English/French and French/English conference room for the entire period of the conference. We do not expect translation services for all the breakouts.
